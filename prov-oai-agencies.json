It came into operation on 1 August 1977 (with the first meeting held 12 August 1977) as the successor to the Geelong Regional Planning Authority (VA 2830). It's creation gave effect to the State Government's decentralisation policies and, in particular, Statement of Planning Policy No.7 (Geelong), which received Governor-in-Council approval in August 1973.\n\nUnder the Act, the Commission was responsible to the Minister for State Development and Decentralisation (VRG 51) except in respect of the Commission's statutory planning functions under the Town and Country Planning Act for which it was responsible to the Minister for Planning (VRG 65).\n\nThe Commission consists of fourteen members, five appointed by the Governor-in-Council and one appointed from each municipality in the Geelong area, namely the:\n City of Geelong\n City of Geelong West\n City of Newtown\n City of South Barwon\n Borough of Queenscliffe\n Shire of Bannockburn\n Shire of Barrabool\n Shire of Bellarine\n Shire of Corio.\n\nFollowing the proclamation of the City of Greater Geelong Act 1993 (No. 16/1993) on 18 May 1993 the Geelong Regional Commission was abolished.\n\nThe City of Greater Geelong was constituted under Part 2 of the Act; the boundaries of the city were described in Schedule 1 (of the Act).

    "title": "Department of Property and Services",
    "description": "Establishment and Functional Responsibilities 1978-1985\n\nThe Department of Property and Services was formally created by Order-in-Council on 16 May 1978. It was originally principally concerned with coordinating the provision of centralised services to other government agencies, the management of state elections, and the provision of information services to the public through a number of operational units, including the Victorian Government Printing Office (VA 1035), Government Computing Service (VA 1857), Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages (VA 983), Public Record Office (VA 683), State Electoral Office (VA 1061), Government Statist and Actuary (VA 989), and Government Courier Service (VA 1858). The Land Monitoring Division (VA 680) also operated within the Department until it was transferred to the Department of Management and Budget (VA 1022) in 1985.\n\nIn November 1981 the government information service and the government courier service were transferred to the Department from the Department of the Premier (VA 2717). Responsibility for government motor transport was also transferred from the Department of the Premier (VA 2717) in 1984.\n\nExpansion of Responsibilities 1985\n\nIn 1985 following extensive machinery of government changes the Department was re-organised to enhance its role in relation to property and asset management, land identification and management, and land information services. The Department assumed responsibility for the following operating units:\n\n the Property and Services Division from the Public Works Department (VA 669)\n\n the Titles Office and Registrar-General's Office (VA 862) from the Law Department (VA 864)\n\n Land Information Services from the Law Department (VA 2825)\n\n LANDATA from the Ministry of Planning and Environment (VA 1024)\n\n the Surveyor-General's Office from the Department of Conservation, Forests and Lands (VA 1034)\n\n the Government Employee Housing Authority (VA 1356) from the Ministry of Housing (VA 609)\n\n the Valuer-General's Office (VA 2322) from the Local Government Department (VA 601).\n\nThe transfer to the Department of these functions reflected the Government's decision to consolidate land information services and transactional land and property related functions into one Department, including:\n\n providing leased and purchased accommodation suitable for occupation by government departments\n\n administration of the Torrens system of land registration for dealings in land\n\n creation of a state wide information system detailing all matters of land related data\n\n survey and mapping\n\n providing suitable housing accommodation for government employees\n\n providing valuation advice to government agencies and local government authorities.\n\n land monitoring.\n\nFrom 1978/79 until 1985 the Department of Property and Services (VA 430) had responsibility for the function of monitoring government land sales. This function was inherited by the Treasurer in 1985 and was the responsibility of the Land Monitoring Division of the Department of Management and Budget (VA 1022) until it was transferred to the Department of Planning and Urban Growth (VA 3006) in early 1990. In 1991 the function was transferred back to the Department of the Treasury (VA 3007) and remained with this agency until it was transferred to the Department of Finance (VA 3016) after the October 1992 election. In mid 1993 responsibility for land monitoring was transferred to the Department of Planning and Development (VA 3094).\n\nBackground\n\nAll purchases and sales of properties by Government of $100,000 or more require Land Monitoring approval to ensure that all Government requirements under the Land Acquisition and Compensation Act 1986 in relation to property transactions are met. The function was established to provide Government with an independent safeguard against further land dealings of the type criticised at the Gowans Board of Enquiry and later at the Frost Royal Commission. This function is completely separate from the budgeting and planning functions in relation to government real estate. The function encompasses:\n\n monitoring all purchases and sales of properties by Government of $100,000 including assessing submissions from agencies and monitoring of auctions.\n the development of policies for the management of government real estate\n assisting in identifying properties that are surplus to current needs. Administering the Government's decision in relation to the disposal of surplus railway land\n\nLandata\n\nThis function encompasses the development and provision of a comprehensive and co-ordinated electronic information network for quick access to data relating to any block of land in Victoria drawing on a variety of government agencies' records and information systems.\n\nBackground\n\nLandata was established to co-ordinate the land information records and systems of various government agencies and to develop a computerised land information system for Victoria to provide ready access to information on each block of land in the State. In October 1982 a project team began developing a five year corporate plan for Landata, in conjunction with key user agencies. Responsibility for this function was transferred from the Department of Planning (VA 599) along with other planning functions in 1983. Landata became a division of the Ministry in January 1984.\n\nIn March 1985, following machinery of government changes, Landata was transferred to the Department of Property and Services (VA 430) and grouped administratively with other major land information and land administration agencies within the Department, such as the Titles Office, the Division of Survey and Mapping and the Valuer-General's Office. Prior to this the Government Computing Service of the Department of Property and Services had provided the Landata Division with advice on technical specifications for computing equipment for the Landata system. In January 1991 this function was transferred to the Ministry of Finance (VA 3016).\n\nFurther Responsibilities from 1988\n\nFollowing more machinery of government changes in 1988 the Department assumed responsibility for the following functions:\n\n sale of Crown lands, particularly by public auction, from the Department of Conservation, Forests and Lands (VA 1034)\n\n supply of furniture, stores and equipment, fitting out government accommodation, maintenance of air-conditioning, and related survey and drafting functions for government constructions from the Ministry of Housing and Construction (VA 2907)\n\n restraint and monitoring of prices, through the Office of Prices, following the transfer from the Department of Industry, Technology and Resources (VA 2661) of the Office of the Prices Commissioner and the Prices Peg Secretariat.\n\nIn September 1989 the Office of Prices was transferred again to the Ministry of Consumer Affairs (VA 1026).\n\nThe Department also provides administrative support to a number of small statutory authorities such as the:\n\n Electoral Commission\n Surveyor's Board\n Municipal Valuation Fees Committee\n Public Records Advisory Council.\n\nAbolition of the Department of Property and Services\n\nFollowing significant machinery of government changes in January 1991, the Department of Property and Services was abolished and its functions transferred to the Ministry for the Arts (VA 1025), Department of the Treasury (VA 3007), the Attorney-General's Department (VA 2825), the Ministry for Ethnic, Municipal and Community Affairs (VA 3015) and the Ministry of Finance (VA 3016).\n\nLocation of Records\n\nSee also List of Holdings 2nd edition, 1985, section 3.18.1."

The SCV became the co-ordinating body for teacher education in Victoria.\n\nThe first teacher training colleges were established in the 1920s at Ballarat, Bendigo and Melbourne. In the 1950s and 1960s, further colleges were opened in Geelong, Toorak, Burwood, Coburg and Frankston. These colleges offered teacher education programs for general primary and secondary school teachers. Other colleges for training specialist secondary and technical teachers were also established.\n\nThe State College of Victoria was established as a federation of former Education Department Teacher Training Colleges, the Kindergarten Teachers College and the Catholic Education Colleges. Following its establishment, the teacher training institutions ceased to be under the direct control of the Education Department.\n\nThe primary role of SCV was to co-ordinate and develop teacher training in Victoria by:\n\\* co-ordinating and fostering the development of the teachers college system through a Senate and Academic Board\n\\* training teachers for the areas of pre-school, primary, secondary and technical education\n\\* providing opportunities for upgrading of qualification of experienced teachers\n\\* providing places for vocational courses closely associated with teacher education\n\\* awarding degrees and diplomas\n\nIn 1978, the Committee of Inquiry into Post-Secondary Education (Partridge Committee) recommended that both the State College of Victoria and the Victoria Institute of Colleges (VA 571) be discontinued. The Victorian Post-Secondary Education Commission (VPSEC; VA721) was set up as a statutory authority under the provisions of the Post-Secondary Education Act 1978 (no. 9145). Following receipt of submissions in 1979 and discussions with interested bodies, VPSEC recommended to the Minister of Education that the separate administrations of the Victoria Institute of Colleges (VIC) and the State College of Victoria (SCV) be discontinued. Under the provisions of the Post-Secondary Education (Amendment) Act 1980 (No. 9424), VIC and SCV were abolished and their functions and assets were transferred to VPSEC."

    "description": "The Heidelberg Road Trust was constituted in 1841 as a result of an Act of the Governor and Legislative Council of New South Wales entitled An Act to provide for the making and repairing of Parish Roads in the Colony of New South Wales 1841 (4 Vic., No. 12). This Act was repealed by Section 1 of An Act for Making and Improving Roads in the Colony of Victoria 1853 (16 Vic., No.40), which authorised the transformation of Road Trusts into District Road Boards. The Heidelberg Road Trust was proclaimed the Heidelberg Road District in accordance with the 1853 Act on the 8th of October 1860 (published in the Government Gazette on 12th October 1860).\n\nThe Shires Statute Amendment Act 1870 (34 Vic., No. 387) Section 22 enabled Road Districts where the net annual value of the general rate amounted to or exceeded the sum of twelve thousand pounds to become Shires. In such situations, any subdivisions of the Road District were to become the Ridings of the Shire. In accordance with the 1870 Act, the Heidelberg Road District became the Shire of Heidelberg on 23rd of January 1871 (published in the Government Gazette on 27th January 1871). Its three subdivisions became the Ridings of Heidelberg, Greensborough & Ivanhoe.\n\nThe Local Government Act 1890 (54 Vic., No. 1112) enabled the Governor-in-Council to subdivide or resubdivide any municipal district into up to eight subdivisions upon receipt of a petition signed by more than a quarter of the rate payers requesting that the subdivision be undertaken. Notice of receipt of a petition requesting that the Shire of Heidelberg be resubdivided into four Ridings was published in the Government Gazette on 10th of April 1891. In response to the petition, the Governor-in-Council resubdivided the Shire of Heidelberg into the Ridings of Fairfield, Heidelberg, Greensborough, and Ivanhoe. The boundaries of the Shire of Heidelberg were altered by the Governor-in-Council on the advice of the Executive Council on 30th of May 1916 (published in the Government Gazette on 31st of May 1916) in accordance with the Local Government Act 1915 (Act No. 2686).\n\nThe Shire of Heidelberg was declared a City on the 10th of April 1934 (published in the Government Gazette on the 11th of April 1934). This was in response to a petition requesting that the Governor in Council declare the Shire a City in accordance with the Local Government Act 1928 (Act No. 3720) as amended by the Local Government (Shire of Heidelberg) Act 1933 (Act No. 4153).\n\nThe City of Heidelberg was resubdivided from four to six subdivisions in accordance with the Local Government Act 1946 (Act No. 5203), which enabled the Governor-in-Council to divide any municipal district into up to eight subdivisions upon application by the council of the municipal district involved. Notification of the subdivision, which occurred on the 27th of May 1952, was published in the Government Gazette on the 28th of May 1952. The Ridings of Fairfield, Heidelberg, Greensborough, and Ivanhoe became the North Ward, West Ward, East Ward, West Central Ward, East Central Ward, and South Ward. The South Ward was severed from the City of Heidelberg and annexed to the City of Northcote (VA 520) by Order in Council dated 24th of July 1962 in accordance with the Local Government Act 1958 (Act No. 6299), as amended. This was to take effect on the 1st of October 1962. As a consequence the boundary of the City of Heidelberg was reduced and redefined, and the West Central Ward was redefined (notice of which was published in the Government Gazette on 25th of July 1962).\n\nThe North Ward of the City of Heidelberg was severed to create the Shire of Diamond Valley (VA 717) by Order-in-Council on 17th of March 1964 (published in the Government Gazette on 18th March 1964). The Order was to take effect on the 30th of September 1964, except for the purposes of the first elections of councillors and related matters which was to commence from 29th of May 1964. As a result, the boundaries and wards of the City of Heidelberg were redefined by Order-in-Council dated the 13th of October 1964 (published in the Government Gazette on 21st of October 1964). The East Ward was redefined, and the remaining wards (East Central, West, and West Central) remained unaltered. This changed on the 24th of May 1966 when a further resubdivision (published in the Government Gazette on the 25th of May 1966) constituted the Wards of Warringal and Macleod, and changed the names of the West Central Ward to the Ivanhoe Ward, the East Central Ward to Ivanhoe East Ward, and the West Ward to Heidelberg West Ward. The alteration was to take effect from the day of the next annual election of Councillors, which occurred on the 1st of September 1966). A further resubdivision occurred by Order-in-Council dated the 7th of December 1976 (published in the Government Gazette on the 15th of December 1976). The Order, which was to take effect from the 31st of May 1977, constituted the ward of Banyule and Eaglemont, reduced and redefined the Ward of Macleod, and enlarged and redefined the wards of Ivanhoe and Heidelberg West.\n\nThe City of Heidelberg council was abolished on 15 December 1994 as part of a state wide program of local government reform enacted between 1993 and 1995. The reform process reduced the number of councils from 210 to 78. The Banyule City Council (VA 3670) has been appointed as the successor in law of the City of Heidelberg and has assumed its rights, assets and liabilities. The Mont Park/Bundoora Health Precinct of the City of Heidelberg became part of the City of Darebin (VA 3683), whilst the rest of the City of Heidelberg became part of Banyule City."

They also provide for the Governor to grant pardons and make grants of Crown Land, and for the Governor to act on the advice of the Executive Council (VA 2903), unless exceptional circumstances arise (clause VI, Royal Instructions). The State Government advises the monarch on the appointment of the Governor, this advice being routed through the British Commonwealth and Foreign Office until 1986, when the Australia Acts enabled the Premier to tender advice to the Queen.\n\nLegislative or lawmaking power is vested in Parliament comprising the Crown and two elected Houses, the Legislative Assembly (VA 2585) and the Legislative Council (VA 471); (1975 Act, sections 15 and 16; 1855 Act, section I). The Governor does not sit in Parliament, but exercises the royal prerogative of assenting to bills as the Crown's representative, with the exception, until 1986, of those bills reserved for royal assent which included bills which altered the Constitution, affected the Governor's salary or pension entitlements, or were required to be reserved by a post-1907 Act of the State Parliament (as provided in the Imperial Australian State Constitution Act 1907). The Governor summons and prorogues Parliament and has the power to dissolve the Legislative Assembly and, in cases of deadlock between the two Houses, the Legislative Council (1975 Act, sections 8 and 66 (2); 1855 Act, section XXVIII). The Governor can also recommend amendments to bills presented for royal assent (1975 Act, section 14; 1855 Act, section XXXVI).\n\nApart from money bills, legislation can be initiated by any member of either House, although in practice almost all bills are introduced by Ministers as a result of policy decisions taken in Cabinet.\n\nThe Constitution establishes Parliament's financial control over the imposition of taxes, consolidated revenue and its appropriation for public purposes. Money bills - those imposing taxes and appropriating revenue - must originate in the Legislative Assembly and may be rejected, but not amended, by the Legislative Council (1975 Act, sections 89-93, and 1855 Act, sections LV, XLIV-V, XLVII re controls over consolidated revenue; 1975 Act, sections 62-65, and 1855 Act, sections LVI-LVII re taxation and appropriation bills). The Governor must recommend taxation and appropriation bills to the Assembly (1975 Act, section 63) and issues warrants to the Treasurer for expenditure of consolidated revenue (1975 Act, section 93; 1855 Act, section LVIII).\n\nUltimate executive power, the power to execute or apply the laws made by Parliament, is vested in the Crown and is formally exercised by the Governor, as the Crown's representative, generally with the advice of the Executive Council. The Constitution provides for the appointment by the Governor of a specified number of officers from the Legislative Assembly and Legislative Council as Ministers of the Crown. These Ministers are also appointed as members of the Executive Council (1975 Act, sections 50-51; section XVIII of the 1855 Act, which provided that four of the seven responsible officers of Government or Ministers of the Crown be members of Parliament, was replaced by the 1859 Officials in Parliament Act, the original basis for the current provisions regarding the appointment of Ministers and members of the Executive Council). The Governor acting on the advice of the Executive Council is given numerous powers under Acts of the Parliament, for example to make Orders-in-Council and regulations, to appoint and dismiss public officials.\n\nConstitutional Conventions and Cabinet Government\n\nKey features of the system of Government in Victoria are derived from constitutional conventions, customs and understandings which have evolved in Britain, America and Australia, as well as from formal constitutional law. The system operates through institutions, such as the Cabinet (VA 2989), political party structures, lines of accountability and power relationships that do not form part of the legal form of Government at all and are informed by notions of the separation of powers and the need for checks and balances. Characteristic features of what is variously termed \"Westminster\", \"Cabinet\" or \"responsible government\" that are based on constitutional convention rather than formal law include:\n\n The Governor, as the representative of the Crown, generally exercises his/her legislative and executive powers on the advice of and through the Ministers of the Crown (who form the Cabinet) in their capacity as members of the Executive Council; thus in reality the exercise of formal powers by the Governor with the advice of the Executive Council gives effect to Cabinet and ministerial decisions - Lumb p.73-4.\n\n the Chief Minister known in Victoria as the Chief Secretary or Premier is elected by a ballot of the parliamentary members of his/her party\n\n the Ministers of the Crown (Cabinet) form the Government and are appointed from the members of Parliament belonging to the political party or coalition of political parties commanding a majority in the lower house -in Victoria the Legislative Assembly; they are considered to be collectively and individually responsible to Parliament and through the Parliament to the electorate.\n\nReserve Power of Governor\n\nAlthough the Governor generally exercises formal power only, in certain circumstances he/she may exercise discretionary power, e.g. in cases of political or constitutional crises if there is doubt about whether the Ministry has Parliamentary support, the Governor may not take the advice of the Executive Council in relation to the dissolution of Parliament. This \"reserve power\" is supported by clause VI of the Royal Instructions, but the exact nature of the \"reserve power\" is not defined and there are no rules regulating the exercise of this power.\n\nHistory of Role and Functions of Governor\n\nFor a more detailed description of the Governor's role, powers, functions and history, see (VRG 17) Executive.\n\nGovernor's Office\n\nThe Office initially consisted of the Governor, a Secretary, Aides-de-Camp, Military Secretary and a Clerk. Until 1863, the salaries of all officers were funded from general revenue but with the proclamation of Act No.189, the Governor became responsible for the payment of all salaries from the Governor's own salary vote, except that of the Clerk. This separation of personal and official staff continued until 1986.\n\nThe Official Secretary was responsible for the provision of administrative services to the Governor and in particular for the maintenance of official records.\n\nThe Official Secretary was located within the Chief Secretary's Department (VA 475) until 1936 when the position was transferred to the Department of the Premier (VA 2717). From 1982 the position was located within the Department of the Premier and Cabinet (VA 1039) where it remained until 1986. As it appears that the Chief Secretary and the Premier had responsibility for personnel matters only the movement of the position between the departments has not been shown as a function transfer.\n\nAdministrative support to the Executive Council (VA 2903) was the responsibility of the Clerk of the Executive Council. From 1911, the Clerk of the Executive Council was required to perform the duties of the Official Secretary to the Governor and these duties continued to be jointly performed by the one officer until 1986.\n\nIn 1984, an Office of the Governor was established by Order-in-Council. This Office initially consisted of the Secretary to the Governor (previously the Secretary) who had Chief Administrator status. In 1986, following a further Order-in-Council, the responsibilities of the former Official Secretary were assumed by the Secretary and a single office, known as the Official Secretary, Office of the Governor, was established. This latter agency is located at Government House.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nSubstantial holdings of records have been transferred to the Public Record Office. Records are extensive up until the 1970's and some records of the 1980's have also been transferred.\n\nNOTE: Although the Official Secretary to the Governor was located within the Departments of State of the Chief Secretary and the Premier from 1863 to 1986 the records maintained by the Official Secretary have been attributed throughout to the Governor's Office.\n\nSee also List of Holdings 2nd edition 1985, section 7.0.0."

    "description": "Powers, Functions and History\n\nFor a description of the Legislative Council's powers, functions and history see VRG 17 Executive and VRG 20 Parliament.\n\nElectoral and Membership Qualifications\n\nThere were originally gender and class (education and property) qualifications for both members and electors. Through successive stages the property and educational qualifications were reduced and by 1937 the property qualification was twenty-five pounds and the deposit required from a candidate for election was fifty pounds. In 1950 the property qualification for members of the Council was abolished and adult suffrage was applied to Legislative Council elections. Women who met the property qualifications were not eligible to vote before 1908 or be elected to the Council until 1923.\n\nBy 1881 membership of the Council numbered forty-two, with a consequent increase in the number of electoral provinces, and by 1888 it had risen again to forty-eight. In 1903 the number of electoral provinces rose from fourteen to seventeen and in 1906 a rationalisation of the membership saw a decrease of members to thirty-four, two for each of the seventeen provinces with one member retiring every three years. With the increase in population the number of Legislative Council members has steadily increased, and by 1987 there were forty-four.\n\nDuration of Parliament and Presiding Officer in the Council\n\nThe duration of each Parliament is determined by the life of the Legislative Assembly (VA 2585), which is limited to three years, but it may be dissolved by the Governor on the advice of the Premier before the expiration of that period. The Legislative Council cannot be dissolved except in special circumstances arising from disagreement between the two Houses. Its members are elected for six years, half of them retiring every three years, but eligible for re-election. The President of the Legislative Council is the presiding officer and holds office for the period during which she/he is a member and may be re-appointed upon re-election to the House. If the Council goes into Committee to consider a Bill the Chairman of Committees is then the presiding officer.\n\nProcedures\n\nProcedures of the Council are governed by Standing Orders, Rules and practice, based initially on the procedures of the House of Commons, and administered by the presiding officers, that is, the President of the Legislative Council and the Chairman of Committees.\n\nThe sittings of the House commence with the reading of the Lord's Prayer by the presiding officer. Before the business of the day, as set down on the Notice Paper, is called on, Ministers may be questioned on matters under their administrative control; notices of motion, such as motions for the introduction of Bills, or motions of a substantive or abstract nature are given; petitions are presented; papers are laid on the Table; and messages from the Governor and from the other House are read. At this stage, members have the opportunity of moving a motion \"that the House do now adjourn\" which under the Standing Orders enables discussion on matters of urgent public importance to take place.\n\n\\*\\* Special Access Conditions \\*\\*\n\nAlthough records transferred from this agency are available for public inspection, special access conditions apply. The records have been transferred to the Public Record Office on the understanding that they remain the property of the Parliament of Victoria. Parliamentary records are transferred on condition that all requests for access will be referred to the Clerk of the Legislative Council/Legislative Assembly as appropriate, for determination in each case.\n\nApplication to inspect the records should be made to the appropriate officer and written authorisation must be presented at Public Record Office Search Rooms before records can be made available for inspection."

    "description": "Appointment of Police Magistrate\n\nOn 9 August 1836 Sir Richard Bourke, Governor of New South Wales, issued a proclamation authorising settlement of Port Phillip. Captain William Lonsdale was appointed Police Magistrate of the District on 14 September 1836 (New South Wales Government Gazette). He proceeded to Melbourne in HMS Rattlesnake, arriving on 27 September 1836. He was accompanied by the first customs and surveying officers aboard the Stirlingshire.\n\nDuties of Police Magistrate\n\nLonsdale was responsible to the Governor of New South Wales for the general administration of government in the District, fulfilling the role of head of government and of the civil service establishment. He undertook the normal duties of a New South Wales District Police Magistrate relating to the supervision of the local constabulary, the administration of justice and liquor licensing. His civil instructions of 14 September 1836 from the New South Wales Colonial Secretary (Historical Records of Victoria, Volume 1, p.49-54) set out his duties, including a census of the population and \"protection of Aborigines\":\n\n It will be one of your most important duties to protect the aboriginal natives of the District from any manner of wrong, and to endeavour to conciliate them by kind treatment and presents...and to improve by all practicable means their moral and social conditions.\n\nWilliam Buckley was to be employed \"as the medium of communication with them\" (p.53).\n\nIn addition, Lonsdale was charged with general oversight of survey and customs officers with authority to act for the Governor of New South Wales and to report on the performance of survey and customs duties, although survey and customs officers also dealt directly with the Surveyor-General and Collector of Customs in Sydney.\n\nLonsdale also had general superintendence responsibility for the following embryonic functions:\n\n health\n immigration\n lands\n police administration and prisons\n ports and harbours\n post offices\n trade and customs.\n\nHe was required to report monthly in confidence to the Governor of New South Wales.\n\nLonsdale's judicial duties involved exercising the ordinary jurisdiction of a Justice of the Peace for the laws of England in force over the Colony of New South Wales, as well as Acts of the Governor and Council. Where two Justices were required for administration of the laws, one of the officers accompanying Lonsdale was appointed a Commissioner of the Peace. Constables were appointed to execute Lonsdale's warrants and orders. (For other developments in the administration of justice and the local constabulary see VRG 4 Courts and VRG 10 Police respectively.)\n\nAppointment of Superintendent\n\nFollowing the appointment of a Superintendent for the Port Phillip District (VA 473) on 26 March 1836, the duties of the Police Magistrate, Port Phillip District, were restricted to responsibility for the local constabulary and local magisterial functions in Melbourne, and the position was retitled Police Magistrate, Melbourne.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nSignificant holdings of the Police Magistrate, except for early survey maps, are held at the Public Record Office of Victoria. However, as until separation from New South Wales in 1851, on many issues government officials dealt directly with or referred matters to parent offices in Sydney, records are found today duplicated in the Archives Office of New South Wales. In some cases the New South Wales records are the only extant archives.\n\nSee List of Holdings 2nd edition 1985, section 3.16.2, 13.18.7."

    "title": "Superintendent, Port Phillip District",
    "description": "Appointment of Superintendent\n\nThe position of Superintendent of Port Phillip District was created by the British Government on 4 February 1839. The Superintendent effectively held the powers of a Lieutenant-Governor and reported directly to the Governor of the Colony of New South Wales.\n\nOn 26 March 1839, Charles Joseph La Trobe was appointed as the first Superintendent of the Port Phillip District. He actually took over from the Police Magistrate (VA 472) in October 1839, inheriting responsibility for the general administration of government in the District and fulfilling the role of head of the civil service establishment (New South Wales Blue Book 1839, p.258).\n\nFunctions inherited from the Police Magistrate, some still in embryonic form, included:\n\n finance and revenue collection\n health\n immigration\n police administration and prisons\n ports and harbours\n post offices\n protection of Aborigines\n public works\n survey, management and sale of Crown lands\n trade and customs.\n\nThe Superintendent also came to have responsibility for regulating and funding schools, administration of the goldfields and the provision of Crown Solicitor's Services.\n\nFunctions Administered by the Superintendent\n\nDuring 1839-1851 the population of the District grew from 5,000 to 77,000. Government administrative arrangements reflected this growth and development. as follows:\n\nAborigines: The protectorate system was established in 1839 under Chief Protector George Robinson (VA 512) and continued until 1849 when the Guardian of Aborigines (VA 513) was appointed following a Select Committee report which recommended the abolition of the Protectorate. The Guardian was solely responsible for providing \"protection\" to Aborigines and the Crown Land Commissioners were appointed as honorary protectors, their duties being to visit reserves, report on the condition of Aborigines and supply them with food and clothing \"in cases of extreme emergency\".\n\nCrown Solicitor's Services: In 1841 a Solicitor was appointed to provide legal advice to the Superintendent and conduct criminal and legal proceedings for the Crown, marking the beginnings of the Crown Solicitor's Office (see VA 667).\n\nEducation: Early schools were run by religious organisations. In 1848 a Board of National Education (VA 920) and a Denominational School Board were established in New South Wales (VA 920-see List of Holdings 2nd edition 1985, section 3.8.2) to regulate denominational schools and provide for government funded education. In the Port Phillip District a Denominational School Board (VA 703-see List of Holdings 2nd edition 1985, section 3.8.3) was set up in the same year to regulate and inspect the secular aspects of denominational schools supported by public funding.\n\nHealth: A small general hospital was established in Melbourne in 1841 under Assistant Colonial Surgeon Cussen (see also VRG 8 Health and Welfare Agencies).\n\nImmigration: The Superintendent was responsible for administering immigration in conjunction with the British Emigration Agent in London who supervised the selection of applicants and arranged for their passage. In carrying out this responsibility the Superintendent was assisted by locally appointed Immigration Agents. Between 1839 and 1851 over 80,000 migrants arrived under Government funded and ly sponsored schemes as well as unassisted. Immigration was seen as a means of populating and providing labour for the District. A financial depression in the 1840s led to virtual suspension of assisted immigration. During this period the British Government sent out some ships with exiled convicts. Upon arrival the 'exiles' were given a pardon on condition that they did not return to Britain for the unexpired term of their sentence. Assistance to migrants resumed in 1847. The Superintendent's responsibilities included local administration of Government funded assisted immigration schemes, reception and initial settlement of immigrants as well as monitoring immigrant arrivals, including inspection of ships and certification of passenger lists, and regulating alien immigration.\n\nPorts and Harbours: Port Phillip had been surveyed and charted, basic ports and harbour facilities installed, and the first bay pilot licensed between 1836 and 1839. Under Superintendent La Trobe a Harbour Master, C.M. Lewis, was appointed, more permanent navigation aids installed (the first lights being built at Point Gellibrand in 1840 and Queenscliff between 1841 and 1843), wharf facilities improved and additional pilots appointed.\n\nPost Offices: The first full-time Postmaster was appointed for Melbourne in August 1839 and by 1841 the first Post Office was completed on the corner of Elizabeth and Bourke Streets.\n\nPublic Works: Plans for the District's early permanent public buildings were prepared by the Colonial Architect in Sydney. Public works were overseen by locally appointed officers under La Trobe's direction.A Superintendent of Bridges was appointed in 1844 with responsibility for overseeing a range of public works, including roads and bridges. The first permanent bridge across the Yarra (the first Princes Bridge) was built between 1846 and 1850. The Melbourne Gaol in Russell Street was completed in 1844.\n\nSurvey, Management and Sale of Crown Lands: Survey and mapping functions were undertaken by the Port Phillip Branch of the New South Wales Surveyor-General's Department (VA 943) under Hoddle, who was to become the Colony of Victoria's first Surveyor-General in 1851. Commissioners of Crown Lands were appointed to regulate the use of Crown land under licence, manage Crown lands and supervise their sale. The Commissioners reported to Superintendent La Trobe and received administrative support from his clerks in relation to the management and sale of land. (See VRG 27 District Land Offices for details.)\n\nTrade and Customs: Trade and customs controls were well established when La Trobe took over. Planning for the first Customs House had commenced in September 1837 and it was completed in 1841. It was replaced in 1857 by which time a larger facility had become necessary. In a number of areas, including survey and customs, government officials in the District continued to deal directly with their parent offices in Sydney, although the Superintendent was charged with general oversight of all civil administration and locally appointed officers received all their instructions form La Trobe. Increasingly all matters to do with the District were channelled through La Trobe.\n\nDistrict Counties\n\nIn 1843 the Governor of New South Wales established the Counties of Bourke and Grant in the vicinity of Melbourne and Geelong respectively. These bodies reported to the Governor of New South Wales through the Superintendent and were the earliest form of municipal government in rural areas of the Port Phillip District. Their primary concern was the development and maintenance of roads. However the scope of their role in the government of the District does not appear to have been firmly laid down.\n\nSeparation, Self-Government and Formation of Crown Colony of Victoria\n\nLa Trobe remained Superintendent until 31 December 1850 when he was re-appointed as head of government in the new Crown Colony of Victoria with the title of Lieutenant-Governor (see VA 466). The Crown Colony came formally into existence on 13 January 1851 under the provisions of an Act of British Parliament of 1850 passed in response to growing discontent in the District and pressure for separation from the New South Wales administration.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nSignificant holdings of the Superintendent's records are held at the Public Record Office Victoria. Official records of the history of the District, relating to the period prior to separation from New South Wales in 1851, can be found in the Archives Office of New South Wales as well.\n\nSee List of Holdings 2nd edition 1985, section 3.3.0 (Arts), 3.6.2 (Lands), 3.8.0. (Education), 3.10.2 (Immigration), 3.12.0 (Housing), 3.16.3 (Superintendence), 3.18.0 (Inquests, Registration, Survey), 3.22.0 (Treasury, Statistics), 16.5.0 (Aboriginal Affairs), 16.6.0 (Customs) and list below.\n\nFor records of the County of Bourke see List of Holdings, 2nd edition 1985, section 10.23.0 (VPRS 39 and 40)."

    "title": "Chief Secretary's Department",
    "description": "Establishment and Functions\n\nFollowing the achievement of responsible government in 1855, the central role of the Colonial Secretary passed to the Chief Secretary whose department co-ordinated, in addition to the departmental branches, a wide variety of other agencies not specifically assigned to other Ministers. The Department also co-ordinated the policy of government and acted as a channel of communication between departments. Consequently the inward and outward correspondence of the Department are a rich source of information about many government activities especially for the period to 1900.\n\nAs departmental and ministerial arrangements were formalised during the second half of the nineteenth century, other ministerial departments came to act more independently. Chief Secretary's remained, however, the principal omnibus department and its Minister was head of government exclusively until 1874 and then periodically until 1918. The Department was responsible for the administration of matters relating to head of government functions until 1883. Between 1894 and 1928 it was again responsible for this function through the Premier's Office (VA 672), which operated as a sub-department of the Chief Secretary's Department during this period.\n\nAs well as serving the Chief Minister or Premier, the Chief Secretary's Department inherited the functional responsibilities formerly exercised by the Colonial Secretary's Office (VA 856). including:\n\n\\* Aborigines\n\\* agricultural matters\n\\* census, statistics and registration functions\n\\* education\n\\* health\n\\* libraries, galleries and museums\n\\* liquor and theatre licensing\n\\* mining and goldfields administration, including the Chinese on the Goldfields\n\\* prisons\n\\* police administration.\n\nA number of these diverse functions gradually became the responsibility of separate departments, for example mining from 1860 (VA 2719), agriculture from 1872 (VA 618), education from 1873 (VA 714), and public health from 1890 (VA 2904).\n\nAmong the Chief Secretary's Department's prime continuing responsibilities from 1855 were the prison system and associated social control and welfare programs which were separated out into the new Social Welfare Department in 1970 (VA 946); the maintenance of law and order through the Victoria Police Force and management of other emergency services, which were inherited by the Ministry for Police and Emergency Services (VA 421) in 1979 when the Chief Secretary's portfolio was finally dismantled; the administration of policies and programs for Aborigines in 1855 and 1856 and from 1860 to 1968 when the Ministry of Aboriginal Affairs portfolio (VA 2873) was established; and the administration of mental health services and facilities until 1944 when this also became a responsibility of the Department of Health (VA 695). The Chief Secretary was also responsible for the conduct of elections until 1979 when the State Electoral Office passed to Property and Services (VRG 69). Libraries, galleries and museums remained part of the Department for many years until 1972 when the Ministry for the Arts (VA 1025) was established and these responsibilities were transferred to the new department. The Chief Secretary was also responsible for liquor licensing for an extended period and for the administration of laws relating to racing and other professional sports, gambling and betting. The Minister for Labour and Industry (VRG 42) inherited responsibility for liquor licensing in 1979 and the new Department of Youth, Sport and Recreation (VA 1028) took over responsibility for sporting and recreational matters in 1972. While some registration functions were only exercised for a short period in the 19th century, for example inquests from 1856 to 1869 and land titles from 1863 to 1864, census and statistics, including the registration of births, deaths and marriages, were a responsibility of the Chief Secretary's Department for many years, passing in 1979 to the Department of Property and Services (VA 430).\n\nOther functions developed within the Chief Secretary's Department and were subsequently taken over by new departments. Concern about employment conditions, industrial and safety issues in the latter part of the 19th century resulted in the regulation of factories and shops and, by 1900, when the first Minister of Labour (VRG 42) was appointed, this regulatory function had developed into a major area of government activity. Administrative support for this function continued to be provided by the Chief Secretary's Department until 1916.\n\nThe Chief Secretary had briefly exercised some responsibility for immigration between 1900 and 1904. In the immediate post-war period, the Chief Secretary became responsible for the State's role in joint commonwealth-state immigration schemes until the appointment of a Minister of Immigration in 1950 (VRG 90). However the State Immigration Office continued to operate within the Chief Secretary's Department until 1971.\n\nMore detail about the Chief Secretary's role as head of government and the diverse functional responsibilities of the Department is provided below under the following headings:\n\n\\* The Chief Secretary as Head of Government\n\\* Aborigines 1855-1856 and 1860-1968\n\\* Agriculture 1855-1872 and Animal Protection to 1979\n\\* Cemeteries 1888-1890\n\\* Census, Statistics and Registration Functions to 1979\n\\* Defence c1855-1858\n\\* Education 1855-1873\n\\* Elections 1855-1979\n\\* Goldfields Administration and Mining 1855-1860\n\\* Health 1855-1944\n\\* Immigration 1900-1904 and 1947-1971\n\\* Labour and Industry to 1916\n\\* Libraries and Galleries 1855-1972/3, Museums 1855-1976\n\\* Liquor and Theatre Licensing\n\\* Police and Emergency Services 1855-1979\n\\* Prisons and Social Welfare 1855-1970\n\\* Public Records 1973-1978\n\\* Royal Botanic Gardens and Herbarium\n\\* Sport, Recreation, Racing and Gaming to 1972\n\\* Other Responsibilities.\n\nTHE CHIEF SECRETARY AS HEAD OF GOVERNMENT\n\nThe Chief Secretary was frequently also the head of government or Premier prior to 1918.\n\nNOTE: For more information about the history and function of head of government in Victoria, see VRG 50 Premier.\n\nAdministrative Support for Head of Government Role\n\nAdministrative support for the head of government function was initially provided by the Chief Secretary's Office within the Chief Secretary's Department. By 1883, in view of the fact that the head of government was no longer always the Chief Secretary, separate administrative arrangements were made and a Premier's Department or Office (VA 672) was established.\n\nThe functions of the Premier's Department on its establishment were set down in an Order-in-Council of 29 May 1883:\n\n\\* correspondence with other colonies, governments and the Agent-General\n\n\\* correspondence with the Governor, including despatches from the Secretary of State in Britain referred by the Governor to Ministers\n\n\\* matters referred to the Premier and Cabinet by other Ministers or departments for their consideration\n\n\\* other matters concerning the Premier\n\n\\* issuing Cabinet circulars and attending upon Cabinet (VA 2989)\n\n\\* matters relating to the Public Service as a whole.\n\nThe Office's role in the central co-ordination of Government policy gradually expanded. Following Federation in 1900 it also became responsible for relations with the Commonwealth and other States.\n\nFrom 1884 to 1890 this Office functioned as a sub-department within the Department of the Treasurer (VA 865); from 1890 to 1894 as a separate Department of State; from 1894 to 1928 as a sub-department within the Chief Secretary's Department; and from 1928 to 1936 again as a sub-department within the Department of the Treasurer (VA 865).\n\nFrom December 1936, the Department of the Premier (VA 2717) and from 1982 the Department of the Premier and Cabinet (VA 1039) have assisted the Premier in his/her head of government functions and the co-ordination of government policies and programs.\n\nAn agency associated with the head of government role has been the Audit Office which was located within the Chief Secretary's Department until 1936 when it was transferred to the Department of the Premier (VA 2717).\n\nOffice of the Agent-General\n\nResponsibility for the Agent-General for Victoria in London appears to have been associated with the provision of administrative support to the head of government role.\n\nThe first Agent-General took up office on 1 December 1868, being created under the Immigration Act 1863 (27 Vic 175). Functions of the Agent-General, established under the 1863 Act included:\n\n\\* selection of emigrants and their conveyance to Victoria\n\\* making contracts for such selection or conveyance on behalf of the Government of Victoria\n\\* carrying out provisions of the Act\n\\* presiding at all meetings of the Emigration Commissioners.\n\nIn 1872 the first Agent-General's Act 1872 (No.441) was passed. One of the sections of the Act provided that the Agent-General should carry out the instructions of the Governor-in-Council and, in 1904, the then Agent-General was instructed to reorganise the Agent-General's office upon a commercial basis so that the development of markets for Victorian produce, the dissemination of useful knowledge regarding the State, and the correction of misapprehension as to its people and resources might be the chief functions. From this time the office of the Agent-General dealt less with emigration.\n\nResponsibility for the Agent-General remained with the Chief Secretary Department until 1883 when the Premier's Office (VA 672) was established.\n\nSupport to the Governor (VA 466) and the Executive Council (VA 2903)\n\nFrom 1863 to 1936 the Official Secretary to the Governor was located within the Chief Secretary's Department however records maintained by the Official Secretary have been attributed to the Governor (VA 466). Likewise, although the Clerk of the Executive Council was located within the Chief Secretary's Department from 1901 to 1936 records have been attributed to the Executive Council (VA 2903).\n\nABORIGINES 1855-1856 AND 1860-1968\n\nIn 1855 and 1856 and from 1860 to 1968 the Chief Secretary was responsible for the administration of policy and programs for Aborigines in Victoria. The responsible agencies were: Guardian of Aborigines 1849-1860 (VA 513) the Central Board for the Protection of Aborigines 1860-1869 (VA 514), the Board for the Protection of Aborigines 1869-1957 (VA 515) and the Aboriginal Welfare Board 1957-1968. The staff of each of these agencies were located within the Chief Secretary's Department. The Colonial Secretary (VRG 16) had previously administered this function. In 1856 and 1857 responsibility for Aborigines was vested in the Surveyor-General (VRG 18) and subsequently in the Board of Land and Works (VA 744) until 1860.\n\nThe Guardian of Aborigines 1849-1960\n\nThe Guardian of Aborigines (VA 513) was appointed in 1849 following a Select Committee report which recommended the abolition of the Protectorate System. The Guardian was solely responsible for providing \"protection to Aborigines\". Crown Land Commissioners had been appointed as honorary protectors, their duties being to visit reserves, report on the condition of Aborigines and supply Aborigines with food and clothing \"in cases of extreme emergency\" (see VRG 27 District Land Offices).\n\nThe Central Board 1860-1869 and the Board for the Protect... truncated"

    "description": "Establishment and Functions\n\nA Slum Reclamation Abolition Board was appointed by Cabinet on 19 July 1936 to investigate housing in Victoria after concerns were expressed about the ability of many local municipalities to cope with increasing demands for housing associated with the establishment of large manufacturing industry. Subsequently the Housing Commission of Victoria was established by the Housing Act 1937. Following an initial investigation of housing conditions a further Act was passed in 1938, the Slum Reclamation and Housing Act. The two Acts defined the following main principles governing the operations of the Commission:\n\n improvement of existing housing conditions\n determination of minimum standards with which new houses must comply\n reclamation of insanitary areas\n provision of houses for persons of limited means\n zoning, i.e. the division of municipal districts into residential and other areas.\n\nFrom this early period until the 1970s emphasis was placed on clearing slum areas and re-housing people of limited means at the cheapest cost. From 1945 funding was provided for public housing under the Commonwealth State Housing Agreements and the Commission built large estates of public housing (houses, units and multi-storey flats) in cleared areas in the inner urban region and in undeveloped areas on the outskirts of Melbourne. A Concrete House Factory, known as the Holmesglen Concrete House Project, was established to facilitate the cheap mass production of prefabricated houses.\n\nThe first significant change in the Commission's functions resulted from the Housing Act 1943. This Act enabled the Commission to let or lease houses to persons of limited means who wished to purchase a home. The Housing Act 1953 widened the objectives and powers of the Commission to enable it to cope with the planning requirements of large estates. In 1959 the Aborigines (Houses) Act (No.6498) provided for the Housing Commission to enter into contracts to build houses for Aborigines on behalf of the Aborigines Welfare Board. This responsibility passed to the Ministry for Aboriginal Affairs (VA 2873) in 1968. In 1975 the Commission resumed responsibility for housing for Aborigines when the Ministry for Aboriginal Affairs was abolished.\n\nRelationship to Treasurer and Minister of Housing\n\nThe Commission reported to the Treasurer (VRG 23) until 1945 when the first Minister of Housing (VRG 53) was appointed. Although the Commission was thereafter responsible to the Minister of Housing it remained administratively within the Treasury (VA 865), until 1973 when it became part of the new Ministry of Housing (VA 609) established under the Housing Ministry Act 1972.\n\nEstablishment of Ministry of Housing 1972 and Abolition of Commission 1983\n\nThe Ministry was established to provide for the better administration of the laws relating to housing in Victoria and took over from the Commission responsibility for central co-ordination of the housing function. The Commission continued to be responsible for the Ministry's purchase and construction program, the allocation of funds, general tenancy arrangements and house sales until it was abolished and the Ministry restructured under the provisions of the Housing Act 1983. The abolition of the Commission was effective from 1 January 1984.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nSome records of the Commission are held by the Public Record Office.\n\nSee also List of Holdings 2nd edition 1985, section 3.12.2."

    "description": "Melbourne Market Commissioners 1841 to 1842\n\nThe beginnings of the City of Melbourne can be traced to the establishment of markets in Melbourne.\n\nIn 1839 the New South Wales government passed An Act to authorise the establishment of Markets in certain Towns in the colony of New South Wales and for the appointment of commissioners to manage the same (3 Vic., No.19).\n\nThe Governor, on the advice of the Executive Council, could fix the number of Market Commissioners in proportion to the town population. If the town had a population of more than four thousand then the Governor could divide the town into wards (not to be less than three) and have at least two commissioners for each ward.\n\nThe Market Commissioners were to be elected from proprietors of land and householders within the town limits. The voters were householders or occupiers of dwellings valued at more than 20 pounds and proprietors of land or buildings to the value of 200 pounds. Market Commissioners were to hold office for three years.\n\nIn Melbourne markets were not established until 22 October 1841, at which time Melbourne was divided into four wards for the purpose of electing Market Commissioners. The commissioners held their first meeting on the 8 November 1841. The Melbourne Market Commissioners have been registered as a separate agency VA 3155.\n\nMunicipality of Melbourne from 1842\n\nMelbourne was created a town by the Melbourne Incorporation Act 1842 (6 Vic., No. 7). Powers of the Market Commissioners were transferred to the newly created Council. The four wards originally set up as the wards for the election of the commissioners became the four wards of the new Council. These wards were Bourke Ward, Gipps Ward, LaTrobe Ward, and Lonsdale Ward.\n\nAs set out in the legislation the Mayor and Town Clerks main duties were to perambulate the metes and bounds, a task that was to be undertaken every three years. The first perambulation took place on the 4 February 1846.\n\nOn the 25 June 1847 Melbourne was created a Cathedral City by letters patent signed by Queen Victoria. The Council began referring to itself as the City of Melbourne around this time, although the New South Wales Act conferring Melbourne with the title of City was not passed until 1849 (13 Vic., No.14).\n\nBetween 1850 and 1860 several new wards were created and new municipalities were severed from the City. Collingwood and Fitzroy Wards were created in 1850. Collingwood became a municipality in 1855. Fitzroy became a municipality in 1858. In 1856 Smith Ward and MacArthur Ward were created. Smith Ward continued until 1979, but MacArthur Ward was severed in 1860 to become Sandridge (later to be renamed Port Melbourne).\n\nOther municipalities were severed from the City of Melbourne during this time: Emerald Hill (South Melbourne), Richmond and St. Kilda in 1855, and Brunswick in 1857.\n\nBoth Victoria Ward and Albert Ward were added in 1869 bringing the total number of wards at the turn of the century to seven.\n\nIn 1902 a warrant conferring the Mayor of Melbourne with the title of Lord Mayor was signed by King Edward VII. On the 30 October 1905 the City of Melbourne was united with the Borough of Flemington and Kensington and the Town of North Melbourne (formerly known as Hotham). To accommodate the new citizens to the City of Melbourne a new ward was created. This ward was known as Hopetoun Ward.\n\nIn 1938 the Melbourne and Geelong Corporations Act abolished the office of alderman and required the election of three councillors for each Ward. The Council successfully petitioned for the City to be re-subdivided into eleven wards. Hopetoun Ward became the area once known as the Borough of Flemington and Kensington, Hotham Ward was the North Melbourne part of the former Hopetoun Ward, and Batman and Hoddle Wards were created.\n\nIn 1979 on the recommendation of the Local Government Advisory Board the City was re-subdivided into eight wards by Order in Council. According to the Order all councillors were to go out of office on the day appointed (19 May) and a general election held. This was later altered by the City of Melbourne (Re-subdivision) Act 1979, which decreed that councillors whose term of office was to end in 1979 would go out of office on that day, councillors whose term of office was to expire in 1980 would go out of office that year, and councillors whose term of office was to expire in 1981 would go out of office in that year.\n\nOver a period of two years the number of councillors was reduced from thirty-three in 1979 to twenty four in September 1981.\n\nOn the 6 May 1980 the Council were dismissed by the Minister for Local Government and replaced by three commissioners. In 1982 the Council was returned following a change of government. The City was re-subdivided into six wards and elections took place on 4 December 1982 under the provisions of the Melbourne Corporation (Election of Council) Act 1982. In 1983 at the election of the Lord Mayor it was decided that the position of Lord Mayor would be elected annually.\n\nIn 1985, due to the recommendation of a division of the Local Government Commission, the City of Melbourne was again re-subdivided, this time into seven wards.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nFor records of this agency, see list of series below.

    "description": "The employment of Protectors in the Australian colonies was first recommended in the report of the Select Committee into the Condition of Aboriginal Peoples tabled in June 1837. For New South Wales, five protectors were proposed with their activities confined to the Port Phillip District. Lord Glenelg proposed to the Governor, Sir George Gipps, the appointment of G A Robinson as Chief Protector of Aborigines and Edward Parker, William Thomas, Charles Sievwright and James Dredge as Assistant Protectors with these appointments being confirmed in December 1838.\n\nPort Phillip District was divided into four protectorates:\n\n1. Geelong or Western District with C Sievwright as Assistant Protector with headquarters at Mount Rouse.\n\n2. Mount Macedon or North Western District with E Parker as Assistant Protector with headquarters on the Loddon River at the foot of Mount Franklin.\n\n3. Goulburn or North Eastern District with J Dredge as Assistant Protector with headquarters on the Goulburn River. Dredge resigned in 1840 and was succeeded by William Le Souef.\n\n4. Westernport or Melbourne District with W Thomas as Assistant Protector with headquarters at Narre Warren.\n\nG A Robinson was stationed in Melbourne.\n\nThe duties of the Protectors, as outlined by Governor Gipps, were:\n\na. The Protector was to attach himself to the people in his district moving with them until they can be induced to assume more settled habits of life and endeavouring to make friends with them.\n\nb. The Protector was to watch over the interests of the Aborigines, prevent encroachment upon their property or mistreatment and, if necessary, make representations for them to the Government of the Colony or the Chief protector.\n\nc. If able to be settled in one place, the Protector was to encourage them in developing cultivation, in building suitable Habitations for themselves and in whatever else [might] conduce their civilization and social improvement.\n\nd. Of primary importance was to be the education of the children.\n\ne. The Protector was to promote and instruct in the Christian religion.\n\nf. The Protector was to learn the language of the people.\n\ng. He was to be accountable for any provisions or clothing for distribution.\n\nh. The Protector was to conduct a census of the Aborigines in his district.\n\nIn 1842, LaTrobe reported that the protectorate system was doomed to failure due to the inadequacies of the protectors and the anomalous character of their duties. This opinion was endorsed by Governor Gipps and the Colonial Secretary, Lord Stanley. As a consequence, the budget for the Protectorate was severely cut. An 1845 Select Committee was set up to assess the effectiveness of the attempts to assist the Aborigines. A second Select Committee, established in 1849, recommended the abolition of the protectorate system.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nConsult the List of Holdings section 16.5.0."

Local committees of three persons could also be appointed to act in conjunction with the Board and also officers to be called local guardians of aborigines.\n\nThe Board established reservations and supply depots throughout Victoria, with food and clothing available to the infirm amongst the inhabitants.

    "title": "Town and Country Planning Board",
    "description": "Establishment\n\nThe Town and Country Planning Board was constituted under the Town and Country Planning Act 1944 and commenced operation early in 1946. It was established to report to and advise the Minister of Public Works (VRG 28) on the planning provisions outlined in the Act. These provisions marked the beginnings of statutory planning in Victoria.\n\nFunction and Responsibilities\n\nThe Act gave the Board a number of mainly advisory functions. The most important was in the reporting on planning schemes developed by individual or joint municipalities and submitted to the Minister for approval. Any body developing such a scheme was described in the Act as a responsible authority. Planning schemes were begun either on the municipality's(ies') own initiative or through a directive issued by the Minister. If the municipality(ies) could not submit a plan within 12 months of that directive, the Minister could direct the Board to prepare the scheme in consultation with the municipality(ies) involved, thus making the Board itself in such instances a responsible authority. The Board was also responsible for reporting on the application of interim development orders prohibiting the development of land or construction of buildings or works in any area in which preparation of a planning scheme had begun. On approval of the scheme by the Minister, the Governor-in-Council and after publication in the Government Gazette, the responsibility for the administration of the scheme lay with the agencies affected by the scheme and not the Board.\n\n\nThe 1944 Act also entrusted the Board with the responsibility of reporting on any housing and reclamation schemes submitted under Part XXVVII of the Local Government Act 1928. As that section of the 1928 Act was repealed by the 1946 Local Government Act, this function was short lived. However the Board was responsible for reporting on schemes relating to the acquisition of land for the opening of roads under Section 592 of the Local Government Act 1928 (Section 594 in the 1946 Act). By-laws prepared by councils relating to the prescription of residential and business areas under Section 197 of the 1946 Act were also referred to the Board.\n\nThe Board initially consisted of 3 members appointed by the Governor-in- Council with a Chairman skilled in town and country planning. The first Chairman was J. S. Gawler with other members being F. C. Cook and A. N. Kemsley.\n\nMelbourne and Metropolitan Area Planning\n\nThe Board recognised early on that it was impractible to expect metropolitan municipalities to submit joint planning schemes. Concerned that such difficulties would prohibit co-ordinated metropolitan planning development, the Board helped initiate moves which resulted in the passing of the Town and Country Planning (Metropolitan Area) Act 1949. This Act gave the Board another advisory function, in this instance regarding the planning schemes drafted by the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works (VA 1007) relating to what eventually became the Melbourne Metropolitan Planning Scheme 1954 (but not approved until 1968). Prior to the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works becoming the responsible authority for the entire metropolitan area, the Town and Country Planning Board had organised a traffic census in 1947, details of which were published as an appendix its 4th Annual Report (1948/9).\n\nLegislative Changes 1958, 1961 and 1968\n\nFor the next two decades the Board's functions were relatively stable although in 1958 it was transferred into the newly created portfolio of the Minister for Local Government (VRG 57). Consolidating Acts, which were necessary to keep pace with the frequent changes to the provisions in the original Act, were passed in 1958 and 1961. This legislation did not have much of an impact on the Board's activities although the 1961 Act was notable for making the Board a body corporate. This meant the Board could now sue or be sued in law which was an important addition given the Board's power to draft planning schemes.\n\nThe aims of town and country planning were defined by the Board in its 16th Annual Report (1960/1) as to \"ensure the orderly and co-ordinated development of a community having regard to its natural environment\". However the Town and Country Planning (Amendment) Act 1968 established a three tier system of administration which aimed at providing planning at an overall State level as well as regional and local planning.\n\nThe Three Tier System from 1968\n\nUnder this Act the Town and Country Planning Board was placed at the top of the system as the first tier. A new major function was the preparation of Statements of Planning Policy which were primarily directed towards broad, general planning to facilitate the co-ordination of planning under the Act throughout the whole State by all responsible authorities. Such statements were to give regard to influences on development such as demographic, social and economic factors, conservation of natural resources, characteristics of land and land use, the environment, communications and development requirements of public authorities. The importance of this role lay in providing for the first time a co-ordinated outline of Government planning policy for responsible authorities who previously had to guess at such policy in the preparation of planning schemes.\n\nTo assist the Board in this task, the State Planning Council was established. Chaired by the Chairman of the Town and Country Planning Board, it consisted of 12 members being either the Chairman or Secretary of relevant bodies such as the Country Roads Board, the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works and the State Electricity Commission. Its functions were to act as a consultant and adviser to the Board and to co-ordinate planning by State instrumentalities and semi-government authorities of future works and developments for which they were individually responsible.\n\nThe second planning tier established under the 1968 Act included both the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works (VA 1007) as the responsible planning authority for the Melbourne Metropolitan area and regional planning authorities which were an innovation of the Act. Regional planning authorities could be established by the Board to prepare and carry out a planning scheme in line with the Board's statement of policy for any specified area extending beyond the boundaries of any one municipality. The participating municipalities were to provide the finance and representatives for the authority. Both the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works (VA 1007) and regional planning authorities in turn had the power to delegate to municipalities within their area, powers, responsibilities and interim development orders as they saw fit. These municipalities constituted the third tier of the system.\n\nTo hear and determine all appeals against decisions by these responsible authorities relating to applications for permits under interim development orders or planning schemes, the Act also established the Town Planning Appeals Tribunal, later the Planning Appeals Board.\n\nOnce the provisions of the 1968 Act were in place, the Town and Country Planning Board interpreted its overall responsibilities as entailing;\n\n promoting and co-ordinating town and country planning throughout Victoria\n formulating and implementing Statements of Planning Policy\n convening the State Planning Council and supplying services to the Council including sub-committees and working parties\n preparing planning schemes for authorities who could not\n advising the Minister on planning schemes submitted for approval.\n\nThe Board saw a clear distinction between its new responsibilities (the first three listed above) and its old ones. The new functions, which involved \"broad strategic planning at a high level, integrating the specialised planning of Government Authorities such as transport, public utilities and education\", were described as Strategic Planning. The old functions were referred to as Statutory or Schematic Planning. A director for each broad function came to be appointed. To carry out these functions the Board had a total staff of thirty four in 1968 although the Act did enlarge the composition of the Board to four with the appointment of a Deputy Chairman. Staff establishment was to increase at a slow but steady rate in succeeding years.\n\nStrategic Planning - Regional Planning Authorities\n\nThe Board did become busy in the area of strategic planning. Four regional planning authorities were established, the Western Port Planning Authority, the Upper Yarra Valley and Dandenong Ranges Authority, the Loddon Campaspe Regional Planning Authority and the Geelong Regional Planning Authority (whose powers were transferred in 1977 to the Geelong Regional Commission). Statements of Planning Policy were approved for Westernport, the Mornington Peninsula, Dandenong Ranges, River Yarra, highway areas, aerodromes, Geelong, Macedon Ranges, Central Gippsland brown coal deposits and the Victorian coastline. To support this activity a range of strategic studies were undertaken on a wide range of matters such as the classification of land for urban growth, open land zoning and regional studies, which aimed to define the boundaries for regional planning authorities.\n\nTwo additional strategic planning functions were provided by subsequent legislation. The first came in 1970 when the Urban Renewal Act required the Board to report on any urban renewal proposals. The other came by way of the Development Areas Act 1973. This required the Board to report on the suitability of areas earmarked for accelerated or controlled development such as the Melton/Sunbury area.\n\nSchematic Planning\n\nIn the statutory or schematic planning sphere the Board after 1968 continued to report on planning schemes submitted by responsible authorities and on the application of interim development orders, and to prepare planning schemes for municipalities which could not do so themselves. This latter activity, as had always been the practice, was limited to areas lacking sufficient resources to produce such plans. Examples of such areas included the Maldon tourist area and Phillip Island. The Board was also responsible for reporting on amendments submitted by responsible authorities relating to the Melbourne Metropolitan Planning Scheme.\n\nAdvisory Committee\n\nAs a means to aid the Board, the 1968 Act had also given the Board the power to constitute advisory committees. The four committees that were formed were the Yarra Valley Advisory Committee, the Advisory Committee on Places of Historic Interest, the Macedon Ranges Advisory Committee and the Metropolitan Waterways Study Steering Committee.\n\nThe Board was also an active participant on numerous other committees relevant to its function. These included such diverse interests as the Place Names Committee, the Airfields Committee and the Outdoor Advertising Committee. It was also heavily involved with the Federal and New South Wales State Governments in conjunction with other State agencies in the establishment of the Albury/Wodonga Development Corporation.\n\nCreation of Ministry of Planning 1973\n\nIn 1973 the administration of the Town and Country Planning Act passed to the newly created portfolio of the Minister of Planning (VRG 65). The Ministry of Planning (VA 600) which operated as a branch of the Local Government Department (VA 601), was charged with the task of co-ordinating the various agencies within the planning structure, inclu... truncated"

    "description": "Establishment\n\nResponsibility for the forests function was shared by a number of portfolios until 1909 when the Minister of Forests assumed responsibility for the Department of State Forests (VA 534). Until that time, responsibility had been exercised by:\n\nprior to 1875 Commissioner of Crown Lands and Survey\n1875-1890 Minister for Agriculture (VRG 34)\n1890-1891 Commissioner of Crown Lands and Survey\n1891-1893 Minister of Mines (VRG 30)\n1893-1899 Commissioner of Crown Lands and Survey\n1899-1900 Minister for Forests\n1900-1903 Commissioner of Crown Lands and Survey\n1903-1904 Minister of Agriculture\n1904-1909 Minister of Mines and Forests.\n\nFor convenience each of the Ministers responsible for forests from 1900 to 1909 has been placed in the Forests Group (VRG 41) for the period of their responsibility for this function.\n\nUntil 1908 the Department of Agriculture (VA 618), Crown Lands and Survey (VA 538), Mines (VA 2719) and Mines and Water Supply (VA 2720) were at various times responsible for State Forests. In 1908 the Department of State Forests (VA 534) was established under the provision of the Forests Act 1907.\n\nUntil it became a Department of State in its own right in 1918, it functioned as a sub-department of the Mines and Water Supply Department (VA 2720) until 1909 and thereafter of the Mines Department (VA 612). The Department of State Forests (VA 534) has therefore been included in both Mines (VRG 30) and Forests (VRG 41) for the period 1908-1918. The Department of Mines and Water Supply (VA 2720) and the Mines Department (VA 612) have also been included in the Forests Group (VRG 41).\n\nFunctions\n\nThe Department was responsible for State Forests and forestry policy, including issuing leases and licences, planting and/or thinning of forests, the development of plantations, forest renewal, protection and management, nurseries, forest schools, prevention and supervision of fires within forest areas, the development of commercial aspects of forestry including harvesting and marketing of produce, provision of recreation facilities, protection of wildlife, forestry research and recommendations on the acquisition or alienation of land for forest purposes.\n\nAlthough not formally recognised as part of its function the Department had a continuing interest in soil conservation from the 1930's. A Commission established in the late 1930's to investigate the issue recognised the need to control and monitor soil conservation and in 1940 a Soil Conservation Board was established.\n\nAdministrative Structure\n\nOn 1 October 1919 the three member Forests Commission assumed control of the operations of the Department of State Forests and all staff were transferred to the Commission. Although not formally abolished the Department of State Forests appears to have ceased to exist in the late 1930's. The Forests Commission inherited all powers, duties and responsibilities formerly exercised by the Department.\n\nAs a result of an Inquiry into the Public Service in 1937 the Public Service (Transfer of Officers) Act 1939 was passed which transferred the officers of the Forests Commission to the State Forests Department and made the chairman of the commission the permanent head of the Department. Thus the \"old\" Department was resurrected but the Forests Commission was not abolished and continued to operate as the controlling authority for forests policy and operations within the Department of State Forests. Over the years the two titles were inextricably associated and the agency continued to be known as the Forests Commission. Administratively this situation continued until 1983 when three Departments were consolidated into the new Department of Conservation, Forests and Lands (VA 1034) among them the Forests Commission (Department of State Forests).\n\nLocation of Records\n\nSignificant quantities of Forests records were transferred to the Public Record Office Victoria in the 1990s which are include in the series listed below. See also List of Holdings 2nd edition 1985, section 3.6.9."

    "title": "Department of Crown Lands and Survey",
    "description": "The Department of Crown Lands and Survey was responsible for the administration of survey and mapping and the sale, occupation and management of crown land throughout its existence. The Department was also responsible for closer settlement, soldier settlement, assisted immigration, unemployment assistance, land tax, agriculture, state forests and nurseries, the destruction of vermin and noxious weeds, the Royal Botanic Gardens and the National Herbarium, cemeteries and briefly, for Aborigines.\n\nEstablishment\n\nOn the achievement of Responsible Government in Victoria in 1855, the Surveyor General became the Minister responsible for all matters concerning the administration of crown lands including survey, exploration, sale, occupation and use of public land. Previously these functions had been administered by the Surveyor General's Department (VA 2921) and the Crown Lands Department (VA 2878) which had been the responsibility of the Chief Commissioner of Crown Lands.\n\nIn 1857 the Board of Land and Works (VA 744) was established because it was considered that the administration of public lands and public works would be more effectually and economically managed if it were consolidated and placed under one head. By Letters Patent of 28 April 1857, the positions of Commissioner of Crown Lands and Survey (previously Surveyor General) and Commissioner of Public Works were abolished and the powers previously exercised by the Commissioners were vested in the Board of Land and Works. The departments of the Civil Service previously under the Commissioners' control effectively became sub-departments of the Board. While there was clearly an intent to achieve consolidation, the extent to which the sub-departments were administratively integrated following the establishment of the Board in 1857 is uncertain and from late 1858 and the reappointment of a Commissioner of Crown Lands and Survey and a Commissioner of Public Works, the sub-departments were clearly administratively separate.\n\nAlthough a Commissioner of Crown Lands and Survey had been reappointed to the Ministry in 1858, statutory authority for lands matters continued to be vested in the Board until its abolition in 1964. The Commissioner of Crown Lands and Survey was President of the Board of Land and Works.\n\nThe Department of Crown Lands and Survey has been dated from the effective amalgamation of the Surveyor General's Department (VA 2921) and the Crown Lands Department (VA 2878) under the authority of the Board of Land and Works in 1857. The Department of Crown Lands and Survey remained a sub-department of the Board until its abolition in 1964. While legal and statutory authority was vested in the Board, the Department effectively exercised operational responsibility. From 1964 the Department of Crown Lands and Survey became a Department of State responsible to the Minister of Lands.\n\nResponsibilities of the Department\n\nThe primary responsibilities of this Department were:\n\nSurvey and Mapping\n\nThe report of the Civil Service Commission of 1859/60, described the activities of the Field Branch of the Department of Crown Lands and Survey. District Surveyors (see VRG 27) were responsible for the supervision of surveys within their districts; for supplying the Surveyor General with information relating to land proposed for sale; for recommending an upset price for such land and for determining sites which should be reserved for public purposes. They were also responsible for providing the public with information about surveyed lands and for the compilation of maps which were to be available for inspection at district survey offices. They were responsible for the work of the field surveyors who marked out land into allotments ready for sale; laid out roads and lines of telegraph; marked out sites to be reserved for public purposes such as schools, churches and cemeteries; laid out carriage and footways in municipal districts; occasionally determined the boundaries of electoral districts and took levels for sections and contour lines for other Departments. Some field surveyors were also exclusively employed on the geodetic survey under the direction of R. Ellery.\n\nClerks and draughtsmen employed at district survey offices were responsible for the compilation of plans, the preparation of tracings and the sale of lithographic plans of land proposed for sale.\n\nThe report of the Civil Service Commission also noted problems that had been encountered with the employment of contract surveyors and recommended that only licensed surveyors be employed. It noted too, the difficulty experienced by the survey department in meeting public demand for surveys required prior to the lease or purchase of land. The Commission recommended that the general survey of land for sale should be separated from the topographical survey of Victoria and expressed concern that there were parts of Victoria, the topographical features and geological formation of which were utterly unknown. At this time one surveyor was employed as Superintendent of the Observatory. In 1870, responsibility for the Observatory was transferred to the Chief Secretary's Department (VA 475).\n\nBy 1855, the Geological Survey had been associated with the administration of public lands and in 1857, following the establishment of the Board of Land and Works (VA 744), this arrangement continued. By 1858 however responsibility for the geological survey had been transferred to the Chief Secretary's Department (VA 475) where it remained until 1861, despite the recommendation of the Civil Service Commission of 1859-60 that it be transferred to the department of the Commissioner of Crown Lands and Survey. In 1861 responsibility for the geological survey was assumed by the Commissioner of Mines (VRG 30) and the newly established Department of Mines (VA 2719).\n\nIn 1862 when the Department of Mines became the responsibility of the Postmaster General, responsibility for both mining and geological surveyors was transferred to the Department of Crown Lands and Survey. In 1864 responsibility for mining surveyors was returned to the Department of Mines (VA 2719) and in 1867 that Department again assumed responsibility for the geological survey.\n\n In 1857 responsibility for the survey of proposed lines of railway was transferred to the Department from the Surveyor General's Department (VA 2921). In 1858 responsibility for this function was assumed by the Department of Railways (VA 2877).\n\nIn 1887 responsibility for the Draughting Branch (Land Titles) was transferred from the Department of Crown Lands and Survey to the Office of the Registrar General and Office of Titles (VA 862). This branch was responsible for the preparation and verification of plans associated with certificates of title and applications lodged under the Transfer of Land Statute.\n\nThe Department of Crown Lands and Survey continued to be responsible for all forms of survey including geodetic and trigonometric surveys which formed the basis of all subsequent cadastral (property) and topographic (mapping) surveys. The Department also conducted surveys for the Housing Commission. The Topographic Survey Programme was carried out in close liaison with Commonwealth, Civil and Army organisations in conformity with the decisions of the National Mapping Council.\n\nWith the passing of the Survey Co-Ordination Act in 1940, the Department became responsible for the co-ordination of all survey and mapping carried out by government departments and statutory authorities in the State of Victoria. This responsibility extended to the co-ordination of the survey activities of survey organisations, as far as that could be accomplished by co-operation and in accordance with the requirements of the Act. A survey network was established to facilitate the direct inter-relation of all surveys and mapping in one basic survey system and copies of certain plans were to be lodged with the Surveyor General who was required to maintain a Central Plan Register. The Department also established a Central Plan Office from which copies of maps and plans and subsequently aerial photographs could be purchased.\n\nBy 1982, just prior to the establishment of the Department of Conservation, Forests and Lands (VA 1034), the Division of Survey and Mapping (VA 3021) was responsible for undertaking surveys and primary mapping for Departments, statutory and land authorities; the co-ordination of survey and mapping activities and the registration of plans with the Central Plan Office and the maintenance of the geodetic survey comprising co-ordinated ground marks for the control of survey, mapping and scientific activities. The Division also conducted cadastral surveys to establish property boundaries and maintained parish plans. It was responsible for state aerial photography, the sale of maps and photographs and the operation of the Central Microfilm Bureau. The Division also provided administrative support to the Surveyors Board and the Place Names Committee.\n\nSale, Occupation and Management of Crown Lands\n\nAdministration of crown lands including provision for their alienation and occupation and the provision and management of reserves was a major responsibility of the Department of Crown Lands and Survey from its establishment. The administration of this function has also been undertaken by a succession of local land authorities including Commissioners of Crown Lands, District Surveyors, Land Officers, Bailiffs of Crown Lands, Local Land Boards and District Land Offices. Information about the operations of these authorities which were responsible to the central Department of Crown Lands and Survey may be found in VRG 27, District Land Offices.\n\nBy 1859, responsibility for this function entailed making recommendations to the Board of Land and Works concerning the sale of crown lands by auction; conduct of land sales; granting of sites as reserves for public purposes such as schools, churches and cemeteries and for recreational purposes; issue of Deeds of Grant for lands sold and for reserves; consideration of applications for occupation licences, tenders for pastoral runs, applications for permission to exercise a pre-emptive right to purchase part of a pastoral run; collection of licence fees and revenue from the sale of land and prevention of unauthorised occupation of crown lands.\n\nThe Land Acts of 1860, 1862, 1865 and 1869 provided for the sale of crown lands and for the occupation of land for a variety of agricultural and pastoral purposes. Applicants were able to select land and apply for permission to occupy the land under the provisions of a variety of leases and licences, many of which subsequently afforded a right of purchase. The Department of Crown Lands and Survey was responsible for administering these and subsequent Land Acts.\n\nThe Department had also been responsible for the issue of mining leases for metals and minerals other than gold (subsequently known as mineral leases) and water right licences which authorised the construction and use of races, dams and reservoirs for mining purposes. In 1865 responsibility for these functions was transferred to the Department of Mines (VA 2719).\n\nAlthough the provisions for alienation and tenure of crown land changed, the responsibilities of the Department of Crown Lands and Survey remained essentially the same. In summary it was responsible for the survey and subdivision of agricultural land; regulation of the alienation of crown land by auction and selection; settlement of disputes regarding alienation and occupation of crown land; issue of ... truncated"

The Chief Secretary's Department (VA 475) had been responsible for immigration.\n\nThe primary function of the department was to promote activities leading to the full and proper development of the State, decentralisation and industrial development.\n\nFollowing a re-organisation in 1972 the Department was also known as the Department of State Development and Decentralisation.\n\nEconomic and Regional Development\n\nResponsibilities in this area included the:\n\n relocation of secondary industry to country areas through the provision of advisory services, initial financial assistance and continuing incentives and subsidies\n establishment of new industries in rural areas\n improvement of amenities in country areas through the granting of financial assistance to municipalities and other agencies.\n\nThe Department's regional development role included detailed investigation of the resources of each of thirteen regions; consideration of their developmental problems and prospects; co-ordination of regional studies of matters such as land use, primary production, tourism potential, water resources and wildlife preservation; and identification of localities for accelerated development.\n\nThese activities were undertaken in co-operation with representatives of regional communities and other interested parties such as trade unions.\n\nIn 1978 these functions were inherited by the Department of State Development, Decentralisation and Tourism (VA 2881).\n\nNational Parks and Environmental Protection\n\nThe Departments' environmental protection responsibilities included the management of all wastes entering the environment and the control of air, water and land pollution, excessive noises and litter, responsibility for which had previously been separately exercised by many government agencies. The Department was responsible for promoting and establishing National Parks, their control and maintenance. In 1973 the Ministry for Conservation (VA 551) assumed responsibility for both National Parks and environment protection issues.\n\nTourism\n\nIn 1971 the Department undertook the role of department of state for the Tourism portfolio (VRG 59) when the Ministry of Tourism 1 (VA 2919) was abolished. These functions included:\n\n encouraging the development of tourist attractions and facilities\n promotion of tourism in the State\n provision of tourist information and travel services\n operation and administration of tourist bureaux\n acquisition of property for tourism development.\n\nFor a brief account of the administration of tourism between 1888 and 1987 see VRG 91 Tourism III.\n\nImmigration\n\nAn Immigration Division was established within the Department of State Development assuming responsibility for immigration functions previously undertaken by the State Immigration Office (or Immigration Branch) located within the Chief Secretary's Department (VA 475).\n\nThe Division administered assisted immigration from the United Kingdom, involving the processing of three types of nominations:\n\n personal nominations (later known as personal sponsorship) of British residents made by a resident of Victoria who may be a relative, friend or employer\n\n group nominations (later known as employer sponsorship) usually made by commercial enterprises seeking to recruit particular categories of workers\n\n State nominations (later known as State sponsorship) of British residents who were without personal or group sponsorship.\n\nIt also had responsibility for:\n\n reception and assimilation of migrants\n provision of migrant welfare services\n liaison with and support of voluntary and community groups providing assistance to migrants\n assisting in the investigation process of nominations under the Community Refugee Settlement Scheme\n\nIn June 1975 the responsibilities of the Division expanded to include the administration of nominations for unassisted immigration from the United Kingdom.\n\nIn February 1977 a Ministry of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (VA 1042) was established assuming responsibility for all immigration functions of the Immigration Division. Although responsible to a Minister of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, the Ministry continued to be administratively located within the Department of State Development and Decentralization (VA 552) until 1978. It was then located within the Department of State Development, Decentralization and Tourism (VA 2881), until 1981 when it gained full departmental independence.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nSome records are held at the Public Record Office. See also List of Holdings 2nd edition 1985, sections 3.13.4. (State Development and Decentralisation) and 3.10.2 (immigration records)."

(Neither order In Council appears to have been published in the Victorian Government Gazette.) The enabled the Borough to obtain a Government loan and to raise money through the levy of rates to construct waterworks.\n\nThis agency was responsible for administering all provisions of the Water Conservation Acts of the 1880s and subsequently Water Acts for the Borough when that act was proclaimed for the first time in 1890. It did not undertake responsibilities for the area covered by the Stawell Shire.\n\nThe official name of this agency is subject to further research. By 1905, the second schedule to the Water Act of that year identified the title of the agency as The Water Supply District of the Stawell Borough Council. Some evidence also suggests that until the proclamation of this act, it was also known as the Stawell Water Commission. The name of the agency underwent a minor change during 1957 when the Borough of Stawell became the Town of Stawell.\n\nWater Reforms\n\nUnder Section 8 of the Water and Sewerage Authorities (Restructuring) Act 1983 (No 9895) Waterworks Trusts and Sewerage Authorities were abolished. Water Boards replaced Waterworks Trusts and Sewerage Authorities, or the functions were transferred to Municipalities.\n\nBoth this agency and the Stawell Sewerage Authority (VA 2032) were abolished by an Order in Council dated 5 June 1983 issued this Act. Both bodies were effectively merged to form the Stawell Water Board (VA 4961)\n\nFinding records created by this agency\n\nResearchers are advised to check the list of series attribute to this agency and in the list for VA 556 Stawell II (Borough 1869-1957; Town 1957-1995) to locate records pertaining to water supply to the Borough/Town."

    "description": "Established by the Victoria Institute of Colleges Act 1965 (as amended), the Victoria Institute of Colleges was responsible for controlling non-university tertiary education in Victoria until 1980, when control passed to the Victoria Post-Secondary Education Commission (VPSEC; VA 721). Prior to this, institutions offering non-university tertiary education in Victoria (apart from the Churches and the army) were either administered and staffed directly by the Education Department, or controlled by their own Council, employing their own staff. The latter included the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, Swinburne, Ballarat School of Mines, Bendigo Technical College, and the Gordon Institute of Technology. Courses were to diploma level. Section 23 of the Act enabled the Institute to award degrees of equal status of the universities for courses of an appropriate standard undertaken in affiliated colleges. This power, together with the need for some administrative order, seems to have lain at the heart of the formation of the Institute (judging from the Parliamentary Debates Session 1964-65 Volume 278). Affiliation was by application to or invitation from the Institute.\n\nThe Institute was a body corporate, governed by a Council. Members represented Parliament, the tertiary sector in general, the Department of Education, the academic staff of the affiliated colleges, the Victorian universities, commerce and industry, the principals of the affiliated colleges, graduates of the Institute (from 1967 Act and 1971 Act No. 8115), students of the affiliated colleges (from 1973 Act No. 8496), and the State College Victoria (from 1975 Act No. 8710). An Interim Council was appointed in June 1965, and the first Council appointed in June 1967. The first meetings of the councils were in June 1965 and June 1967 respectively.\n\nThe Institute's responsibilities were:\n\n(a) to serve the community and in particular the citizens of Victoria-\n(i) by fostering the development and improvement of institutions offering tertiary education and of tertiary education other than in the universities of Victoria\n(ii) by assisting and encouraging affiliated colleges to develop and improve tertiary education to meet the needs of the community in general and enrolled students in particular\n(iii) by awarding degrees, diplomas and other awards to enrolled students of affiliated colleges who have attained standards approved by the Institute at examination in courses approved by the Institute:\n Provided that no degree shall be awarded by the Institute to enrolled students unless that student has successfully completed a course of study which is comparable in standard (though not necessarily similar in kind) to that required for the award of a degree at the universities of Victoria\n(iv) By fostering the general welfare and development of enrolled students between affiliated colleges, and\n(v) By entering into arrangements with universities and other institutions for the recognition of work done by enrolled students at affiliated colleges and for the recognition of work done at universities and other institutions by the affiliated colleges and the Institute\n\n(b) to provide such facilities for the aforesaid objects as the Council deems necessary or conducive for their attainment. (Section 5 Victoria Institute of Colleges Act 1965 as amended)\n\nThe Council was required to:\n\\* make reports and recommendations to the Governor in Council on matters relating to tertiary education in Victoria (other than universities in Victoria)\n\\* co-ordinate the activities of the affiliated colleges\n\\* make applications and recommendations to the Governor in Council concerning the financial requirements of the colleges\n\\* make recommendations to the governing bodies of the affiliated colleges concerning the appointment of principals of colleges\n\\* determine the staffing establishment for affiliated colleges in consultation with the governing bodies of the colleges\n\\* stimulate the improvement of academic standards in the affiliated colleges\n\\* carry out investigations and surveys in relation to the development of tertiary education (other than universities in Victoria)\n\\* report on matters relating to tertiary education (other than universities in Victoria) referred to it for investigation and report by the Minister of Education\n\\* make applications and submissions on behalf of the State of Victoria in relation to tertiary education (other than universities in Victoria) as required by the Treasurer of Victoria\n\\* with the approval of the Minister, initiate and foster the establishment and development of new colleges (from 1971 Act No. 8115)\n(Section 26 Victoria Institute of Colleges Act 1965 as amended)\n\nUnder the provisions of the Post Secondary Education Act 1978, the Institute no longer reported directly to the Governor in Council or the Minister for Education but to the newly formed Victorian Post-Secondary Education Commission.

The Melbourne Zoological Gardens were the first to be established in Australia. The first collections were housed in the Richmond Paddock opposite the Melbourne Botanic Garden. In 1861 the title was changed to the \"Acclimatisation Society of Victoria\", in 1870 to the \"Zoological and Acclimatisation Society of Victoria\", the prefix \"Royal\" being added in 1910. The animals were transferred to the present site in Royal Park in 1862. Although acclimatisation was one of the objects during the first decade at Royal Park, the efforts of the Society were gradually directed towards developing the Gardens and acquiring animals for exhibition purposes.\n\nEstablishment of the Zoological Board of Victoria (VA 572)\n\nThe Royal Zoological and Acclimatisation Society of Victoria controlled the Zoological Gardens until 1937 when financial difficulties were encountered and the Society requested the Victorian Government to assume responsibility for the Zoological Gardens and its extensive collections.

The Tribunal came into being in 1969 and held its first sitting on 28April of that year.\n\nThe Tribunal initially consisted of six persons and sat in divisions. Each division was composed of a chairman, who was required to be a barrister and solicitor, and two members. The members were to have knowledge that included town planning and public administration, commerce or industry. Changes to the legislation in 1970 allowed the number of members to be increased and additional divisions to sit. The Tribunal generally sat at its city premises but was empowered, where necessary, to conduct hearings throughout the State.\n\nPrior to the creation of the Tribunal the Minister for Local Government heard similar appeals.\n\nAdministrative support was provided to the Tribunal by the Local Government Department until 1974. In 1974 the Ministry for Planning Act1973 placed the Tribunal within the Ministry for Planning (VA 600). The Town and Country Planning (Amalgamation) Act1980 made provision for the amalgamation of the Ministry for Planning and the Town and Country Planning Board (VA 516).

    "title": "Department of Planning",
    "description": "Establishment\n\nThe Department of Planning was established in 1981 following the proclamation of the Town and Country Planning (Amalgamation) Act 1980. The Act amalgamated the Ministry of Planning (VA 600), which had previously been responsible for co-ordinating the activities of various agencies involved in planning, and the Town and Country Planning Board (VA 516) into the Department of Planning. The major role of the Department was the co-ordination of the planning functions of regional planning authorities and all other responsible planning authorities throughout Victoria. It also provided advice and assistance to these bodies to ensure that the planning process was fully co-ordinated and consistent with government policies.\n\nThe Ministry was abolished in September 1983 and all its functions transferred to the Ministry for Planning and Environment (VA 1024). With the establishment of the new Ministry further co-ordination of government regulation of land use was achieved as functions relating to environment protection, heritage protection including archaeological survey, Crown land planning and coastal management (both within and without Port Phillip Bay) were administered along with the general land planning functions the Ministry inherited from the Department of Planning (VA 599).\n\nFunctions\n\nThe prime focus of the Ministry was managing and controlling the use of land and protecting the built heritage of Victoria.\n\nOverview of Planning Functions\n\nThe State Government became involved with land use planning in the 1920s in response to pressure from town planners for improved land use and better co-ordination of services. Municipalities were given power to zone land for residential use in 1921. The Metropolitan Town Planning Commission (VA 3131) (est. 1922) recommended development of planning schemes with statutory force to be administered by municipalities. Little was done, however, to implement these proposals during the depression of the 1930s.\n\nPrior to the Second World War, the Victorian Housing Commission (VA 508) was empowered to require municipalities to prepare zoning plans for residential areas as part of the Commission's slum abatement programme. During the War, the Commonwealth used its control of funding for housing to pressure the States to adopt both town planning and regional strategic planning as part of postwar reconstruction.\n\nRegional planning developed into the regional development and decentralisation functions of State Development & Decentralisation (VRG 51) and was carried out through the State Regional Boundaries Committee (est. 1944) and subsequently by the Central Planning Authority (est. 1946).\n\nStatutory (town) planning began in 1944 co-ordinated by the Town & Country Planning Board (VA 516). Under this statutory regime, municipalities (singly or jointly) prepared planning schemes for approval by the Minister, and then administered the approved schemes. Interim development orders provided planning authority in areas not yet covered by a scheme. The Melbourne & Metropolitan Board of Works (VA 1007) was given responsibility for the Melbourne metropolitan planning scheme from 1949 to 1985.\n\nIn 1968, amendments were made to planning legislation which broadened the planning function to include \"strategic planning\" and introduced greater co-ordination. A three-tiered planning system was introduced. Planning schemes now operate within a framework established by State-wide Statements of Planning Policy and Regional Planning Schemes. This system, further centralised and streamlined by legislative amendments in 1987, establishes closer links with other planning mechanisms in areas such as transport, education, heritage protection, and environment protection.\n\nDevelopment of Statutory Planning Functions [Planning Schemes (to 1988)]\n\nFrom 1922 to 1929 the Metropolitan Town Planning Commission (VA 3131), financed partly by Melbourne metropolitan municipalities and partly by contributions from the Railways, Tramways, Harbour Trust, and the Board of Works, operated in an advisory and honorary capacity. Its work included research and recommendations on urban development and town planning. Its 1929 report (concerning zoning, transport, recreation, harbours and rivers, building regulation, and conservation) provided a model for those urging government to enact a statutory planning regime and for those municipalities undertaking land use zoning up to 1944.\n\nAs part of postwar reconstruction, the Commonwealth prompted the States to undertake both town and regional planning. In Victoria, town planning functions were set up on a statutory basis administered through the Town and Country Planning Board (T&CPB) (VA 516). Regional planning (cf. regional development) was carried out through the State Regional Boundaries Committee and subsequently by the Central Planning Authority.\n\nThe work of the T&CPB in the preparation, amendment, administration and enforcement of planning schemes and interim development orders included:\n\n co-ordinating and advising planning authorities responsible for developing and administering statutory planning schemes, and\n\n advising the Minister whether or not schemes and scheme amendments prepared by municipalities and other planning authorities should be approved and gazetted.\n\nMelbourne and Metropolitan Statutory Planning 1949 - 1988 [Planning Schemes (to 1988) Melbourne and Metropolitan]\n\nBecause most municipalities had failed to use their new planning powers, in 1949 the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works (VA 1007) was given the task of preparing a metropolitan planning scheme. Responsibilities transferred to the MMBW for the metropolitan area included:\n\n preparation or amendment of planning schemes and interim development orders\n\n levying of annual metropolitan improvement rate to recover expenses of planning activities\n\n administration and enforcement of the provisions or sections of the provisions of schemes including consideration and determination of planning permit applications and ensuring compliance with the planning controls and the conditions attached to planning consent\n\nThe first version of the Melbourne Metropolitan Planning Scheme (1954) was prepared by the MMBW and exhibited in 1953. The MMBW approved the scheme in 1958 but it was not until 1968 that the Minister for Local Government gazetted it as a legally enforceable document.\n\nAs a result of changes to planning legislation in 1968 the MMBW was given responsibility for statutory planning of an enlarged metropolitan area.\n\nThe 1971 amendment to the Mark I Scheme generated such widespread debate within the community that the Board re-evaluated its position and in 1974 published the Report on General Concept Objections to inform the public of its deliberations to the objections to the 1971 proposal. The Mark III plan, the Metropolitan Strategy, was presented in 1980.\n\nWhen the MMBW commenced its Mark I plan only a few local councils were engaged in scheme preparation. Local planning powers were not suspended but allowed to co-exist with those of the MMBW, leading to a complex process of land use control. In 1981 nine metropolitan municipalities had a planning scheme while 12 had Interim Development Orders, some requiring developers to apply for a permit from both local and metropolitan authorities. Gradually the MMBW negotiated with the relevant councils to reduce this duplication.\n\nIn 1979 planning legislation was amended to allow local councils to play a more clearly defined role. Subsequently municipalities were able to prepare local development schemes within broad regional guidelines. These schemes were to introduce even finer grained zoning than under the Melbourne Metropolitan Planning Scheme provided they did not conflict with it. Only one such scheme was ever approved and the local development schemes were repealed shortly thereafter.\n\nThe development control function of metropolitan statutory planning was largely delegated to local councils (around 60%) while the MMBW retained primary responsibility for permit applications concerning the boundaries of zones or reservations and for all land in certain zones, such as Rural Residential Zones, Reserved Industrial Zones and Special Conservation Zones. During the late 1970s and the 1980s local councils developed their role beyond that of making decisions in regard to planning applications for land uses and areas delegated by the MMBW.\n\nThe Development of Strategic Planning 1968 to 1988 [Planning (to 1988)]\n\nAfter the overhaul of state planning legislation in 1968 the functions undertaken by the Town and Country Planning Board were broadened to include\n\n the co-ordinated development of statewide general land use planning policies to provide effective guidance for the preparation of statutory planning schemes and co-ordination of planning mechanisms available to various government agencies and statutory authorities\n\n preparation of Statements of Planning Policy with the assistance of the State Planning Council, later the State Co-ordination Council. These bodies consisted of representatives of various service, development and conservation authorities and were to develop broad scale, strategic land use policy and produce statements of planning policy for specific areas or types of land use which when approved by the Minister and gazetted, became government policy and legally binding on both councils and regional authorities. Statements of Planning Policy which came into operation were:\n Statement of Planning Policy 1 (Westernport) 1970 (varied 1976)\n Statement of Planning Policy 2 (Mornington Peninsula) 1970\n Statement of Planning Policy 3 (Upper Yarra Valley and Dandenongs)\n 1971 (varied 1979)\n Statement of Planning Policy 4 (Yarra River) 1971 (varied 1979)\n Statement of Planning Policy 5 (Highway Areas) 1973\n Statement of Planning Policy 6 (Land Use and Aerodromes) 1973\n Statement of Planning Policy 7 (Geelong) 1973\n Statement of Planning Policy 8 (Macedon Ranges and Surrounds) 1975\n Statement of Planning Policy 9 (Central Gippsland) 1975\n\nIt was envisaged that regional planning authorities established under the post-1968 legislation would operate in most, if not all, the regions of Victoria. It was also envisaged that the Statements of Planning Policy would provide the guidelines for regional authorities to develop regional planning schemes (statutory) to be administered by local municipalities. However most of those regional planning authorities which were established were given primarily a strategic planning role rather than a statutory planning role.\n\nThe Planning and Environment Act 1987 [Planning, post 1988]\n\nAfter 1988 a more co-ordinated programme of statutory and strategic planning was conducted under the Planning and Environment Act 1987. The new legislation introduced broader heritage, urban and environment conservation planning controls into the planning process. Sections of the 1987 Act provide that all planning schemes must include provisions relating to the protection of both rural or natural area conservation and heritage and urban conservation including natural and other resources and the maintenance of ecological processes and genetic diversity. Planning schemes under the Act must also seek to conserve and enhance those buildings, areas and or other places which are of scientific, aesthetic, architectural or historical interest, or otherwise of special cultural value.

    "description": "Establishment and Local Government Functions\n\nThe Local Government Department developed from the Local Government Branch of the Public Works Department (VA 669). The Department was established in 1958 under the provisions of the Local Government Department Act (No.6479), inheriting all functions and duties relating to local government and the administration of the Act.\n\nThe Department of Local Government assists the Minister in relation to the:\n\napproval of statutory procedures such as by-laws submitted by municipalities\nreview and amendment of legislation affecting local government\nexamination and review of municipal boundaries.\n\nThe Department provides consultancy and advisory services to local government bodies in relation to administrative, financial, electoral and legislative matters as well as entrepreneurial activities and joint ventures. It also has a monitoring role in relation to the operations of local government bodies and is empowered to conduct inquiries into complaints concerning local councils and officials.\n\nThe Department had an oversight role in relation to the building control activities of local councils. In 1985 this responsibility passed to the Ministry for Planning and Environment (VA 1024).\n\nPlanning\n\nThe Minister for Local Government was also responsible for the Town and Country Planning Board from 1958 until 1973 when the portfolio of Planning was established. However throughout this period, the Department itself did not take responsibility for the administration of the Town and Country Planning Acts as the Board reported directly to the Minister. The Department did however have some administrative involvement in planning between 1974 and 1976 when the Ministry of Planning (VA 600) operated as a sub-department of the Local Government Department, although it was responsible to the Minister of Planning (VRG 65).\n\nValuations\n\nIn 1960 the valuation function passed from the Chief Secretary's Department (VA 475) to Local Government under the position of Chief Valuer, later Valuer-General. By 1969 a Valuer-General's Office had been established within the Local Government Department. In March 1985 substantial new administrative arrangements throughout the public service saw the Valuer-General's Office transferred to the Department of Property and Services (VA 430).\n\nWeights and Measures\n\nRegulation of weights and measures was also the responsibility of the Local Government Department from 1965 to 1985. It too was inherited from the Chief Secretary's Department (VA 475), and later passed to the Ministry of Consumer Affairs (VA 1026).\n\nServices to Older Persons\n\nFollowing the appointment of Maureen Lyster as Minister for Local Government and Minister for the Aged in 1989 the Older Persons Planning Office (VA 2997) was transferred from the Department of Community Services (VA 2633) to the Local Government Department to co-ordinate work in state agencies and to plan services and programs for older Victorians. The Office also supports the Older Persons Consultative Council, which assists in increasing community awareness of older person's issues, and consults with relevant organisations.\n\nAbolition of the Department\n\nIn January 1991 the responsibility for the local government functions and services to older persons were transferred to the newly established Ministry of Ethnic, Municipal and Community Affairs (VA 3015).\n\nLocation of Records\n\nSignificant records are held by the Public Record Office.

    "description": "Formation of Department of Trade and Customs 1851\n\nThe Department of Trade and Customs was established in 1851 under the Collector of Customs who was also an officer of the Executive Council. From 1855 a newly appointed Commissioner for Trade and Customs had ministerial responsibility for the Department and the Collector's position evolved into that of Permanent Head or Chief Administrator.\n\nResponsibilities for trade, customs, ports and harbours were inherited from the Superintendent of the Port Phillip District (see VA 473). By 1851 trade and customs controls were well established in the District under a Sub-Collector of Customs, also an appointee of the British Board of Commissioners of Customs. Prior to 1851 Port Phillip had been surveyed and charted, ports and harbours facilities installed, bay pilots appointed, permanent navigation aids erected and a harbour master appointed.\n\nFunctional Responsibilities 1851 to 1900/1901\n\nThe prime functions of the Department of Trade and Customs related to:\n\ncollection of customs duties\ndistilleries and excise\nexplosives and powder magazines\nfisheries\nports and harbours\nnavigation, lighthouses.\n\nPorts and Harbours\n\nFrom the beginning of the Department of Trade and Customs a number of functions were consistently grouped together administratively and this grouping subsequently became identified as the Ports and Harbours Branch of the Department. The Ports and Harbours Branch was responsible for:\n\ncontrol of vessel movements into and out of Victorian ports\nregulation of loading and discharging of goods including the collection of wharfage rates\nprovision of pilot services\nconstruction and maintenance of Government marine vessels\nmaintenance of navigational aids and operation of lighthouses, lightships and signal stations\nprovision of emergency services along the Victorian coast\nimmigration and emigration (see below)\n\nBetween 1864 and 1874 the Alfred Graving Dock at Williamstown was constructed by the Government and thereafter was administered by the Ports and Harbours Branch.\n\nIn 1877 responsibility for ports and harbours functions within the Port of Melbourne was assumed by the newly-established Melbourne Harbor Trust Commissioners (VA 2799).\n\nIn 1900, immediately prior to the abolition of the Department of Trade and Customs, the Ports and Harbours Branch was transferred to the Public Works Department (VA 669).\n\nAt this time the Branch was also responsible for the inspection of fisheries, which had emerged as a responsibility of the Department of Trade and Customs in 1873, following proclamation of the Fisheries Act (1873) 37 Vic., No.473.\n\nImmigration 1855-1900\n\nFrom 1855 to 1900 Trade and Customs was also responsible for functions relating to immigration, previously undertaken by the Colonial Secretary (VA 856). Operational responsibilities rested with the Immigration Agent, an officer of the Ports and Harbours Branch of the Department, for:\n\nadministration of assisted immigration and nomination schemes (to 1883)\nmonitoring of immigrant arrivals and departures, including regulation of alien immigration, naturalisation, and certification of passenger lists\nreception and initial settlement of immigrants (to 1883).\n\nThe promotion of migration and the selection and conveyance of migrants at the British end was the responsibility of the British Emigration Agent until the appointment in 1868 of the Agent-General for Victoria in London. The Office of the Agent-General was established by the Victorian Immigration Statute 1864 (27 Vic., No.195) to assume responsibility for promoting migration, selecting migrants and arranging their passage on behalf of the Victorian Colonial Government. The Statute which consolidated earlier legislation, including the 1863 Act (27 Vic., No.175), also provided for the employment of Immigration Committees to assist new arrivals to settle and find employment, introduced government and ly-sponsored nomination schemes, and provided for alien (i.e. non-British) immigration. Separate legislation, also administered by Trade and Customs officers, applied to Chinese immigrants who were required to pay an impost on entry and a yearly impost thereafter, which included their Miner's Right (see the 1854, 1857 and 1859 Statutes, 18 Vic., No.39, 21 Vic., No.41, and 22 Vic., No.80).\n\nDuring the Gold Rush period, 1851-1861, most migrants paid their own way and Government schemes of assisted immigration were largely eclipsed. By 1873, as a result of the economic situation, the government began to withdraw financial support for assisted immigration and by 1883 such immigration ceased altogether. The Government-sponsored nomination scheme for immigrants with special skills was also phased out. (It is unclear however, whether a nomination scheme continued for unassisted immigrants). Unassisted immigration from British and foreign ports continued strongly throughout the latter half of the century.\n\nFrom December 1900, the Chief Secretary (VA 475) assumed responsibility for the control of alien immigration and naturalisation and the Public Works Department (VA 669) became responsible for the monitoring of immigrant arrivals and departures in 1900. These responsibilities passed to the Commonwealth in 1904 and 1923 respectively. For details of the resumption of assisted immigration in 1906 when, under the Closer Settlement Act 1906 (No.2067), the Commissioner of Crown Lands and Survey became responsible for administering the nomination scheme, and for provision of reception, initial settlement and employment services, see VA 538 Department of Crown Lands and Survey.\n\nPilot Board\n\nPilot Board, later the Marine Board (VA 1425), was responsible for mercantile marine matters, including standards of marine safety, shipping registration and certification of pilots, ships masters, mates and engineers. Staff carrying out the functions of the Board were mainly located within the Department of Trade and Customs until 1901.\n\nFederation 1901\n\nUpon Federation the Commonwealth (VRG 87) assumed responsibility for the key trade and customs functions and the Victorian Department was abolished. Mercantile marine matters, explosives and control of alien immigration passed to the Chief Secretary's Department (VA 475), while the Public Works Department (VA 669) had inherited ports and harbours, including lighthouses and navigation, fisheries and the monitoring of immigrant arrivals and departures in 1900.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nThere are extensive holdings of 19th and early 20th century immigration records (to 1923). Naturalisation records were inherited by the Commonwealth and are held by Australian Archives.\n\nSee List of Holdings 2nd edition 1985, section 3.6.0 (Fisheries and Wildlife), 3.10.0 (Immigration), 3.16.4 (Colonial Secretary) 3.21.0 (Transport), 16.13.0 (Mercantile Marine, Ports and Harbours) and 16.25.0 (Trade and Customs).\n\nSee also list below for records of this agency relating to the Ports and Harbours function."

The Ministry took over responsibility for the Housing Commission, Home Finance Trust (established 1956), Registry of Co-operative Societies, Registry of Co-operative Housing Societies and Decentralised Industry Housing Authority, formerly part of the administrative structure of the Treasurer's Department (VA 865), and the Teacher Housing Authority which previously reported to the Minister of Education (VRG 35).\n\nThe Housing Commission (VA 508) continued to be responsible for the Ministry's purchase and construction program, allocation of housing funds, general tenancy arrangements and house sales.\n\nRestructure 1978\n\nIn 1977 the Government appointed management consultants to review the senior management organization of the Victorian Ministry of Housing and its constituent agencies. As a result of this report the Housing Ministry Act 1972 was repealed and the Housing Act 1958 amended by the Housing (Amendment) Act 1978 (No.9246) to provide for a reconstituted Ministry of Housing consisting of a Minister of Housing, Director of Housing and other officers as necessary.\n\nThe legislation also established a Housing Advisory Council:\n\n to advise the Minister on matters affecting housing in the or public sector\n to investigate any matters affecting housing\n to consult with the housing industry.\n\nThe Council consisted of the Director of Housing and six part-time members appointed by the Minister.\n\nFurther Restructure 1983\n\nThe Housing Act 1983 abolished the Housing Commission, Housing Advisory Council and the Home Finance Trust, and restructured the Ministry to provide for a stronger co-ordination and management of housing policy and programs in Victoria. The Act came into effect on 1 January 1984, its objectives being:\n\n to ensure that every person in Victoria has adequate and appropriate housing at a price within his or her means by encouraging:\n (i) the provision of well maintained public housing of suitable quality and location\n (ii) the distribution, according to need, of Government housing financial assistance for each type of tenure (including freehold and leasehold land and land held by a co-operative) and\n to expand and develop the role of the public sector in the provision of housing\n to promote cost effectiveness in the provision of housing\n to promote the integration of public and housing\n to provide in the public sector a variety of housing types in various locations\n to promote security and variety of tenure\n to seek the participation of tenants and other community groups in the management of public housing and rental housing co-operatives\n to promote consultation on major housing policy issues with all persons and groups of persons involved in housing\n to monitor the house building and housing finance industries in both the public and sectors and industries to achieve growth and stability\n to co-ordinate the provision of all necessary community services and amenities ancillary to public housing\n to formulate and maintain standards of habitation for housing throughout the State\n to maximize employment opportunities in the housing sectors\n to give due regard to the environmental impact of the activities of the public housing sector\n to provide a safe and satisfying work environment for persons employed in the public housing sector: and\n to promote public awareness of the role and functions of the public housing sector.\n\nCreation of the Ministry of Housing and Construction\n\nAs part of a machinery of government change in December 1987, the Ministry of Housing was replaced with the Ministry of Housing and Construction (VA 2907) which also took over the functions of the Public Works Department (VA 669).\n\nLocation of Records\n\nNo records of the Ministry have been transferred to the Public Record Office.

It also was responsible for planning for the possible introduction of nuclear energy. It played a co-ordinating role in relation to the activities of the large fuel and power statutory authorities, namely the State Electricity Commission (VA 1002), the Gas and Fuel Corporation (VA 1040) and the Victorian Pipelines Commission, and oil and gas companies. It also regulated the mining, extractive, fuel and power industries and provided technical and scientific advisory services.

In 1962 responsibility for the inspection of industrial boilers was transferred to the Department of Labour and Industry (VA 1027). With the passing of the Environment Protection Act in 1970, the Mines Department became an investigating agency of the Environment Protection Authority in matters relating to groundwater.\n\nState Forests and Nurseries\n\nResponsibility for this function was shared by a number of portfolios until 1909 when the Minister of Forests assumed responsibility for the Department of State Forests (VA 534). Until that time, responsibility had been exercised by:\n\nCommissioner of Crown Lands and Survey prior to 1875\nMinister for Agriculture (VRG 34) 1875-1890\nCommissioner of Crown Lands and Survey (VRG 18) 1890-1891\nMinister of Mines (VRG 30) 1891-1893\nCommissioner of Crown Lands and Survey 1893-1899\nMinister for Forests (VRG 41) 1890-1900\nCommissioner of Crown Lands and Survey 1900-1903\nMinister of Agriculture (VRG 34) 1903-1904\nMinister of Mines and Forests (VRG 30) 1904-1909.\n\nFor convenience each of the Ministers responsible for forests from 1900 to 1909 has been placed in the Forests Group (VRG 41) for the period of their responsibility for this function.\n\nUntil 1908 the Departments of Agriculture (VA 618), Crown Lands and Survey (VA 538), Mines (VA 2719) and Mines and Water Supply (VA 2720) were at various times responsible for State Forests. In 1908 the Department of State Forests (VA 534) was established. Until it became a department of state in its own right in 1981, it functioned as a sub-department of the Mines and Water Supply Department (VA 2720) until 1909 and thereafter of the Mines Department (VA 612).

    "description": "Establishment\n\nThe Department of Community Welfare Services was established on 13 February 1979 following proclamation of the Community Welfare Services Act 1978 (No.9248). This Act established the new Department by renaming the Social Welfare Department and hence all functions previously administered by the Social Welfare Department (VA 946) became the responsibility of the Department of Community Welfare Services.\n\nThe Community Welfare Services Act 1978 was tabled in Parliament simultaneously with the release of the first Victorian Government White Paper on Social Welfare which defined the Government's long-term policy objectives regarding welfare services in Victoria. The legislation was intended to facilitate the development of an integrated system of community-oriented and needs-based welfare services, with an emphasis on prevention rather than control of social problems.\n\nRe-organisation of the Department\n\nThe Divisional structure of the Social Welfare Department (VA 946) had reflected the primary functions for which it had been responsible and thus there were the following divisions: Family Welfare, Youth Welfare, Prisons, Probation and Parole, Training and Research and Statistics. Following the creation of the new Department of Community Welfare Services there was a major re-organisation of the administration which emphasized regionalisation. Regional centres increasingly became responsible for a range of functions previously administered by several different divisions. In particular probation and parole services became regionalised to such an extent that a distinct probation and parole division ceased to exist.\n\nThe administration of other functions was also re-organised and a number of new divisions were created. The responsibilities of these divisions reflected the Government's changed view of priorities in the provision of social welfare services. In particular there was a clear separation of the administration of adult and juvenile correctional services which had also been evident in the Social Welfare Department. From 1979 there was a further major shift in administrative perspective and juvenile correctional services became far more closely linked to the provision of family and child welfare services.\n\nMajor Functions\n\nAlthough the administrative structure of the Department of Community Welfare Services underwent a number of changes, the primary functions for which it was responsible were:\n\nFamily and Adolescent Services which included:\n\n family support services including emergency housing (until 1982) and women's refuges\n financial support to families and children\n protection of children including prevention of child maltreatment, regulation of school attendance, child employment and street trading and refugee child care\n adoption\n guardianship\n family substitute care\n reception centres\n residential child care\n youth welfare services\n youth hostels\n youth support services\n youth training centres\n youth correctional field services including child probation, youth parole and probation\n aboriginal services\n\nCommunity Services including responsibility for:\n\n disaster welfare support\n early childhood services\n social research, planning and policy\n community service grants\n volunteer services\n\nTraining including:\n\n training and certification of persons working in government and non-government welfare work including child care, youth work, welfare work and prison services\n training honorary probation officers and volunteer workers.\n\nCorrectional Services (to 1983)\n\nThe Correctional Services Division was responsible for the administration of the Victorian prison system and for developing alternatives to institutional care including community-based attendance centres. Its major functions were:\n control and supervision of all persons imprisoned or detained in prison\n administration of attendance centres as an alternative to imprisonment\n Court advisory services including pre-trial and pre-sentence reports\n assistance in the rehabilitation of all prisoners and persons released from prisons or police gaols\n provision of welfare services to prisoners and their families and the provision of prisoner support services such as education, prison industries and counselling for prisoners and their families\n assistance to and promotion of co-operation between organisations and Government Departments concerned with the welfare and after care of prisoners.\n\nThe provision of these services led to the development of two distinct programmes:\n\n Correctional (or Custodial) Services being the administration of the traditional prison system, such as had been undertaken by the former Prisons Division and\n Community Based Corrections being the administration of alternatives to prison detention such as attendance centres and community service orders.\n\nThe latter programme also encompassed correctional services provided by the Regional Services Division of the Department including probation, parole and community service orders.\n\nEstablishment of the Office of Corrections\n\nIn 1983 a major review of Victoria's prison system was undertaken by an American consultant J.D.Henderson and Commander P.H.Bennett of the Victoria Police. They concluded that the prison system was long overdue for redevelopment, and as a result the Office of Corrections (VA 1063) was established by an Order-in-Council gazetted on 17 August 1983.\n\nUnder the provisions of the Community Welfare Services (Director General of Corrections) Act 1983 (No.9966) the Office of Corrections was administratively separated from the Department of Community Welfare Services and the Director General assumed the powers of a Chief Administrator.\n\nThe Office of Corrections assumed responsibility for the administration of the prison system and for the provision of adult correctional services which compass custodial services and facilities and a range of non-custodial services including attendance centre orders, probation orders and community service orders, as well as the post-custodial, pre-release and parole programmes. The Office also provides pre-trial and pre-sentence advice to courts.\n\nResponsibility for juvenile correctional services and institutions remained with the Department of Community Welfare Services.\n\nEstablishment of the Department of Community Services\n\nIn 1985, following the appointment of a Minister for Community Services, a Department of Community Services (VA 2633) was established. The establishment of the new Department followed a major review and redefinition of many services which had traditionally been regarded as health services. In May 1985 the Department of Community Services became responsible for pre-school services which included the administration of the pre-school centres, child minding centres and services providing for the care of pre-school children.\n\nIn October 1985 the new Department of Community Services assumed responsibility for all community welfare programmes administered by the Department of Community Welfare Services and for domiciliary care services, family health services, physical and sensory disability services and intellectual disability services, all of which had previously been administered by the Health Department (VA 2695).\n\nFor further information about the administration of prisons and correctional services see VRG 9 Prisons and Youth Training Centres and VRG 93 Corrections.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nFor records of the Department of Community Welfare Services see List of Holdings 2nd edition 1985, section 3.5.1 (Department of Community Services). Researchers are also advised to consult sections 3.4.7 (Correctional Services), 3.4.8 (Adult Parole Board), 3.5.6 (Youth Parole Board), 8.0.0 (Health and Welfare Agencies), and 13.0.0 (Prisons and Youth Training Centres).

This occurred in accordance with the recommendations of the Committee of Inquiry into Hospital and Health Services in Victoria, whose report had been presented to the Minister of Health in July 1975.\n\nThe establishment of the Health Commission represented a major re-organisation of health services in Victoria and for the first time responsibility for the central administration of health services rested with a single agency. The Health Commission assumed responsibility for all functions previously administered by the Department of Health I (VA 695), the Mental Health Authority (VA 692), the Commission of Public Health (VA 694) and the Hospitals and Charities Commission (VA 693).\n\nMunicipalities (VRG 12) continued to have a significant role in the provision of health services.\n\nThe responsibilities of the Health Commission were initially administered by three divisions: Public Health Division, Hospitals Division and Mental Health Division. In 1981 a Mental Retardation Division was established assuming responsibility for programmes which had previously been the responsibility of the Mental Health Division.\n\nIn 1985 major changes in the administration and provision of health services were given effect by a series of Administrative Arrangement Orders, (numbers 30, 31, 36, 37, 41 and 42), amendments to the Public Service Act 1974 and the Health Amendment Act 1985 (No.10262). Many services which had been traditionally regarded as health services were redefined as community services and responsibility for these functions was transferred to the Department of Community Services (VA 2633).\n\nThe Department of Health II (commonly known as the Health Department) (VA 2695) was established by Order of the Governor in Council under the Public Service Act 1974 on 26 August 1985.

    "description": "Formation of District Road Boards was authorised under section 10 of An Act for Making and Improving Roads in the Colony of Victoria 1853 (16 Vic., No.40). Moorabbin was proclaimed a Road District on 5th of May 1862, notice of the proclamation appearing in the Victorian Government Gazette on 16th May 1862. The Moorabbin Road District incorporated portions of the parishes of Moorabbin and Mordialloc in the county of Bourke. The boundaries of Moorabbin Road District were altered by proclamation on 15th of May 1862, notice of which appeared in the Victorian Government Gazette on 23rd September 1862. Under the Local Government Act 1863, Road Districts could be divided into electoral subdivisions. Residents of the Moorabbin Road District petitioned the Governor to divide the Moorabbin Road District into three subdivisions in accordance with the Act, and the subdivisions were proclaimed by Order-in-Council on 14th November 1864. These three subdivisions consisted of the East Moorabbin Subdivision, West Moorabbin Subdivision, and North Moorabbin Subdivision. Notice of the proclamation and a description of the boundaries of each subdivision were proclaimed in the Government Gazette on 22nd November 1864.\n\nAfter the passing of the Shires Statute Amendment Act 1870 (34 Vic., No. 387), constituted Road Districts could become a Shire by Order-in-Council if the annual net value of rateable property appearing as general rates was at least twelve thousand pounds. Moorabbin Road District was proclaimed a Shire by Order-in-Council on 23rd of January 1871, notice of the proclamation appearing in the Victorian Government Gazette on 27th January 1871. Upon becoming a shire, the electoral divisions of the Moorabbin Road District became the ridings of the shire. Residents of the Shire petitioned the Governor in accordance with sections 16 and 35 of the Local Government Act 1915 (2686) to re-subdivide the Shire into four Ridings. The new subdivisions, which were proclaimed by Order-in-Council on 22nd May 1917, were North Riding, Moorabbin Riding, Cheltenham Riding, and South Riding. Notice of the new ridings, along with a description of the new boundaries, was published in the Government Gazette on 30th May 1917. After changes to the boundaries of the Shire resulted in the ridings being reduced to three, the Shire was re-subdivided again in 1929. The new ridings were Centre Riding, North Riding, Moorabbin Riding and Cheltenham Riding. Notification of the changes and a description of the new boundaries were published in the Government Gazette on 29th of May 1929.\n\nUnder the Local Government Act 1903 (3 Edw. VII. No. 1893), the Governor in Council could make Orders exercising their power to sever any portion of Victoria from one municipal district and annex it to another. Proclaimed orders were to take effect from the date of their publication in the Victorian Government Gazette. Residents wanting an area severed from its current municipal district compiled a petition to the Governor expressing their wishes. In accordance with the 1903 legislation, residents from the West Riding of Moorabbin petitioned to become part of the South Ward of the Town of Brighton (VA 573). The severance and annexation was proclaimed by Order-in-Council on 2nd April 1912, and published in the Victorian Government Gazette on 3rd April 1912. As a result of the severance, the boundaries of the Shire of Moorabbin and the Town of Brighton were redefined.\n\nFurther severances followed over the years. A second severance and resulting redefinition of boundaries was proclaimed on 26th of February 1917 when part of the South and West Ridings of the Shire of Moorabbin became the Borough of Sandringham. Notice of this was posted in the Victorian Government Gazette on 28th February 1917. An Order-in-Council proclaimed 18th of May 1920 severed part of the South and Cheltenham Ridings of the Moorabbin Shire to become the Borough of Mentone and Mordialloc (VA 4700). The remaining part of the South Riding was joined to the Cheltenham Riding. Notification of the alterations was published in the Government Gazette on 27th May 1920. A further section of Cheltenham Riding was severed and annexed to the Borough of Mentone and Mordialloc in accordance with an Order-in-Council dated 10th of May 1921, notification of which was published in the Government Gazette on 18th of May 1921. A section of Moorabbin Ward was severed and annexed to the City of Oakleigh (VA 871) by an Order-in-Council dated 26th of May 1959. Notice of this appeared in the Government Gazette on 27th of May 1959.\n\nUnder the Local Government Act 1928 (Act No. 3720) sections 16, 44 and 46 and the Local Government (Shire of Moorabbin) Act 1934 (Act No. 4217), the Governor in Council could proclaim a Shire to be a City upon receipt of a petition from the ratepayers of the Shire declaring that the annual revenue of the Shire exceeded twenty thousand pounds. Notification of the petition appeared in the Victorian Government Gazette on 5th of September 1934, which lead to the Shire formally being proclaimed a City by Order-in-Council on 9th of October 1934. Notification of the proclamation was published in the Victorian Government Gazette on 10th October 1934.\n\nThis council was abolished on the 15th of December 1994 as part of a state-wide program of local government reform enacted between 1993 and 1995. The reform process reduced the number of councils from 210 to 78 under the Local Government Act 1989.

    "description": "Establishment and Functions\n\nFollowing the achievement of responsible government in late 1855, Charles Pasley, previously the Colonial Engineer was appointed Commissioner of Public Works and became responsible for the co-ordination of all public works and for the administration of the Public Works Department, previously known as the Department of the Commissioner of Public Works.\n\nThe Public Works Department was responsible for public works and buildings (1855-1987), including property and accommodation management (to 1985), building and government accommodation services and supply of stores, furniture and equipment (to 1987); preservation of historic buildings (to 1973) and historic government buildings (to 1983); main roads and bridges (1877-1913); rural water supply (1860-1867); and Melbourne water supply and sewerage (1855-1891); local government (1855-1958); tourist resorts and facilities (?1922-1958); tourist roads; ports and harbours (1900-1983); including fisheries (1900-1910), aspects of immigration (1900-1923; 1927-1930); metropolitan foreshores (to 1956; 1974-1983), Alfred Graving Dock (1900-1917), marina permits (to 1987), wire netting advances (to 1928) and licences for the occupation of unused roads and water frontages (to 1928) and cemeteries (to 1873).\n\nIn 1987 one of the longest established departments was abolished when the newly appointed Minister for Housing and Construction (VRG 88) assumed responsibility for all major functions then under the administration of the Minister of Public Works and the Ministry of Housing and Construction (VA 2907) was established.\n\nEstablishment of the Board of Land and Works VA 744\n\nSome of the administrative difficulties which may have prompted the Government to establish the Board of Land and Works (VA 744) in 1857, were described in the \"Report from the Select Committee of the Legislative Council on Public Works\" in 1853/4. Papers Presented to Parliament 1853/4 Vol.3. The Select Committee had noted \"the want of co-operation between different departments; the loose mode of authorizing expenditure; the unsatisfactory manner of dealing with tenders and the delays in payments, all of which cause unnecessary waste of the Public Funds and enhance the cost of Public Works....\".\n\nThe former Colonial Architect, Henry Ginn, advocated the establishment of a Board consisting of the Surveyor-General, the Colonial Engineer and the Colonial Architect who would be jointly responsible for all public works. He recommended that the Board should be empowered to decide upon tenders; to consider the plans for proposed public works and buildings and to determine their location; and that once the work had been completed, the Board should inspect it and determine whether the design and specifications had been met.\n\nThe Government opted instead for the appointment of a Commissioner of Public Works who was to be responsible for the co-ordination of all Public Works from 1855.\n\nThe Board of Land and Works was established by statute in 1857 (An Act to establish a Board of Land and Works, No.31) because it was considered that the administration of public lands and public works would be more effectually and economically managed if they were consolidated and placed under one head. Under the provisions of the \"Act to establish a Board of Land and Works\", all powers previously vested in the Commissioner of Public Works and the Surveyor General were to be vested in the Board and Letters Patent dated 28 April 1857, formally abolished the two positions of Commissioner of Public Works and Surveyor General or Commissioner of Crown Lands and Survey.\n\nThe Departments of the Civil Service which were then under the respective control of those two positions together with the Central Roads Board (VA 2803) which was disbanded from 1 January 1858, were to be consolidated in the Board and effectively became sub-departments. While there was clearly an intent to achieve consolidation, the extent to which the sub-departments were administratively integrated following the establishment of the Board in 1857 is uncertain and from late 1858 and the re-appointment of a Commissioner of Public Works and a Commissioner of Crown Lands and Survey, the sub-departments are clearly administratively separate.\n\nThe Board was initially to consist of between three and five members. The only political member of the Board was to be the President and the Act specifically precluded the other members of the Board from being members of either the Legislative Council or the Legislative Assembly. The President and one other member constituted a quorum and the first four non-political members to be appointed to the Board were the Inspector General of Public Works and Railways; the Surveyor-General; the Commissioner of Roads and Bridges and the Engineer in Chief of Railways. (See supplemental Report of Civil Service Commission in Papers Presented Parliament 59/1859-1860 Vol.IV).\n\nIn June 1858 this arrangement was altered slightly to allow for a vice-president, who was also a Minister, to sit in the absence of the President. In December 1858 the Governor appointed Charles Gavan Duffy as Commissioner of Crown Lands and Survey and George Samuel Wegg Horne as Commissioner of Public Works apparently reviving the old ministerial offices. Yet although the positions were nominally the same and the incumbents were responsible ministers, the powers and duties of the previous positions had been vested in the Board of Land and Works by the 1857 Act. Statutory responsibility for the functions they administered remained with the Board until its abolition in 1964. By c1859/60 the Commissioner of Crown Lands and Survey and the Commissioner of Public Works acted as the President and Vice-President of the Board respectively. The Board was officially incorporated with a common seal in 1860 (Civil Service Commission 1859 Supplemental Report).\n\nOperation and Responsibilities of the Board of Land and Works\n\nAlthough one of the primary purposes in establishing the Board of Land and Works was to achieve a consolidation of the administration of all matters relating to public land and works under one head, this was quickly undermined by the manner in which the Board operated. A report of the Civil Service Commission of 1859/60 noted that \"... although the Board nominally remains, a return has practically been made to the former system of two separate departments, each under the direction of a Responsible Minister and each with its several sub-departments.\" At those meetings of the Board held to determine Land and Survey or Roads and Bridges matters the President (Commissioner of Crown Lands and Survey) presided, whilst the Vice-President (Commissioner of Public Works) sat as head of the Board when public works or railway matters were to be discussed.\n\nIn 1865 \"An Act to Amend and Consolidate the Laws Relating to Public Works\" (No.289) (referred to as the Public Works Statute) was passed. Section 12 listed the duties of the Board as \"... consider and determine all matters and questions relating to the adoption of any plans and specifications for public works and shall consider and deal with all requisitions for buildings, furniture, or repairs and shall decide upon the acceptance of all tenders for such works, buildings, furniture or repairs and the terms and conditions on which the same shall be accepted ... and all other matters and questions relating to or concerning the public lands, works and buildings of the colony.\" Together with its responsibility for public lands and works the Board was also responsible for overseeing the construction and maintenance of railways, sewerage works, domestic water supply works for both Melbourne and Geelong, and the electric telegraph lines. Such responsibility extended to the making of by-laws and the levying of tolls, etc. Although statutory responsibility for these functions was vested in the Board, operational responsibility was effectively exercised by various sub-departments of the Board including the Public Works Department (VA 669) and a number of these sub-departments became Departments of State on the abolition of the Board in 1964.\n\nUnder the provisions of the Public Lands and Works Act 1964 (No.7228) the Commissioner of Public Works became the Minister of Public Works in whom were vested the relevant statutory powers of the Board of Land and Works.\n\nPUBLIC WORKS AND BUILDINGS\n\nThe primary responsibility of the Public Works Department was the construction and maintenance of the colony's and later the State's public works and buildings. Prior to 1855, responsibility for these functions had been exercised by the Colonial Engineer and the Colonial Architect. For further information about the administration of public works in the period 1836-1855, see VRG 28 Public Works.\n\nAlthough research into the way in which the Department exercised its responsibility for public works and buildings is yet to be undertaken, it is clear that the civil establishment of the Department always included a very significant number of architects, engineers, draftsmen and inspectors who together were responsible for the design and construction of public buildings, the preparation of plans and specifications, the preparation of estimates for furniture and fittings and the supervision and inspection of all public works and buildings under construction.\n\nIt is also apparent that most of this work was undertaken by contractors but the role and responsibility of the Department in the letting and supervision of contracts is yet to be researched. Until 1964, statutory responsibility for the design, construction and maintenance of public buildings, the approval of plans and specifications, the consideration of tenders, the supervision of contracts and the approval of requisitions for buildings, furniture and repairs was vested in the Board of Land and Works (VA 744).\n\nTransfer of Public Buildings and Related Functions from the Public Works Department\n\nIn 1985 the Property and Services Division was transferred from the Public Works Department to the Department of Property and Services (VA 430). This Division was responsible for the purchase, acquisition, leasing and rental of properties for State government departments in accordance with the policies of the State Accommodation Committee and under the direction of the Victorian Public Offices Corporation. The Division was also responsible for the security of government property, the provision of janitorial services, and management of canteens, cafeterias, a light transport fleet and vehicle parking.\n\nIn 1987 a Ministry of Housing and Construction was established and assumed responsibility for the planning, design and construction of public buildings and the restoration and maintenance of existing buildings for the Government and agencies funded from the State budget; the supply of furniture, stores and equipment to government agencies; the fitout of government accommodation and the maintenance of air-conditioning in government buildings.\n\nROADS AND BRIDGES\n\nMain Roads and Bridges\n\nOn 1 September 1877, by Order of the Governor-in-Council, the administration of matters relating to roads and bridges was separated from the administration of railways and responsibility was assumed by the Roads and Bridges Branch of the Public Works Department (VA 669). Responsibility for main roads and bridges had previously been exercised by the Department of Roads and Bridges (VA 2964) from 1858 to 1871 and the Department of Railways and Roads (VA 2875) from 1871 to 1877.\n\nRes... truncated"

    "description": "Establishment of the Ministry of Transport\n\nThe Ministry of Transport was established by the Transport Act 1951 (No.5559) for the purpose of \"securing the improvement, development and better co-ordination of railway, tramway, road and air transport in Victoria\".\n\nAdministrative Arrangements 1951-1983\n\nInitially a Co-ordinator of Transport was appointed as the Ministry's permanent head, and while the Ministry could consist of specially appointed officers, the Minister was also empowered to make use of the services of any officer, employed by either the public service or by one of the authorities responsible for transport functions.\n\nThe provision of transport services between 1951 and 1983 has been the responsibility of a number of authorities, including:\n\n Victorian Railways (VA 2876) 1883-1983\n Railway Construction Branch, Board of Land and Works (VA 690) 1892-1964\n Railway Construction Board (VA 691) 1965-1980\n Railway Construction and Property Board (VA 615) 1980-1983\n Melbourne Underground Rail Loop Authority 1970-1983\n Melbourne and Metropolitan Tramways Board (VA 2694) 1919-1983\n Transport Regulation Board (VA 2738) 1933-1983\n Country Roads Board (VA 722) 1913-1983\n West Gate Bridge Authority 1966-1982\n Road Traffic and Safety Authority (VA 487) 1971-1983.\n\nResponsibility for co-ordinating road safety, traffic management, motor registration and driver licensing passed from the Ministry for Police and Emergency Services (VRG 73) to the Ministry of Transport in 1981.\n\nRestructure of Transport Administration 1983\n\nDuring 1982 and early 1983, the Ministry was restructured to enable it to operate as a corporate transport headquarters responsible for the performance of all Government transport activities, the better development of transport strategies and allocation of resources, the better co-ordination of loan-raising action, and the better management of existing finances.\n\nThe Transport Act 1983 (No.9921) which provided for these administrative changes also provided for a restructure of the transport authorities, creating four new authorities to replace the previous eight. From 1983 the Ministry therefore became responsible for the co-ordination, planning and resource management of transport services provided by:\n\n State Transport Authority trading as V/Line (VA 1038) which succeeded Victorian Railways and the Railway Construction and Property Board.\n Road Traffic Authority (VA 1036) which succeeded the Road Traffic and Safety Authority and the Transport Regulation Board.\n Metropolitan Transit Authority (VA 1044) which succeeded the Melbourne and Metropolitan Tramways Board and the Melbourne Underground Rail Loop Authority.\n Road Construction Authority (VA 1054) which succeeded the Country Roads Board which itself now included the Westgate Bridge Authority.\n\nThe Ministry also became responsible for the provision of specialist property and other services to these authorities.\n\nPorts and Harbours\n\nAlso in 1983 the Division of Ports and Harbours, which had previously operated in the Public Works Department (VA 669) was transferred to the Ministry of Transport. This Division was responsible for:\n\n control of port navigation and port development\n construction and maintenance of harbour and coastal works\n maintenance of shipping channels\n tidal surveys\n foreshore protection\n administration of Marine Board matters.\n\ncovering all the Victorian coastline except for those areas controlled by the Port of Melbourne (VA 1426), Port of Geelong (VA 1425) and Port of Portland Authorities VA 1427)\n\nOn 1 October 1986 the Ports and Harbours Division merged with Victoria's three Port Authorities. The Port of Melbourne Authority assumed responsibility for the administration and operation of ports along Victoria's eastern coast, including: Port of Western Port, Port of Anderson's Inlet, Port of Corner Inlet and Port Albert, Port of Gippsland Lakes, Port of Snowy River and Port of Mallacoota. In addition the Port of Melbourne Authority assumed responsibility for the maintenance and upgrading of navigational aids in all Victorian coastal waters, oil pollution control in all Victorian coastal waters, hydrographic surveying of Victorian ports and coastline, beach renourishment and the maintenance of recreational boating facilities along the eastern coast. The Port of Geelong Authority assumed responsibility for port and marine services along the coast from Cape Otway to the western side of Port Phillip Bay. The Port of Portland Authority assumed responsibility for the remainder of the western coast including Port Fairy and Warrnambool Harbour.\n\nFurther Restructuring 1989\n\nFurther alterations to transport legislation in 1989 under the Transport (Amendment) Act 1989 (No.44) reduced the number of authorities providing public transport services to two; the Roads Corporation (VA 2982) and the Public Transport Corporation (VA 2984). This legislation also gave the Director-General of Transport a formal role in overseeing and directing the operations of the two agencies, the predecessors of which had reported directly to the Minister for Transport.\n\nFollowing significant machinery of government changes after the re-election of the Kennett Government in April 1996 the Department of Transport was abolished. Under Administrative Arrangements Order No.150 all functions of the Department were transferred to the Department of Infrastructure (VA 3971).\n\nLocation of Records\n\nSee List of Holdings 2nd edition 1985, section 3.21.0.\n\nDEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORT VA 673\n\nMINISTER FOR PUBLIC TRANSPORT\nMINISTER FOR ROADS AND PORTS\n\nEstablishment\n\nFollowing significant machinery of government changes after the election of the first Kennett Government in October 1992, the Department of Transport was established by Administrative Arrangements Order No.114.\n\nFunctions\n\n Previous Ministry of Transport (VA 673);\n\n Ports and Transport Unit from the previous Department of Manufacturing and Industry Development (VA 3012).\n\nThe Department of Transport includes the Minister for Public Transport and the Minister for Roads and Ports and six agencies.

The declared intentions of the Agreement were to achieve greater uniformity in the law relating to companies and the regulation of the securities industry; to establish reciprocal arrangements and common standards and procedures; to co-ordinate the administration of the law relating to companies and thus avoid unnecessary duplication and to increase the protection afforded to the investing public. The government of each of the participating states argued that there should be uniformity in administration and reciprocal arrangements with respect to:\n\n incorporation of companies\n the regulation of the securities industry and trading in securities\n registration of prospectuses\n approval of trust deeds and trustees in relation to interests\n requirements relating to accounts and audit\n proclamation of companies as investment companies\n class and individual exemption powers relating to fund raising, etcetera, and to takeovers\n\nand such other matters relating to corporate affairs as the Ministerial Council from time to time designated.\n\nThe Agreement also made provision for the subsequent participation of other State or Territory Governments.\n\nIn Victoria the Agreement was given effect by the proclamation of the Companies (Interstate Corporate Affairs Commission) Act 1974 (No.8565) and under the provisions of this Act, the powers of the Registrar of Companies were transferred to the Commission for Corporate Affairs and the Companies Office (VA 2725) was renamed the Corporate Affairs Office (VA 679).\n\nThe Corporate Affairs Office is administered by the Commissioner for Corporate Affairs.

    "description": "Description\n\nThe Mildura Vineyards Protection Board was constituted under the Mildura Vineyards Protection Act 1918 (No. 2959), which came into force on 1 February 1919. The Mildura Vineyards Protection Act 1922 (No. 3229) extended the power of the Board to create by-laws. The Mildura Vineyards Protection Act 1931 (No. 3983) repealed the 1918 and 1922 Acts and dissolved the Mildura Vineyards Protection Board. Property and assets of the Board were to be liquidated and the funds paid towards the Mildura High School Scholarship Fund.\n\nSection 3 of the 1918 Act created a provisional Mildura Vineyards Protection Board, consisting of the councillors of the council of the Shire of Mildura. Under Section 4, the Governor in Council could create a vineyards protection district and board, upon petition by a majority of owners and occupiers of vineyards in any area within the Shire of Mildura. Regulations relating to the petition and election process for the boards were published in the Government Gazette of 12 November 1919 (pp. 2648-2650). As the Mildura Vineyards Protection Board was the only board dissolved under the 1931 Act, it is likely that it was the only board created under the Acts.\n\nThe provisional Mildura Vineyards Protection Board first met on 19 March 1919. At a meeting of the provisional Board on 5 May 1920, a petition was forwarded requesting that the Shire of Mildura be made a vineyards protection district, consisting of three divisions. The order constituting the District and Board was gazetted on 2 June 1920, to take effect from 31 July 1920. On 30 August 1920, nominations were received for election of the Board and the Board was appointed at a meeting on 14 September 1920.\n\nThe role of the Board was to protect vines within the Shire of Mildura from diseases, particularly the disease of the vines caused by the insect phylloxera rastatrix.\n\nThe Board had the power to:\nLevy an annual vineyards protection rate on occupiers or owners of vineyards within its district, based on the age of vines planted [S.5];\nLevy an annual charge on winemakers and distillers within its district [S.6];\nAppoint inspectors [S.10];\nMake by-laws [S.16];\nQuarantine areas and destroy vines [S.12];\nPay compensation for destruction of vines, gardens, orchards or produce [S.17];\nPropagate, sell and distribute phylloxera resistant vines, conduct research, and acquire or lease land for this purpose [S.25].\n\nAll monies received by the Board were to be paid into a vineyards protection fund, to be used for payment of compensation and expenses incurred in the work of the Board [S.8].\n\nAlthough there is no obvious reference to a formal reporting arrangement, it is likely that the Board reported to the Department of Agriculture. The Board corresponded with the Department on matters such as the creation of the Board (see minutes of 7 July 1920). The Board also had a close connection with the Mildura Shire Council. A brief history of the Board in the minutes of 9 August 1922 indicates that the Shire had been undertaking activities in relation to vineyards protection from about 1905, assisted by grants from the Department of Agriculture. The provisional Board consisted of the Shire councillors, and continued to meet in the Shire offices until at least 1923. Employees of the Board (for example, inspectors and rate collectors) are not listed in the Public Service List, but may have been employees of the Shire Council.\n\nAlthough legislation dissolving the Board came into effect in 1932, it is not clear whether the Board was active throughout the entire period from 1919 to 1932. Records held by the PRO indicate that the Board was active from 1919 until at least 1928. The financial year ending 30 September 1927 may have been the final year for which the vineyards protection rate was levied.\n\nLegislation\nMildura Vineyards Protection Act 1918 (No. 2959)\nAmended by the Mildura Vineyards Protection Act 1922 (No. 3229).\n\nAbolition\nRepealed by the Mildura Vineyards Protection Act 1931 (No. 3983) on 1 April 1932."

Subsequently, with effect from 16 April 2013, the Premier became responsible for administration of the Act specifically \"in so far as it relates to public records in the possession of, transferred from or to be transferred from Cabinet Secretariat\", and the Minister of the Arts for everything else (Table 2, Items 1 and 2). These changes took place in the context of machinery of government changes effected by the Coalition government following a change of Premier from the Hon Ted Baillieu MLA to the Hon Denis Napthine MLA (Victoria Government Gazette No. S 228, 25 June 2013).\n\nFollowing the November 2014 election and change of government, the Public Record Office remained responsible to the Premier for administration of the Public Records Act 1973 in relation to records of the Cabinet Secretariat. In relation to all other records, administration of the Act was removed from the portfolio of the Minister of the Arts and transferred to the Special Minister of State through Administrative Arrangements Order (No. 219) 2014, effective on 1 January 2015 (Victoria Government Gazette No. S 460, 24 December 2014).\n\nThe Public Record Office is the State's archives authority. It regulates the disposal and management of the records of government departments and authorities, the State's courts, municipalities, public schools, public hospitals and other public offices falling within the ambit of the Public Records Act 1973. It identifies records worthy of preservation as the archives of the State and makes arrangements for their preservation in perpetuity. It takes custody of records no longer required for current administrative purposes and provides access to records released for public inspection."

    "description": "The County Court of Victoria exercises civil and criminal jurisdictions. It also sits as an Appeal Court on appeals from the Magistrates' Courts and the Children's Court.\n\nA system of local County Courts was established in 1852 by Act 16 Victoria, No 11. The courts assumed the functions of the Courts of Request, which had operated in the period prior to separation from New South Wales. The act provided for courts - known as County Courts - to be established throughout the colony, with the power to hear civil matters where the amount of the claim did not exceed 50. The courts could hear matters exceeding this amount if both parties consented by written agreement, filed with the Registrar of the court, to give the court jurisdiction to hear the matter. The jurisdiction and organisation of the County Court has changed considerably over time. The jurisdictional monetary limit for civil claims, for example, is now unlimited in personal injury claims and $200,000 in other matters. In 1968 the County Court assumed the criminal jurisdiction previously exercised by the Court of General Sessions (refer VA 4204). This conferred power to hear criminal matters other than treason, murder, and certain murder-related matters.\n\nIn 1957, legislative provision was made for the system of local county courts to be abolished, and replaced with one county court, in and for the State of Victoria. When this change took effect in practice and what it involved is subject to further research. Whatever the case, County Court sittings continued to be held in various centres throughout the State.\n\nJurisdiction of the County Court as at September 2000:\n\nCivil:\n\nAt time of writing the County Court describes its civil jurisdictional limit as covering:\n\nAll claims for personal injuries, irrespective of the amount claimed.\n\nOther personal actions where the amount claimed does not exceed $200,000 (unless the parties consent in writing to exceeding that limit and which are not excluded from the County Court by the County Court Act or any other Act. If more than $200,000 is awarded, the plaintiff is entitled to recover the full amount.\n\nClaims against municipal councils for loss or injury sustained while upon or using roads, land, buildings, etc, under the control of the council or the municipality.\n\nActions where jurisdiction is specifically conferred on the County Court by a statute.\n\n['Jurisdiction of the County Court of Victoria', County Court of Victoria Internet site, September 2000]\n\nCriminal:\n\nAt time of writing, the County Court describes its criminal jurisdiction to cover:\n\n all indictable offences except treason, murder and certain other murder-related offences . Subject to the power of the Supreme Court to order transfer of a matter from the Supreme Court to the County Court, the Director of Public Prosecutions has the initial decision to present a person for trial in the County or Supreme Court . In practice, the great majority of offences save for treason or murder are heard in the County Court.\n\n['Jurisdiction of the County Court of Victoria', County Court of Victoria Internet site, September 2000]\n\n\nAppeals:\n\nAt time of writing, the County Court describes the appeals process as follows:\n\nAppeals go to the County Court from the Magistrates' Court under section 83 of the Magistrates' Court Act or the Children's Court in respect of criminal and quasi-criminal matters. Appeals are also heard from the Family division of the Children's Court.\n\nA decision of the County Court in its appellant jurisdiction is generally final. An exception occurs when the County Court substitutes a sentence of imprisonment for a non-custodial sentence. One can then, with the leave of the Supreme Court appeal against the sentence to the Court of Appeal.\n\n['Jurisdiction of the County Court of Victoria', County Court of Victoria Internet site, September 2000]"

    "title": "Railway Construction Branch, Board of Land and Works",
    "description": "Establishment of Railway Construction Branch\n\nThe Parliamentary Standing Committee on Railways presented its first report to the Legislative Assembly in 1891 and recommended that construction of railways be separate from the management of railway traffic and maintenance. From 1883 these functions had been the responsibility of the Victorian Railways Commissioners (VA 2876).\n\nAccordingly, under the provisions of the Railways Act (Amended Act) 1891 55Vic., No.1250 responsibility for the construction and completion of all lines of railway was vested in the Board of Land and Works (VA 744), to take effect from the 1 January 1892.\n\nThe agency responsible for railway construction subsequently became known as the Railway Construction Branch, Board of Land and Works. Also under the provisions of the Railways Act 1891, the Minister responsible for railways matters was deemed to be, ex officio, a Vice-President of the Board of Land and Works - a return to the situation which had existed prior to the transfer of the management of the railways to the Victorian Railways Commissioners in 1883-1884. Until 1934 a Minister of Railways was responsible, after which the title changed to Minister of Transport.\n\nRole of Board of Land and Works\n\nThe Act authorized the Board to accept contracts for works to be undertaken and determined that once a line became completed the responsibility of the Board would cease and responsibility would be assumed by the Victorian Railways Commissioners. The Commissioners retained responsibility for maintenance and supervision of lines of railway as well as the general management of railway services and traffic.\n\nThe 1891 Act also provided that the officers and employees of the Engineer-in -Chief's Branch of Victorian Railways be transferred to the employment of the Board of Land and Works.\n\nThis arrangement continued until 1964 when the Board of Land and Works (VA 744) was dissolved. Whereas most of the statutory responsibilities of the Board could be transferred to responsible Ministers this was not the case for the railway construction responsibilities of the Railway Construction Branch.\n\nTwo main problems existed. Firstly, as the staff had been employed by the Board of Land and Works as a statutory authority, and were therefore not subject to the Public Service Acts, a Minister could not become the 'employer' of such staff. Secondly, a Minister could not assume the Board's role in industrial awards. It was therefore necessary that the Minister responsible be removed from the administration of railway construction.\n\nEstablishment of Railway Construction Board 1964\n\nConsequently, under the provisions of the Public Lands and Works Act 1964 (No.7228), a Railway Construction Board (VA 691) was established on 1 January 1965, assuming responsibility for railway construction from the Railway Construction Branch, Board of Land and Works.\n\nThe end date of this agency has been artificially extended to allow the previous/subsequent relationship to be expressed on the database.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nSee List of Holdings 2nd edition 1985, section 3.21.0"

Following the proclamation of the Hospitals and Charities Act 1922 (No.3260) the Charities Board of Victoria (VA 2707) was established and responsibility for the administration of hospitals and charities was assumed by the Treasurer (VRG 23). In 1944, under the provisions of the Ministry of Health Act 1943 (No.4988) the Minister of Health (VRG 39) assumed responsibility for the Charities Board.\n\nEstablishment of the Hospitals and Charities Commission\n\nThe Hospitals and Charities Commission was established in 1948 under the provisions of the Hospitals and Charities Act 1948 (No.5300). The Commission assumed responsibility for functions previously administered by the Charities Board. The Commission consisted of three full time members appointed by the Governor-in-Council, of whom one was to be a person qualified in hospital administration.\n\nIn summary the functions for which the Commission was responsible were:\n\n establishment and management of public hospitals and later community health centres\n midwifery and infant care\n ambulance services\n recruitment, training and conditions of employment for nurses\n training of hospital administrators\n classification and training of medical staff\n registration and management of agencies providing residential care for the aged, the destitute, children, convalescent and chronically ill patients and physically or sensorily disabled persons.\n\nPowers and Responsibilities of the Hospitals and Charities Commission\n\nThe Hospitals and Charities Commission, like its predecessor, was responsible for determining what charitable relief was required to meet the needs of persons resident in Victoria and which institutions and benevolent societies should be subsidized. The Commission was also responsible for the financial administration of the Hospitals and Charities Fund and for the allocation of funds for salaries and expenses of the Commission and its officers and employees, for the establishment and maintenance of subsidized institutions and benevolent societies and for capital works and the purchase of equipment.\n\nThe Commission was responsible for the registration and inspection of hospitals and unsubsidized institutions and the administration and financial management of all subsidized institutions and benevolent societies. Under certain conditions the Commission could recommend the closure or amalgamation of subsidized institutions other than those run by religious denominations.\n\nThe Act required that institutions and benevolent societies other than those exempt from the provisions of the Act (see section 4) be registered with the Commission which was empowered to cancel or amend the registration of an institution. Unregistered institutions were not eligible to receive government funding and were prohibited from seeking voluntary contributions and no institution could be established without the prior consent of the Commission.\n\nOne of the major functions of the Commission was the co-ordination and rationalisation of hospital and institutional activities and it was empowered to make recommendations regarding the amendment of existing legislation and proposals for \"the improvement of and prevention of overlapping in, the administration of institutions and benevolent societies\" (section 18). The Commission exercised control over the allocation of funds and institutions were required to submit their budgets for approval. The Commission also exercised control over capital works and could determine the location and extent of all new buildings, the accommodation to be provided and the allocation of beds between , intermediate and public wards.\n\nThe Commission was also empowered to establish a bureau to assist in the admission of patients to hospitals and to furnish information in relation to nursing and hospital matters; to authorise or require the committee of management of any hospital to establish facilities for the care of convalescent or incurable persons and for persons suffering a chronic illness and to require hospitals to establish and maintain district nursing services and ambulance services. All ambulance services were to be registered and were subject to the supervision of the Commission.\n\nThe Commission, at the request of the Commission of Public Health (VA 694), could also arrange for the supervision of units established for the care of persons suffering from tuberculosis but the admission and treatment of patients remained the responsibility of the Commission of Public Health.\n\nThe Commission was required to promote and arrange for the collective buying of standard equipment, furnishings and supplies and it maintained an Equipment Section which assessed and made recommendations as to the purchase of major items of furniture and equipment. The collective purchasing of standard equipment was arranged through the Victorian Hospitals' Association, a non profit company in which the hospitals were shareholders.\n\nThe Commission was to establish a system of training for hospital administrators and in consultation with the Nurses Board to make provision for the training of nurses.\n\nThe Hospitals and Charities Act 1948 also provided for the incorporation and government of hospitals and philanthropic institutions, the liability of patients, the resumption of land for the benefit of an institution and the compensation of the owners of the land, and the regulation of fund raising activities.\n\nEstablishment of the Health Commission\n\nIn 1978, following the proclamation of the Health Commission Act 1977 (No.9023), the Health Commission of Victoria (VA 652) was established in accordance with the recommendations of the Committee of Inquiry into Hospital and Health Services in Victoria whose report had been presented to the Minister of Health (VRG 39) in July 1975.\n\nThe establishment of the Health Commission represented a major re-organisation of health services in Victoria and for the first time responsibility for the central administration of health services was vested in a single agency. The Health Commission assumed responsibility for all functions previously administered by the Department of Health I (VA 695), the Mental Health Authority (VA 692), the Commission of Public Health (VA 694) and the Hospitals and Charities Commission. The Health Commission Act 1977 also provided for the transfer to the Public Service of all staff previously employed by the Hospitals and Charities Commission.\n\nNOTE: For further information about the administration of health in Victoria for the period 1836 to 1989 see VRG 39 Health.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nFor records of the Hospitals and Charities Commission and its predecessor see also List of Holdings 2nd edition 1985, section 3.11.4.

    "description": "Background to Establishment of the Denominational School Board and the Board of National Education\n\nSchools in the Port Phillip District were not subject to direct Government administration until 1848 when the Government of New South Wales established the Denominational School Board (VA 703) and the Board of National Education (VA 920). Prior to that time financial assistance either in the form of masters' stipends or a subsidy in proportion to local contributions was granted to schools established by recognized religious denomination and some assistance was given to parents who could not afford to pay the school fees.\n\nIn 1844 a Select Committee of the Legislative Council was appointed \"to enquire and report upon the state of education in the Colony and to devise the means of placing the education of youth upon a basis suited to the wants and wishes of the community\".\n\nThe Committee was critical of the denominational system which it considered to be excessively costly and reported that it considered the present state of education in the Colony to be extremely deficient and that many children were receiving no education at all. The Committee recommended that one uniform system of education be established.\n\nAlthough the Legislative Council endorsed the report by a slim majority, Governor Gipps did not sanction the necessary appropriations to implement the Committee's recommendations since he believed that without the co-operation of the Ministers of religion who were opposed to the recommendations it would not be possible to establish a useful general system of education.\n\nBy 1847 however, the church authorities were prepared to accept the establishment of dual boards and systems in return for increased state aid. On 4 January 1848, a General Education Board was formed for the regulation and inspections of schools to be conducted under Lord Stanley's System ie. the Irish National System which had been established by Lord Stanley in his capacity as Chief Secretary for Ireland. This system provided for the non-sectarian education of children at locally administered schools which were responsible to a national board.\n\nEstablishment\n\nThe Denominational School Board was appointed in January 1848 \"for the temporal regulation and inspection of the respective Denominational schools of the Colony within the district of Port Phillip\" and was directed \"to draw up a code of regulations for the conduct and inspection of schools of the different denominations, the appointment and remuneration of school masters,... the system and extent of degree of education to be taught in the schools and the terms on which the children of paupers will be admitted - in fact all that relates to the fiscal and temporal part of education.\" (Colonial Secretary to Denominational School Board, 4 January 1848. Archives Office New South Wales).\n\nFunctions\n\nThe Board was responsible for the distribution of funds to denominational schools from an annual Parliamentary grant and a proportion of the Church and Schools Estates Revenue. On 11 February 1848 a Denominational School Board for the Port Phillip District was appointed. For a short period, following separation and prior to the establishment of the Board of National Education for the Colony of Victoria (also known as the National School Board) on 30 December 1851, the Denominational School Board was appointed to conduct business relating to National Schools.\n\nSelect Committee of Inquiry into Education 1851\n\nOn 8 July 1851 a Select Committee was appointed \"to enquire into and report upon the present systems of instruction of youth in this Colony, receiving support from the public revenue.....and to recommend, if found requisite, a plan of education better adapted to the wants of the Community.\" (See Votes and Proceedings of the Legislative Council, Session 1852-3). The Select Committee, whilst acknowledging the differences of opinion within the community and noting that the Denominational and the Irish National System were each supported by a large section of the community, declined to recommend that the separate systems be continued in their present form. They noted the problems caused by the rivalry and hostility around by the promoters of each of the two systems and the unnecessary costs involved in supporting a dual administration. Given the conflict of opinion, they considered that a mere amalgamation of the Boards was not feasible and recommended instead a scheme based on a plan of the Committee of Privy Council on Education be implemented.\n\nThe Committee advocated that the only requirements necessary to obtain support for a school be its efficiency in imparting sound literary and moral education and the absence of any rules requiring compulsory religious instruction. They recommended that all schools receiving assistance be known as public schools and that a single Board consisting of four laymen be appointed with responsibility for the administration of all matters connected with public instruction and the sole management of the funds allocated.\n\nThe recommendations of the Select Committee were not implemented, debate on the issue ensured for a further ten years and Victoria continued to have a dual system of publicly funded schools.\n\nCessation of the Denominational School Board\n\nThe National and Denominational School Boards were amalgamated to form the Board of Education (VA 713) in 1862 under the An Act for the better Maintenance and Establishment of Common Schools in Victoria 25 Vic.,No.149. This Act repealed An Act to incorporate the Board of Commissioners for National Education which had established the National School Board (VA 919) and all property previously vested in that Board was vested in the Board of Education. The Denominational School Board was dissolved, land and school buildings were to continue to be vested in the trustees who were also empowered to transfer them to the Board of Education or sell them and apply the proceeds to educational purposes. The personal property of the Denominational School Board was to be vested in the Board of Education.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nSee list below and List of Holdings 1985, section 3.8.3."

    "description": "Establishment and Function of Victorian Milk Board\n\nPrior to 1932 the liquid milk supply to Melbourne and other city markets was apparently via individual licensed dairies operating independently. However, the Milk Board Act 1932 made provision for the appointment of a Board for the purpose of reporting and making recommendations as to the regulation of milk supplies to the metropolis. It was also charged with the promotion of a better and more economic collection, transport, treatment and distribution of milk including the regulation of the price paid to producers and the prices paid by consumers.\n\nIt is not clear whether this Board was ever officially constituted as the Act was repealed and replaced by the Milk Board Act 1933. The new Act provided for the constitution of a Board consisting of three members, one of whom, the chairperson, had to have an expert knowledge of the business. The new Board had similar powers and duties as the previous. It also regulated minimum prices to be paid to farmers, defined specific servicing areas for dairies, cancelled dairy licences and approved milk supply contracts.\n\nIn 1936 an amending Act gave the Board the power to set wholesale milk prices at depots.\n\nThe system of supervised purchasing by dairies from farmers continued until 1951 when a further amending Act altered the system in that the Board purchased the milk from farmers then re-sold it to the dairies for sale and distribution. This further strengthened the contract system and allowed the Board to maintain the price paid to farmers.\n\nThe Victorian Dairy Industry Authority\n\nIn 1977 the Board was replaced by the Victorian Dairy Industry Authority.\n\nIts functions are to ensure that a sufficient supply of milk for human consumption and dairy produce of satisfactory standard is provided for all markets in Victoria and that all Victorian dairy farmers participate equitably in returns from the orderly marketing of such milk and dairy produce. It is also responsible for ensuring that milk production and manufacturing sectors of the Victorian Dairy Industry are integrated and rationalised and that national and export markets for Victorian milk and dairy products are developed to achieve optimum economy within the industry.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nSome records are held at the Public Record Office (see below)."

    "title": "Education Department",
    "description": "Prior to the appointment of a Minister of Public Instruction and the establishment of the Education Department in 1873 under the provisions of the Education Act 1872 (No.447), the administration of education and allocation of public funding had been the responsibility of the Chief Secretary (VRG 26) and the Board of Education (VA 713) which had been established in 1862. For further information about the education authorities prior to 1873 see VRG 35 Education.\n\nDuring the early history of the Education Department there is some confusion over the title of the office. It is variously referred to as the Department of Public Instruction, the Department of the Minister of Public Instruction or the Education Department. However, all letters, Government Gazette proclamations and annual reports, are registered under the title: Education Department.\n\nAn Overview of the Development of Education in Victoria\n\nEstablishment\n\nVictoria was the first of the colonies to introduce free, compulsory and secular education with the passing of the Education Act 1872 (No.447). School attendance increased by approximately fifty percent as soon as education became free and compulsory. This Act also ended financial aid to denominational (church) schools.\n\nThe Education Act was born out of dissatisfaction with the form and content of education as well as the controversy over religion and education. In September 1866 the Higginbotham Royal Commission recommended, inter alia, that a Minister of Public Instruction, responsible to Parliament, have a general superintendence over education in Victoria. Higginbotham introduced a Bill, based on his suggestions to Parliament in May 1867 but it received only a luke-warm response.\n\nIn 1869 the Eighth Report of the Board of Education stated that the Board was in favour of compulsory education. By 1870 two thirds of the population of Victoria aged between five and fifteen attended school. In August 1870 the Education Act (British) was passed and set up elementary schools in England although attendance there was not compulsory.\n\nIn December 1871 a Bill was introduced into Parliament by Sir James McCulloch for compulsory, though not free, education. This Bill proposed the abolition of aid to denominational schools. The Government collapsed in June 1872. In September 1872 the Attorney-General in the Francis Ministry, J.W. Stephen, introduced an Education Bill. It was passed in December 1872 and came into force on 1 January 1873. This Act abolished the Board of Education and established a Department of Education under a Minister of Public Instruction. The Department of Education controlled all aspects of State primary education. At the same time Church authorities responsible for the then existing Church Schools were permitted to, and did, retain an independent system, although State aid to these schools ceased in January 1874.\n\nThe Education Act provided for the establishment of a Department of Education consisting of a Secretary, an Inspector General, inspectors, teachers and such other officers as were deemed necessary. The Act provided that education should be full and secular and that school attendance was to be compulsory for children between the ages of six and fifteen. State schools were to be established wherever required and teachers became public servants. Religious instruction was not permitted during school hours and Boards of Advice were to be established as guardians of school property and were to induce parents to send their children to school.\n\nJames Wilberforce Stephen was the first Minister of Public Instruction, with the first Secretary, H.P. Venables, as the Permanent Head.\n\nRoyal Commissions between 1872 and 1901\n\nThe working of the 1872 Act was scrutinised by three Royal Commissions between 1872 and 1901. The Royal Commission of 1877 to 1878 under the direction of C.H. Pearson recommended minor additional duties for the Boards of Advice as well as other improvements to the education system. It had little immediate effect. The Commission of 1881 to 1884 under J.W. Rogers, and later J.M. Templeton, supported religious instruction of a non-sectarian nature in State schools. However, no legislation resulted from either Commission. In 1886 Pearson became the Minister for Public Instruction and could implement some of his suggestions of 1877 to 1878. The Education Act 1889 incorporated some of these changes, including the lowering of the school age to thirteen years and a provision for school instruction to cover lessons in temperance and health. The Education Act 1890 consolidated the law relating to education.\n\nIn 1891 the Education Department had ten administrative branches which operated under the Chief Clerk. They were Correspondence, Teachers, Buildings, Registration, Despatch, Papers, Books, Accounts, Messengers and Truant Officers Branch.\n\nThe Fink Royal Commission of 1899 to 1901, although ostensibly relating to Technical Education, made far-reaching recommendations affecting all levels of education. In terms of the administration of the Education Department, the Commission stressed that the Permanent Head should be an \"educationalist of high standing and administrative skill\" and recommended that the Inspector-General of Schools should be appointed to the office of the Secretary.\n\nThe Education Act 1901 introduced many changes based upon the recommendations of the Fink Commission. A Director of Education from the professional ranks of the Public Service was appointed with responsibility for the administration of the Acts, whilst the Office of Inspector-General was abolished. Mr Frank Tate was appointed as the first Director on 26 February, 1902. Teacher payment by results was also abolished under this Act.\n\nChanges Arising from the Education Act 1910\n\nThe next major administrative change resulted from the Education Act 1910. The Boards of Advice were abolished and school committees were set up to take their place. The office of the Secretary of Public Instruction was also abolished. Another change resultant from the Education Act 1910 was the establishment of the Council of Public Education (VA 2310) to replace the Teachers and Schools Registration Board (VA 2309) which had previously controlled the registration of non-Government schools and teachers. The functions of the new Council were to supervise employment and training of teachers, as well as to report to the Minister on matters related to the development and general administration of education. It also oversaw the standards of independent schools.\n\nThis Act also provided for the establishment of higher elementary schools and technical schools by the State, and so created two new administrative divisions. The first Chief Inspector of Technical Schools was appointed in 1911 and the first Chief Inspector of Secondary Schools was appointed in 1914. However, the original position of Chief Inspector (primary schools) seemed to involve some responsibility for all schools until 1925 when the office of Chief Inspector of Primary Schools was organised officially.\n\nThe structure of the Education Department remained relatively stable throughout the following three decades, except for the reappointment of a Secretary in 1920 to manage the administrative functions of the Department and the appointment of an Assistant Chief Inspector of Secondary Schools in 1937.\n\nAdministrative and Legislative Change 1940's to 1970's\n\nIn 1941 the Education Act was amended to protect children from expulsion on religious or political grounds and in 1943 the school leaving age was raised to fifteen years.\n\nIn 1949 the Minister of Education Act changed the title of Minister of Public Instruction to that of Minister of Education. The Education (Religious Instruction) Act 1950 provided for religious instruction in State schools, but it did not make it compulsory.\n\nThe 1960's saw several administrative changes within the Department. In 1964 the Primary Schools Division was divided into five areas - Northern, Southern, Eastern, South-Eastern and Western - all under Assistant Chief Inspectors who were in turn responsible to the Chief Inspector of Primary Schools.\n\nPursuant to the Education and Teaching Services Act 1967, the position of Director of Education became the Director-General of Education and in 1968 the Chief Inspectors became Directors of Education under the provisions of the Act. Two new Directorates were also established. These were for Teacher Education (under the Superintendent of Teacher Education since 1961) and Special Services which covered aspects ranging from physical education to welfare. The Curriculum Branch was one of five branches within the Special Services Division. This branch provided educational support services to all schools in the area of curriculum development and research. Within the branch specialised units were responsible for particular subjects and curriculum areas. The branch prepared proposals for curriculum change and course development, organised teacher in-service days and seminars and prepared research papers on educational issues.\n\nBy 1971 there was a Minister of Education, an Assistant Manager and a Director-General. Under them were three Assistant Directors-General - one of whom was the deputy to the Director-General; another was concerned with forward planning and survey and statistics, and the third looked after school buildings and educational facilities. There were also five Directors of Education encompassing the areas of Primary Education, Secondary Education, Technical Education, Teacher Education and Special Services. There was also a Secretary who controlled the thirteen administrative divisions - Accounts, Buildings, Estates, Examinations, General Correspondence, Inspection, Papers, Post Primary, Primary Teachers, Secretariat, Stores, Teacher Education and Transport.\n\nThe Director of Teacher Education was responsible for matters relating to studentships, the recruitment and in-service training of teachers and the administration of teachers' colleges. The Director of Special Services administered a variety of areas including schools for mentally and physically handicapped children and other specialist schools.\n\nThe Education (Handicapped Children) Act 1973 made provision for an increase in the number of Assistant Directors-General to four. The new position was for an Assistant Director-General of Special Education and Specialist Services. In 1975 the number of Assistant Directors-General was increased to five under the Education (Amendment) Act.\n\nThe Education (Minister of Special Education) Act 1976 made provision for the appointment of a Minister of Special Education who shared administrative responsibility with the Minister of Education until 1979 when this arrangement ended.\n\nReview and Restructure of Educational Administration in the 1980's\n\nFrom the mid 1970's and particularly during the 1980's the administration of education has been frequently reviewed and restructured. There have been many changes in policy and direction and several radical re-organisations of the Education Department and its schools.\n\nIn 1980 there was a Minister of Education, an Assistant Minister of Education, a Director-General, and five Assistant Directors-General - Personnel, Finance, Administration, Curriculum, and Buildings. Under them were nine Directors, each representing one of the nine divisions of the Education Department - Personnel, Teacher Education, Administrative Services, Special Services, Planning Services, Building Ope... truncated"

The Order was to take effect from the 30th of September 1964, except for the purposes of the first elections of councillors and related matters, which was to commence on the 29th of May 1964. Under the Act, the Governor-in-Council could exercise his powers to constitute as a shire any portion of Victoria containing rateable property capable of yielding a rate amounting to the net annual value of three thousand pounds. Orders-in-council constituting new shires were to assign the shire a name, describe the shire's boundaries, determine the number of council members and determine, name, and describe the subdivisions (if any) of the shire. A request was sent to the Governor-in-Council for the constitution of a new shire consisting of the North Ward of the City of Heidelberg (VA 444). A poll of the ratepayers was conducted, and as a result the request for the North Ward of the City of Heidelberg to become the new Shire of Diamond Valley was granted. The Shire was to be subdivided into four, consisting of the North, Central, South-East, and South-West Ridings. Notification of the constitution of the Shire of Diamond Valley was published in the Government Gazette on the 18th of March 1964.\n\nThe Diamond Valley Shire council was abolished on 15 December 1994 as part of a state wide program of local government reform enacted between 1993 and 1995. The reform process reduced the number of councils from 210 to 78. The Banyule City Council (VA 3670) has been appointed as the successor in law of the Shire of Diamond Valley and has assumed its rights, assets and liabilities. The area of Diamond Valley Shire was divided between several new councils. The Greensborough, Watsonia and Bundoora districts became part of Banyule City (VA 3670), and the Diamond Creek, Plenty and Yarrambat districts of the former Shire of Diamond Valley became part of Nillumbuk Shire (VA 3714)."

    "description": "Prior to the establishment of the Victorian Post-Secondary Education Commission (VPSEC) (VA 721) in 1978, there had been four distinct sectors of post-secondary education, each of which was administered by a separate co-ordinating body. While the Minister of Education was responsible for the administration of the legislation establishing each of the universities, each institution had considerable autonomy in the administration of its affairs and independent sources of funding. The universities were subject to the decisions of the Commonwealth Universities Commission, and from 1974, the Commonwealth Government assumed full responsibility for the funding of universities.\n\nThe Victorian Post-Secondary Education Commission (VPSEC) was set up as a statutory authority under the provisions of the Post-Secondary Education Act 1978 (no. 9145) which was proclaimed on 25 October 1978.\n\nInitially the Commission undertook a review of the recommendations contained in the report of the Committee of Inquiry into Post-Secondary Education (Partridge Committee), regarding the discontinuation of the separate administrations of the Victoria Institute of Colleges (VA 571) and the State College of Victoria (VA 437). Following receipt of submissions in 1979 and discussions with interested bodies, VPSEC recommended to the Minister of Education that the separate administrations of the Victoria Institute of Colleges (VIC) and the State College of Victoria (SCV) be discontinued.\n\nUnder the provisions of the Post-Secondary Education (Amendment) Act 1980 (No. 9424), VIC and SCV were abolished and their functions and assets were transferred to VPSEC.\n\nThe Victorian Post-Secondary Education Commission (VPSEC) was the premier decision making body responsible for the co-ordination of post-secondary education in Victoria. The commission provided:\n\n -advice to the Minister on all matters relating to higher education including funding -recommendations for the establishment of post-secondary education institutions\n -accreditation and reaccreditation of courses and the making of awards based on need, desirability and demand for a particular course, geographical location and resource capacity of individual institutions.\n\nIt was charged with the responsibility for negotiating these matters with the appropriate agencies, encouraging co-operation between post-secondary education institutions in relation to the offering of courses of study, the use of staff, equipment and facilities and other matters. By 1991 the Office of Higher Education provided assistance to VPSEC.\n\nOffice of Higher Education\nThe Office of Higher Education was established on 8 October 1991 by an Order in Council as a Admininstrative Unit under section 22 of the Public Service Act 1974, to provide administrative assistance to the Victorian Post-Secondary Education Commission. It was abolished in October 1992 in one of the many machinery of government changes made by the new government. Its functions were subsequently incorporated into a Higher Education Co-ordination Unit as part of the responsibilities of the Policy and Planning Division in the Office of the Secretary to the Department of Education.\n\nThe Tertiary Education Act 1993 repealed the Post-Secondary Education Act 1978, abolished VPSEC (VA 721) and made new arrangements for the promotion, development and co-ordination of higher education in Victoria. The section abolishing VPSEC was proclaimed on 7 June 1993 and the remainder on 1 July 1993."

    "description": "Background to Establishment of the Country Roads Board\n\nBy 1910 it had become increasingly apparent that there was a need for a central roads authority to take over responsibility from the Board of Lands and Works (VA 744) for the care and management of the main roads of the state. Up to this time there was a lack of co-operation between the agencies with operational responsibility for roads, the Roads and Bridges Branch of the Public Works Department (VA 669) and local municipalities, in the construction and maintenance of main roads. Expenditure of state funds was without proper supervision or a thorough investigation into actual needs. The absence of a systematic policy, as well as a lack of funds, had resulted in Victorian roads being in a deplorable condition. At this time the use of the motor car accentuated the demands for better roads.\n\nAs a result of these needs the Country Roads Act 1912 (No.2415) was proclaimed in 1913 providing for the establishment of the Country Roads Board as a central road authority with responsibility for those roads within the State considered to be main roads.\n\nFunctions of the Board\n\nInitial functions of the Board, as defined by the Act, were:\n - to ascertain which roads should be main roads,\n - to ascertain the most effective methods of road construction and maintenance,\n - to ascertain the deviations in existing roads or new roads which would facilitate communication and improve conditions for traffic.\n\nAfter an initial investigation by the Board construction guidelines were established and the letting of construction contracts, either directly by the Board or by municipal councils, proceeded by circa 1915.\n\nAlthough the Country Roads Board was established in 1913 to co-ordinate the construction and maintenance of main roads and bridges the Public Works Department (VA 669), through its Roads and Bridges Section, continued to have a role in the construction of roads and bridges. The final report of the Royal Commission on the State Public Service in 1917 indicates that the Public Works Department confined its operations chiefly to by-roads, tourist roads and special roads, although some overlapping with the Board could occur. The report, which made no mention of bridge construction by the Public Works Department, proposed the amalgamation of the Roads and Bridges Section with the Country Roads Board. It is not clear exactly when the Public Works Department ceased to exercise any responsibility for road construction. Therefore, despite the establishment of the Country Roads Board, the Board of Land and Works (VA 744) presumably continued to have some statutory responsibility for roads, and possibly bridges, until the Country Roads Board assumed full authority (by 1936?).\n\nExtensions of Responsibilities\n\nAt various times other types of roads were proclaimed under legislation and subsequently came within the responsibility of the Country Roads Board.\n\nThe Development Roads Act 1918 provided for the declaration of 'Developmental Roads', roads which would serve to develop any area of land by providing access to a railway station for primary producers.\n\nThe Highways and Vehicles Act 1924 provided for the declaration of certain arterial roads as State Highways.\n\nThe Tourists' Roads Act 1936 provided for the declaration of roads of sufficient interest or roads leading to tourist resorts or attractions as Tourists' Roads. Construction of tourists' roads had occurred prior to this on an ad hoc basis from at least 1917, through the Tourists' Resorts Committee which functioned within the Department of Public Works (VA 669), however no provisions had existed for maintenance or improvement prior to this Act. The Country Roads Board continued to have responsibility for tourists' roads until 1983 when it was succeeded by the Road Construction Authority (VA 1054).\n\nThe Country Roads Act 1956 enabled the Board to construct by-pass roads which became popularly known as freeways.\n\nThe Board also exercised some responsibility for other outer-metropolitan roads and, in conjunction with Municipal Councils, for unclassified roads. Other functions of the Board have included:\n - inspection and supervision of the construction and maintenance of country bridges,\n - control of speed and weight of commercial goods vehicles,\n - licensing of country, commercial, passenger vehicles including touring and light motor omnibuses and prescription of routes, under the Motor Omnibus Acts (until 1934 when the Transport Regulation Board (VA 2738) inherited this responsibility),\n - collecting on behalf of the Traffic Commission, a body made up of representatives of agencies concerned with traffic management, data on road safety and traffic accidents (until 1971 when this function was inherited by the Road Safety and Traffic Authority (VA 487)).\n\nFollowing an amendment to the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works Act in 1956 (No. 5982) the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works (VA 1007) was vested with responsibility for the construction and maintenance of proclaimed metropolitan bridges and main highways. In July 1974 the Country Roads Board resumed responsibility for such roads and bridges under the provisions of the Metropolitan Bridges Highways and Foreshores Act 1974.\n\nDecentralisation of Administration\n\nIncreases in the Board's direct responsibilities and the necessity for the supervision and control of works entrusted to municipalities led the Board in 1926 to adopt a scheme of decentralization. Over time the following ten regional divisions, each headed by a Divisional Engineer, were established: Bairnsdale, Ballarat, Benalla, Bendigo, Dandenong, Geelong, Horsham, Metropolitan, Traralgon and Warnambool. At present only the Ballarat Division has been registered (VA 1021).\n\nMinisterial Responsibility\n\nUntil 1970, the Country Roads Board reported directly to the Minister responsible for Public Works. On 12 June 1970 the Minister for Local Government assumed responsibility for the Country Roads Act, and from 19 May 1973 the Board reported to the Minister for Transport.\n\nRestructuring of Transport Portfolio and Abolition of the Board 1983\n\nIn 1982 the administration of the State's transport authorities began to undergo a significant transformation. Under the provisions of the West Gate Bridge Authority (Transfer of Functions) Act 1982, proclaimed on 1 July 1982, responsibility for the functions of the Westgate Bridge Authority were transferred to the Country Roads Board. The following year, on 30 June 1983, the Country Roads Board was succeeded by the Road Construction Authority (VA 1054) established under the provisions of the Transport Act 1983 (No.9921).\n\nFurther series may be listed in the List of Holdings (1985 edition, 1994 reprint)."

    "title": "State Rivers and Water Supply Commission (SRWSC)",
    "description": "Establishment\n\nThe State Rivers and Water Supply Commission was established by the Water Act 1905 and the first three Commissioners were appointed in May 1906: Stuart Murray, George Janson and William Cattanach (Victoria Government Gazette, 16 May 1906).\n\nBackground\n\nThe establishment of the Commission stemmed from a recognition that there was a need for a single, powerful and independent authority to coordinate and manage the State's rural water resources. The Water Act 1905 therefore vested overall responsibility for conservation and distribution of Victoria's rural water supplies for irrigation, industrial and urban purposes with the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission. The Victorian Water Supply Department's responsibilities relating to water and irrigation trusts, water rights and those operations it carried out for the Board of Land and Works (VA 744) under s.283-291 of the 1890 Act passed to the Commission. A few legislative provisions remained the responsibility of the Department's Chief Engineer (eg. reporting on viability of the proposed \"national works\" under s.293 of the 1890 Act), but these were removed by the Water Act 1909 which formally merged the Department and its remaining staff into the Commission (proclaimed 4 January 1910 - Gazette 19 January 1910, p.274). Stuart Murray, while still retaining the position of Chief Engineer of the Department, became the first Chairman of the Commission. In 1903 he was replaced as Chief Engineer and Chairman by Elwood Mead. The years 1906 - 1909 saw a gradual scaling down of the activities of the Victorian Water Supply Department (VA 2787) and transfer of its staff to the new Commission.\n\nResponsibilities and Functions\n\nThe main responsibilities of the Commission were:\n\n provision of advice about rural water resources and management to the Minister, landowners, and client groups\n surveying, gauging and reporting on surface water resources\n investigation, construction and management of water supply and drainage schemes for domestic, stock, industry and irrigation purposes\n oversight of local water, irrigation, sewerage, drainage and river improvement authorities\n flood plain management, flood protection and reclamation schemes\n river improvements, stream management and conservation, salinity and water quality control\n utilisation and conservation of underground water resources\n licensing of diversion of surface and underground waters.\n\nThe Commission also acted as the delegated authority of the Environment Protection Authority from 1973 with respect to water pollution in rural areas, and had certain responsibilities relating to soil conservation. In the periods of closer settlement following the First and Second World Wars, the Commission had responsibilities for a number of settlements in the irrigation areas. From 1969, under the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission (Special Projects) Act, it was empowered to provide consulting services outside Victoria.\n\nHistory of Functions: 1905 and 1909 Water Acts\n\nThe 1905 Act vested in the Commission statutory responsibility for:\n\n surveys of available water resources and planning for their storage and utilisation\n oversight of local water, sewerage and irrigation authorities, including administration of loans\n gauging of rivers and streams and reporting on results\n boring and exploration for underground water\n ownership and management of proclaimed \"national works\" (water works of State-wide significance).\n\nThe Board of Land and Works (VA 744) continued to have statutory responsibility for construction of \"national works\", although the actual construction was managed by the Commission. Statutory responsibility for construction was transferred to the Commission by the Water Act 1909.\n\nOversight of Local Authorities\n\nThe 1905 Act reconstituted local water, sewerage and irrigation authorities, bringing them under the Commission's general jurisdiction. Rural water supply, sewerage and irrigation schemes continued to be directly managed by a variety of local authorities, including municipalities; mostly constituted under the Water Act, but some with their own legislation. From 1958 sewerage authorities were constituted under the Sewerage Districts Act. Increasingly, the Commission took responsibility for construction of waterworks, while local authorities were responsible for reticulation, management and distribution. In January 1984, under the Water and Sewerage Authorities (Restructuring) Act and Water (Amendment) Act 1983, responsibility for the oversight of local authorities passed to the Ministry of Water Resources and Water Supply (VA 641), and the Local Authorities Division of the Commission was transferred to the Ministry.\n\nWater Works and Supply Schemes\n\nIn addition to its responsibilities for construction of water works and oversight of local authorities, the Commission itself directly managed water supply schemes in a growing number of rural areas. These schemes included a number of large urban supplies. Originally the Commission took over responsibility for the Coliban (Bendigo - Castlemaine) and Geelong schemes from the Victorian Water Supply Department (VA 2787). It later took on other urban schemes, including the Mornington Peninsula, Bellarine and Otways systems. From 1915 the Commission became the authority for building and maintaining water works in Victoria under the River Murray Waters Agreement.\n\nRiver Improvement Schemes\n\nFollowing a Parliamentary Public Works Committee of Inquiry in 1945, the Commission took on additional responsibilities for river management and improvement together with the oversight of local River Improvement Trusts (Victorian Yearbook 1984, p.299).\n\nGroundwater\n\nThe Groundwater Act 1969 vested in the Commission responsibility for the utilisation and conservation of groundwater. The Act was jointly administered with the Department of Minerals and Energy (VA 611) which was responsible for exploration and investigation.\n\nSoil Conservation\n\nThe Minister for Water Supply and the Commission were early sponsors of soil conservation in Victoria because of their growing concern with sand-drifts in the Wimmera-Mallee. A bye-law, incorporated in amendments to the Water Act 1942, enabled the Commission to control cultivation of land subject to drift near water channels. The Minister was a sponsor of the Soil Conservation Act 1940 which established the Soil Conservation Board. The Soil Conservation and Land Utilisation Act 1947 established the Land Utilisation Council to advise on land use in catchment areas and the Council included Commission representation (Victorian Yearbook 1984 p.288-289).\n\nCloser Settlement\n\nThe Closer Settlement Act 1912 (No.2438) transferred the control and administration of land suitable for settlement only under irrigation conditions or situated within an Irrigation and Water Supply District to the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission from the Closer Settlement Board (VA 2266). The Commission thus acquired the power to purchase, dispose and administer lands in accordance with the general provisions of the Closer Settlement Acts, subject to the decision of the Minister responsible for the Acts.\n\nUnder the provision of s.2 of the Discharged Soldier's Settlement Act 1917 (No.2916) the Commission was granted the control and administration of the settlement of returned servicemen and women on irrigable land.\n\nThe provisions of the Empire Settlement Act 1922 encouraged approved British immigrants to migrate to Australia for the purpose of land settlement or to augment the labour force. Subject to the Commonwealth and State Agreement of 1922, the Commission had responsibility for the control and administration of the settlement of assisted British immigrants on irrigable land.\n\nIn 1932 under the provisions of the Closer Settlement Act (No.4091) the newly appointed Closer Settlement Commission (VA 2268) assumed the powers and obligations of the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission in respect of the settlement and occupation of irrigable lands.\n\nIn the post second World War period, closer settlement in irrigation areas was managed jointly by the Commission and the Soldier Settlement Commission (VA 2270) (subsequently, Rural Finance and Settlement Commission (VA 2273), then Rural Finance Commission). The areas involved were the Murray Valley, Robinvale, Nambroh-Denison and Macalister (Victorian Yearbook, 1984 p.287-288). The work was undertaken by the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission on behalf of the Soldier Settlement Commission under the provisions of the Soldier Settlement Act 1946, s.11(2).\n\nOrganisational Structure\n\nInitially the Commission operated outside the public service. However, in 1939 following a Royal Commission in 1936, officers of the Commission were brought into the public service under the Public Service (Transfer of Officers) Act 1937. From 1939 the Commission was deemed to be the \"Department of Water Supply\" for the purposes of the Public Service Act, and its Chairman the permanent head of the Department. (It should be noted that the \"Department of Water Supply\" in all other respects did not exist.) This situation continued, even following the Water Resources Act 1975 which established a Ministry of Water Resources and Water Supply (VA 641). Thereafter until 1983 the Chairman was deemed to be the permanent head of the Ministry for the purposes of the Public Service Act.\n\nRole in Water Resources Council\n\nThe Council, established by the Water Resources Act 1975, advised the Minister on water resources, drainage and sewerage matters. All three State Rivers and Water Supply Commissioners were members of the Council.\n\nAbolition of Commission\n\nThe Commission was abolished by the Water (Central Management Restructuring) Act 1984 (s.14), its major powers, responsibilities and assets passing to the Rural Water Commission (VA 2338) on 1 July 1985. Its responsibilities for rural water resource policy were taken on by the new department of Water Resources (VA 2354). The Commissioners held their last meeting on 25 June 1984 (Victoria Government Gazette No.67, 20 June 1984, p.2005; Order-in-Council of 19 June amending Schedule Two of the Public Service Act 1984). Prior to its abolition, responsibility for oversight of local water and sewerage authorities had passed to the Ministry of Water Resources and Water Supply (VA 641) on 1 January 1984 under the Water and Sewerage Authorities (Restructuring) Act 1983.\n\nThe restructuring followed a review by the Public Bodies Review Committee of Victoria's non-metropolitan water industry (see 2 April 1980 reference from Parliament in Victoria Government Gazette No. 42, 20 May 1981, p.1594, and the Committee's Reports to Parliament, Nos.1-8, in particular Eighth Report, Future Structures for Water Management, Vol 3, Final Report: The Central and Regional Management of the Water Industry)."

    "description": "Background to Formation of the Victoria Police Force\n\nThe first police force in Victoria comprised the constabulary attached to the Police Magistrates, the first District Constable being appointed in September 1836 (New South Wales Government Gazette 14 September 1836). From 1837 to 1853, in addition to the local District and Rural Constabulary, there were a number of separate police forces, including the Melbourne City Police, Border Police, Mounted Police, Water Police, Native Police, Gold Escort and Goldfields Police (see VRG 10 for more details about the 1836-1853 period).\n\nIn 1853, following a Legislative Council Select Committee inquiry, a single integrated Victoria Police Force (VA 724) was established under the control of the Chief Commissioner of Police.\n\nAs the Victoria Police Force (VA 724) includes the Office of the Chief Commissioner of Police which performs a central management and administration role for the Force, the Victoria Police Force has been included in VRG 16 Colonial Secretary, VRG 26 Chief Secretary and VRG 73 Police and Emergency Services. It has also been included in VRG 10 Police in relation to its operational role.\n\nFormation and Operation of the Victoria Police Force From 1853\n\nA Legislative Council Select Committee on Police reported in 1852 that the existing police forces were \"insufficient in numerical strength - deficient in organisation and arrangement - and utterly inadequate to meet the present requirements of the country.\" It recommended their replacement with a single unified force and the division of the colony into a number of uniformly administered police districts (see Report from the Select Committee on Police to the Legislative Council 1852, Votes and Proceedings 1852-3, Volume 2).\n\nFollowing the recommendations of the Select Committee, a single integrated Victoria Police Force (VA 724) was formed by the Police Regulation Act 1853 16 Vic.,No.24 and placed under the control of a Chief Commissioner of Police. The existing forces, with the exception of the Water Police and the Detective Force, a branch of the Melbourne City Police, which continued to function within the Victoria Police Force, were disbanded, but many of their members were absorbed into the new Force. From 1853 a Victoria Police Gazette has been published weekly and in 1856 the first Manual of Police Regulations was issued.\n\nIn regard to its general law enforcement and policing duties the Victoria Police has operated since 1853 on a District basis with the Colony, and later the State, divided into a number of metropolitan and country Districts with further sub-divisions down to local police station and police office level. These regional arrangements have gone through a number of restructures. Initially there were nine police Districts, but these were increased to eleven following the 1881 Royal Commission. By 1971 there were nineteen Districts, seven metropolitan and twelve country, further divided into Divisions, then Sub-Districts. Recent restructures have resulted in the formation of large Regional Offices. District boundaries are detailed in the Gazettes.\n\nThe position of Chief Commissioner was also established by the 1853 Police Regulation Act. The Office of the Chief Commissioner provides central control, supervision, administration and co-ordination for the Victoria Police Force, its members and its operations. The Chief Commissioner has been responsible to the Colonial Secretary from 1853 to 1855 (VRG 16), the Chief Secretary from 1855 to 1979 (VRG 26) and most recently the Minister for Police and Emergency Services (VRG 73). Administrative assistance has been provided to the Force by Victoria Police and Public Service officers. Prior to the establishment of the Ministry for Police and Emergency Services (VA 421), the public servants belonged to the Police Branch or Police Department of the Chief Secretary's Department (VA 475). They now belong to an Administration section within the Office of the Chief Commissioner. Currently (1989) the Chief Commissioner's central police administration is divided into the following sections, each headed by an Assistant Commissioner - Crime, Operations, Traffic, Services, Personnel, and Research and Development. In addition to these regional and central management structures, a number of specialist areas have developed within the Force.\n\nCriminal Investigation\n\nCriminal detection or investigation was from the beginning the responsibility of the Detective Force which was reorganised into the Criminal Investigation Branch (CIB) following the 1881 Royal Commission. The Special Branch was formed within the CIB in 1931 with close links to the then Commonwealth Security Service (later Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation - ASIO), while in 1953 an Information Section/Bureau and in 1936 a Fingerprint Branch/Bureau were added. Until 1936 the CIB operated from the Melbourne District, but thereafter it was decentralised into eight Metropolitan Divisions. In 1948 it was further regionalised into twenty four Metropolitan and fifteen Country CIB Divisions. Other specialised sections and squads were added to it over the years - the Victorian Police Scientific Section and Detective Training School in 1938, the Homicide Squad in 1943, and more recently the Company Fraud Squad, Armed Robbery Squad, Arson Squad and so on.\n\nOther Specialist Sections\n\nOther special purpose units have also emerged, including the Licensing and Gaming Squads, Public Relations Office (1946), the Forensic Science Laboratory (established in 1955), the Police Surgeon (1947), the Motor Boating Squad (1964), the Dog Squad, Police Air Wing and Community Policing Squad. D24 was established in 1939 as the Force's Communication Control Centre.\n\nRole in Times of Emergency\n\nDuring the World Wars, the Force took on extra functions under wartime emergency legislation. From 1939 to 1945 D24 became a vital civil defence communications and air raid warnings centre with close ties to the military police organisations. Police also controlled lighthouses and Special Branch took on responsibilities for enforcing national security regulations. After World War II the police continued to be responsible for coordinating emergency services in an emergency until this role was assumed directly by the Minister for Police and Emergency Services following the 1982 Ash Wednesday bushfires. D24 continues to provide the State co-ordinating centre in an emergency.\n\nRoyal Commissions and Inquiries\n\nA series of inquiries and Royal Commissions have been held into police administration and operations (see also VRG 14 Royal Commissions and Boards of Inquiry). These have included a Commission of Inquiry appointed after the Eureka incident in 1854, a Parliamentary Select Committee in 1862, a Royal Commission following the Kelly Outbreak in 1881, further Royal Commissions in 1906, 1923 (following the Police Strike) and 1936, the Abortion Inquiry in 1970 and the Beach Inquiry in 1975 (see the Bibliography \"Victoria Police Reading and Study Guide\" in Police Life, November-December 1982, for a listing of published reports). The recommendations of these inquiries and Commissions - and of Colonel Sir Eric St. Johnston in his 1971 Report - resulted in various organisational changes, restructuring, reforms and innovations, for example formal training for recruits was introduced following the 1906 Royal Commission; significant pension reforms after 1923; a major restructure, establishment of the Internal Investigations Unit, and an opening up of career opportunities for women after the St. Johnston Report in 1971.\n\nWomen in the Victoria Police\n\nWomen first joined the Victoria Police Force in 1917 when two women were appointed as \"agents\" - they received half the pay of policemen and did not have the constable's power of arrest. In 1924 the four women police agents were reappointed with full constabulary powers, the same wages, hours and pension rights as policemen. By 1942 there were twelve policewomen and by 1950 eighteen. Their work tended to be restricted to law enforcement in areas such as neglected children, control of prostitution and abortion. In 1950 the first woman was appointed to the Criminal Investigation Branch, and in 1954 the first woman was appointed to the rank of sergeant. By 1956 there were forty three policewomen and by the early 1970's one hundred and eighty five.\n\nFrom the 1960's the traditional roles of policewomen were challenged and from the beginning of the 1970's policewomen began to be integrated into all aspects of policing and specialist duties.\n\nTraffic Control, Motor Registration and Driver Licensing\n\nFrom the early 1900's, police duties included traffic control at intersections. The Motor Police, equipped with bicycles, was formed in 1912 with duties including motor registration and driver licensing. By 1921 the Traffic Control Branch (from 1971 Traffic Department) and Motor Registration Branch (VA 488) had been established. The role of the police in road safety and traffic operations, and of the Motor Registration Branch were set down in a series of Transport, Transport Regulation, Road Traffic and Motor Registration Acts. From the mid 1950's their responsibilities for road safety and traffic control were greatly increased and a prevention and educational role emerged. The Road Courtesy and Accident Appreciation/Investigation Squads date from this period. In 1978 the operational wing of the Traffic Department, the Traffic Operations Group (formerly the Mobile Traffic Section) was regionalised.\n\nFurther research is needed to establish the varying roles of Victoria Police units and the Transport agencies involved in traffic management, and the type of coordination mechanisms in place. (See also VRG 49 Transport.)\n\nResponsibility for motor registration and driver licensing passed to the Minister of Transport (VRG 49) and Transport Regulation Board (VA 2738) in 1981 under the Motor Registration Act 1980.\n\nNeglected and Abused Children\n\nUnder the provisions of the Infant Life Protection Act 1890 the Chief Commissioner of Police was vested in 1890 with responsibility for the registration of homes used for the purpose of nursing, maintaining and adopting infants. This function was previously undertaken by local councils in their capacity as Local Boards of Health (see VRG 8 Health and Welfare Institutions and VRG 12 Municipalities). In 1907 a subsequent Infant Life Protection Act 1907 transferred responsibility for this function to the Department for Neglected Children, later known as the Children's Welfare Department (VA 1467) in the Chief Secretary's Department (see also VRG 26 and VA 475).\n\nIn addition to its related law enforcement and criminal investigation responsibilities, the Victoria Police Force has continued to play a support role to the agencies with responsibilities for neglected and abused children, increasingly in community education and preventive programs.\n\nSources\n\nSources used in compiling this Agency description include the official Victoria Police Force history: Police in Victoria 1836 - 1980 (Victoria Police Force 1980). A useful bibliography, titled \"Victoria Police: Reading and Study Guide\", was published in the Victoria Police Force magazine Police Life, November-December 1982.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nSignificant records are held by the Public Record Office. Researchers should also consult sections of the Summary Guide on the related Groups and Agencies referred to above.\n\nSee list below and List o... truncated"

    "title": "Board of Land and Works",
    "description": "Introduction\n\nThe Board of Land and Works was established in 1857 and abolished in 1964. Throughout its existence, the Board was responsible for matters relating to public works and public lands. It was also responsible for railways from 1857 to 1884 and again from 1892 to 1964; for main roads and bridges from 1858 until 1913; for Melbourne sewerage and water supply from 1859 to 1890; for rural water supply from c1860 until 1910; for aboriginal welfare from 1857 until 1860 and for local government from 1857 to 1958. Although statutory responsibility for these functions was vested in the Board, operational responsibility was effectively exercised by the various sub-departments of the Board, a number of which became Departments of State on the abolition of the Board in 1964.\n\nHistorical Context\n\nIn Britain a common feature of eighteenth and nineteenth government had been the vesting of responsibility for administrative functions in boards and commissions which were largely independent of Parliament.\n\nGovernors of Australian Colonies used administrative forms with which they and the Colonial Office were familiar and hence when the growth of colonial administration made it impossible for Governors to maintain direct control of all facets of administration, Boards were established. This pattern continued long after the achievement of responsible government in each of the colonies.\n\nFrom the mid nineteenth century, members of Parliament were often appointed as unpaid board members, and boards so constituted were sometimes seen as being an administrative form part way between the non responsible Board and the fully responsible ministerial department. Where, as in the case of the Board of Land and Works, the parliamentarians on the Board qualified for appointment by virtue of their being members of Cabinet, the result was much closer government control.\n\nAnother explanation advanced for the establishment of boards was that they provided a convenient form for the separate legal incorporation of certain government activities. The conferring of separate legal identity enabled them to sue and be sued without the usual complications associated with litigation involving the Crown.\n\nThe Board of Land and Works, created in 1857 was incorporated two years later.\n\nSome of the administrative difficulties which may have prompted the Government to establish the Board of Land and Works in 1857, were described in the Report from the Select Committee of the Legislative Council on Public Works in 1853/4. The Select Committee had noted \"the want of co-operation between different departments; the loose mode of authorizing expenditure; the unsatisfactory manner of dealing with tenders and the delays in payments, all of which cause unnecessary waste of the Public Funds and enhance the cost of Public Works....\".\n\nWhen giving evidence on these matters, Henry Ginn, the former Colonial Architect, in response to a question seeking his views on the best mode of carrying on public works, replied \"... I am most clear that it should be by a Board composed of those professional men who would afterwards have the carrying out of the works fixed upon. The Board should consist of the Surveyor General, the Colonial Engineer and the Colonial Architect. Thus when the Surveyor General was about to lay out a new township, he would have the advantage of consulting the Colonial Engineer on the subject of roads, bridges etc. and with the Colonial Architect as to the necessary buildings and the most convenient site for them\". Henry Ginn also recommended that the Board should be empowered to decide upon tenders; to consider the plans for proposed public works and buildings and to determine their location; and that once the work had been completed, the Board should inspect it and determine whether the design and specifications had been met.\n\nThe Government opted instead for the appointment of a Commissioner of Public Works who was to be responsible for the co-ordination of all Public Works from 1855.\n\nBOARD OF LAND AND WORKS - ADMINISTRATIVE HISTORY\n\nEstablishment\n\nThe Board of Land and Works was established by statute in 1857 because it was considered that the administration of public lands and public works would be more effectually and economically managed if they were consolidated and placed under one head. Under the provisions of the Act to establish a Board of Land and Works 1857 (No.31), all powers previously vested in the Commissioner of Public Works and the Surveyor General were to be vested in the Board and Letters Patent dated 28 April 1857, formally abolished the two positions of Commissioner of Public Works and Surveyor General or Commissioner of Crown Lands and Survey.\n\nThe Departments of the Civil Service which were then under the respective control of those two positions, together with the Central Roads Board which was disbanded from 1 January 1858, were to be consolidated in the Board and effectively became sub-departments. While there was clearly an intent to achieve consolidation, the extent to which the sub-departments were administratively integrated following the establishment of the Board in 1857 is uncertain and from late 1858 and the re-appointment of a Commissioner of Public Works and a Commissioner of Crown Lands and Survey, the sub-departments are clearly administratively separate.\n\nThe Board was initially to consist of between three (3) and five (5) members. The only political member of the Board was to be the President and the Act specifically precluded the other members of the Board from being members of either the Legislative Council or the Legislative Assembly. The President and one other member constituted a quorum and the first four non-political members to be appointed to the Board were the Inspector General of Public Works and Railways; the Surveyor-General; the Commissioner of Roads and Bridges and the Engineer in Chief of Railways.\n\nIn June 1858 this arrangement was altered slightly to allow for a vice-president, who was also a Minister, to sit in the absence of the President. In December 1858 the Governor appointed Charles Gavan Duffy as Commissioner of Crown Lands and Survey and George Samuel Wegg Horne as Commissioner of Public Works apparently reviving the old ministerial offices. Yet although the positions were nominally the same and the incumbents were responsible ministers, the powers and duties of the previous positions had been vested in the Board of Land and Works by the 1857 Act. It therefore appears that the ministerial positions were revived, but as officers under the jurisdiction of the Board rather than as independent positions. By c1859/60 the Commissioner of Crown Lands and Survey and the Commissioner of Public Works acted as the President and Vice-President of the Board respectively. The Board was officially incorporated with a common seal in 1860 (Civil Service Commission 1859 Supplemental Report, Papers Presented to Parliament, 59/1859-60 Vol IV).\n\nOperation\n\nAlthough one of the primary purposes in establishing the Board of Land and Works was to achieve a consolidation of the administration of all matters relating to public land and works under one head, this was quickly undermined by the manner in which the Board operated. A report of the Civil Service Commission of 1859/60 noted that \"... although the Board nominally remains, a return has practically been made to the former system of two separate departments, each under the direction of a Responsible Minister and each with its several sub-departments.\" At those meetings of the Board held to determine land and survey or roads and bridges matters the President (Commissioner of Crown Lands and Survey) presided, whilst the Vice-President (Commissioner of Public Works) sat as head of the Board when public works or railway matters were to be discussed. The Board was thus effectively divided into two parts and managed by two Ministers of equal rank. The Civil Service Commission was of the view that in reality the Board had become simply a Board of Advice to the two Ministers that presided over it. However the Commission was also of the opinion that though the intention of the Act was not being fulfilled, the operation of the Board should be endorsed because it gave rise to a system of consultation between officers within each of the departments and between the departments and they considered that important public interests often depended on such co-operation.\n\nIn the 1860's there were a number of sub-departments of the Board of Land and Works which were responsible for implementing the decisions of the Board. The sub-departments were responsible for the operational management of all functions for which the Board had statutory responsibility, including crown lands and survey, roads and bridges, public works and railways. The sub-departments all had separate staffs and some had Responsible Ministers but all were subject to the statutory control of the Board. Each sub-department had a secretary for the Board of Land and Works who maintained separately the correspondence and decisions of the Board in relation to the functions for which they were responsible.\n\nIn 1865 An Act to Amend and Consolidate the Laws Relating to Public Works (No.289) (referred to as the Public Works Statute) was passed. Section 12 lists the duties of the Board as \"... consider and determine all matters and questions relating to the adoption of any plans and specifications for public works and shall consider and deal with all requisitions for buildings, furniture, or repairs and shall decide upon the acceptance of all tenders for such works, buildings, furniture or repairs and the terms and conditions on which the same shall be accepted ... and all other matters and questions relating to or concerning the public lands, works and buildings of the colony.\" Together with its responsibility for public lands and works the Board was also responsible for overseeing the construction and maintenance of railways, sewerage works, domestic water supply works for both Melbourne and Geelong, and the electric telegraph lines. Such responsibility extended to the making of by-laws and the levying of tolls, etc. The sub-departments under the statutory umbrella of the Board were the bodies actually engaged in the performance of the duties. This Act also increased the number of vice-presidents to two.\n\nThe Board appears to have continued in much the same fashion throughout its more than one hundred years of operation. Various functions were assumed and others transferred to other agencies but the actual role of the Board in relation to the departments under its statutory authority remained stable.\n\nAbolition\n\nIn the latter half of the 1950's two events occurred which eventually caused the disbanding of the Board of Land and Works. They were the Mudge Case involving compensation claims for North-West Mallee settlers who were forced to leave their blocks under government policies to enlarge the size of holdings; and the contract between the Board of Land and Works and W.C. Burne & Sons for a construction job. The Burne case was the subject of an investigation by the Committee of Public Accounts which attacked the administration of the Board and cast doubt upon the legality of constituting the Board departmentally as had been the tradition since the 1860's. It also questioned the anomalous and inconsistent situation of the Commissioners or Ministers being either President or Vice-President of the Board.\n\nIn 1963 a Bill to dissolve the Board of Land and Works and substitute Ministerial control fo... truncated"

    "description": "The Melbourne Branch of the Royal Mint was established by Order-in-Council on 10 August 1869 and was opened for coinage in 1872. It was intended by its operation to stabilise the price of gold by providing a local market and to convert gold into a legally acceptable form. The Mint was under the sole control of the United Kingdom Treasury and its employees were classed as officers of the British Civil Service. Only as a branch of the Royal Mint could it mint sovereigns and half-sovereigns which were Imperial coins. Gold coins were minted until 1931. After that, gold refined was cast into fine gold bars for export.\n\nAfter Federation a demand developed for a distinctive Australian currency and this was authorised by the Australian Coinage Act 1909. Australian silver coin minted in London was issued between 1910 and 1915 and bronze coin minted in England and India was issued from 1911 to 1919. During World War I, this local token coinage was undertaken by the Australian branch mints and the first issues of silver minted at Melbourne were made in 1916 and issues of bronze were made in 1919.\n\nFor many years the major activity of the Melbourne Mint was the production of coin for the Commonwealth Government with all the silver coin and a large part of the bonze produced in Melbourne. The original functions of the purchase and refining of gold continued though their importance was relatively reduced by the decrease in gold production. Gold and silver in various forms and alloys was prepared and supplied to manufacturers and others with medals of gold, silver or bronze being struck for various bodies.\n\nIn May 1970 Queen Elizabeth II issued a Proclamation discontinuing the Melbourne Branch of the Royal Mint from July 1 1970.\n\nOther records relating to the establishment of the Royal Mint, Melbourne Branch may be found in VPRS 1099 Files on the Royal Mint."

    "description": "Appointment of Colonial Secretary\n\nCharles Joseph La Trobe remained Superintendent of the Port Phillip District (VRG 11) until 1850 when he was re-appointed Lieutenant-Governor in the new Crown Colony which came formally into existence on 13 January 1851. The Colonial Secretary was the chief official of Government during the period 1851 to 1855.\n\nFunctions Administered by the Colonial Secretary\n\nFunctions inherited from the Superintendent and administered directly through the Colonial Secretary's Office included:\n\n census and statistics\n education\n goldfields administration, including the Chinese on the goldfields\n health\n immigration\n libraries\n police administration and prisons\n protection of Aborigines\n management and sale of Crown Lands\n public works and buildings\n roads and bridges\n\nThe Colonial Secretary also came to have responsibility for the care and control of lunatics, recording births, deaths and marriages, the registration of theatre licences, and the Colony's first art gallery and museum. In 1854 and 1855 the Colonial Secretary also was responsible for the Gold Office.\n\nAborigines\n\nThe Protectorate system established in 1839 under Chief Protector George Robinson (VA 512) continued until 1849 when The Guardian of Aborigines (VA 513) was appointed following a Select Committee report which recommended the abolition of the Protectorate. The Guardian was solely responsible for providing \"protection to Aborigines\" and the Crown Land Commissioners were appointed as honorary protectors, their duties being to visit reserves, report on the condition of Aborigines and supply Aborigines with food and clothing \"in cases of extreme emergency\".\n\nNOTE: For a brief history of the administration of policy and programs relating to Aborigines in Victoria, see VRG 58 Aboriginal Affairs.\n\nCensus and Statistics, Registration of Births, Deaths and Marriages\n\nCollection of statistics and periodic census taking was at first the responsibility of the Statistics Branch of the Colonial Secretary's Office. In 1853 compulsory registration of births, deaths and marriages was introduced under the Act 16 Vic., No.26 and the Registrar-General's Department (VA 2889) was established to administer this function. It also took over responsibilities relating to census and statistics. Prior to 1853 the births, deaths and marriages records were maintained by the churches. For a brief history of these functions, see VRG 69 Property and Services and the relevant agencies.\n\nEducation\n\nEarly schools were run by religious organisations. In 1848 a Board of National Education (VA 920) and a Denominational School Board had been established in New South Wales (see List of Holdings 2nd edition 1985, section 3.8.2) to regulate denominational schools and provide for government funded education. In the Port Phillip District a Denominational School Board (VA 703) - see List of Holdings 2nd edition 1985, section 3.8.3 - had been set up in the same year to regulate and inspect the secular aspects of denominational schools supported by public funding. In 1852 the Victorian National Schools Board (VA 919) - see List of Holdings 2nd edition 1985, section 3.8.1. - was established with responsibility for regulating government schools, appointing teachers and maintaining school buildings.\n\nNote: For further information about the history of education, see VRG 35 Education.\n\nHealth\n\nA small general hospital had been established in Melbourne in 1841 under Assistant Colonial Surgeon Cussen. By 1851, following separation from New South Wales, the civil establishment for the Medical Department, which was responsible to the Colonial Secretary, included the Colonial Surgeon, Melbourne, who was also Surgeon to the Gaol and Surgeon to the Lunatic Asylum, the District Surgeon, Geelong, a Dispenser and the Superintendent and staff of the Lunatic Asylum at Yarra Bend (VA 2839). By 1852 there were also Assistant Colonial Surgeons in Melbourne, Geelong, Williamstown and Ovens and by 1854 District Surgeons had also been appointed to Portland, Belfast, Castlemaine, Sandhurst, Ballarat, Avoca, Beechworth, Kyneton and Kilmore. Other medical staff were based at Pentridge and at the hospitals established on the goldfields at Castlemaine, Sandhurst and Ballarat.\n\nThe Chief Medical Officer and the Medical Officers in Melbourne were responsible for immigrants from the time of their landing until their departure from the Immigration Depot, for the police, and for the officers and prisoners in gaols and stockades. In the seaport towns and the goldfields they were responsible for immigrants, police, military, prisoners and officers of the gold commission.\n\nThe Health Officer, who was primarily concerned with quarantine, was Superintendent of the Sanitary Station which had been established in 1852 at Ticonderoga Bay, Point Nepean, until 1853 when he was transferred to Queenscliff and ordered to board every inward bound ship and ascertain the state of health of its passengers and crew and where necessary to place the ship in quarantine.\n\nIn 1855, under the provisions of the Public Health Act 18 Vic.,No.13 (1854), the Central Board of Health was established and became responsible for the prevention, containment and treatment of infectious and contagious diseases; the construction and maintenance of adequate drains and sewers; the regulation of noxious trades; the enforcement of standards of proper sanitation; regulation of the preparation and sale of food and drink; the compulsory vaccination of children; and the registration and control of common lodging houses. Local Boards of Health, which were effectively the municipal councils, also had a significant role in the administration of public health. (See also VRG 12 Municipalities.)\n\nPrior to 1848 lunatics were detained in the District's gaols or sent to the asylum in New South Wales. The first permanent asylum in Victoria was built at Yarra Bend in 1848 (VA 2839). When it first opened it was officially a ward of the Asylum at Tarban Creek in New South Wales. However responsibility for the administration of the asylum was shared between the Superintendent of the Asylum and the Colonial Surgeon as part of his general responsibility for Health. They reported to the Colonial Secretary.\n\nNote: For a brief history of the administration of health from 1836 to 1989 see VRG 39 Health and VRG 8 Health and Welfare Agencies.\n\nImmigration\n\nThe Colonial Secretary's Office was responsible for administering immigration in conjunction with the British Emigration Agent in London, who supervised the selection of applicants and arranged for their passage. In carrying out this function the British Emigration Agent and the Colonial Secretary's Office were assisted by locally appointed Immigration Agents. Between 1851 and 1855 over 350,000 migrants arrived under Government funded and ly sponsored schemes, as well as unassisted. During the Gold Rush period, 1851 to 1861, most migrants paid their own way and Government Schemes were largely eclipsed. The responsibilities of the Colonial Secretary's Office included local administration of Government funded assisted immigration schemes, reception and initial settlement of immigrants, as well as monitoring immigrant arrivals including inspection of ships and certification of passenger lists, and regulating alien immigration.\n\nNote: For a brief history of the administration of immigration from 1836 to 1983, see VRG 68 Immigration and Ethnic Affairs.\n\nManagement and Sale of Crown Lands\n\nCommissioners of Crown Lands were appointed to regulate the use of Crown Land under licence, manage Crown Lands and supervise their sale. The Commissioners reported to the Colonial Secretary and received administrative support from the Land Branch of the Colonial Secretary's Office until 1853 when the Department of Crown Lands (VA 2878) was established (see VRG 18 Lands and VRG 27 District Land Offices for further details).\n\nPublic Works and Buildings, Roads and Bridges\n\nThe first public works and road building were undertaken by convict labourers overseen by the military detachment responsible for guarding them. The first Clerk of Works was appointed in mid 1837 and the first Overseer of Roads in September. Plans for the settlement's early public buildings were prepared by the Colonial Architect in Sydney but the locally appointed Clerk of Works took direction from the Police Magistrate and subsequently the Superintendent.\n\nA Superintendent of Bridges was appointed in 1844 with responsibility for overseeing a range of public works, including roads and bridges. In May 1846, Henry Ginn was appointed Clerk of Works and by 1850, the civil establishment for public works included the Clerk of Works, Superintendent of Bridges, six overseers and clerks, a clerk and a messenger.\n\nThe period between separation from New South Wales in 1851 and the achievement of responsible government in 1855 was characterised by a large expansion in revenue, population, the size of the colonial administration and the need for public works and buildings. During this period the structure of the administration was re-organised a number of times. In 1851 the Colonial Architect was responsible for the construction, maintenance, rental and furnishing of public buildings while the Superintendent of Bridges was responsible for roads and bridges and other public works. By October 1852 a Colonial Engineer had been appointed at a salary twice that received by the other two officials and appears to have exercised joint responsibility with them. By 1854 there had been an amalgamation of the functions of the Colonial Engineer and the Colonial Architect, the latter position having been abolished, and while the position of Superintendent of Bridges remained, it was clearly subordinate to that of the Colonial Engineer. Each of these officials was responsible to the Colonial Secretary.\n\nIn 1853 under the provisions of An Act for making and improving Roads in the Colony of Victoria, the Central Roads Board (VA 2803) was established and assumed responsibility for the construction and maintenance of proclaimed main roads and bridges. The Act also provided for municipal responsibility for local roads and bridges, subject to the general superintendence of the Board, and District Road Boards were established. Under the provisions of their own Acts, the towns of Melbourne and Geelong were also responsible for the construction and maintenance of local roads and bridges.\n\nThe Returns of Public Works, Civil Establishment lists (see VPRS 943 Blue Books) and Finance Statements for the years 1851 to 1854 give some indication of the very rapid expansion in the administration of the public works function. In 1851, the civil establishment for public works was thirteen and by 1854 the combined establishment of the Colonial Engineer and the Central Roads Board was seventy-four. Appropriations for the six months from July to December 1851 totalled 13,372 pounds and by 1853 the appropriations for public works and buildings and roads and bridges had risen to 1,314,056 pounds for the year.\n\nOn the achievement of responsible government in 1855, the Public Works Department (VA 669) assumed responsibility for all public works functions and the Central Roads Board (VA 2803) continued to be responsible for roads and bridges until its abolition in 1858.\n\nTheatre Licences\n\nUnder the provisions of An Act t... truncated"

It assumed responsibility for the functions previously undertaken separately by the Registrar-General's Department and the Office of Titles, with the Chief Officer having the triple title of Registrar-General, Registrar of Titles, and Registrar of the Supreme Court until the latter title was dropped in April 1945.\n\nIn 1887 responsibility for the Drafting Branch (Land Titles) was transferred from the Department of Crown Lands and Survey (VA 538) to the Office of the Registrar-General and the Office of Titles. This branch was responsible for the preparation and verification of plans associated with certificates of title and applications lodged under the Transfer of Land Statute 29 Vic.,No.301, (1866).\n\nFunctions Exercised from 1873\n\nThe Registrar-General's responsibilities have included:\n\n\\* registering, indexing, providing a search service and issuing certificates for all births, deaths and marriages (until 1893)\n\n\\* registering the clergy and performing civil marriages (until 1893)\n\n\\* compiling statistics and the `Blue Books' and periodic census taking (until 1874)\n\n\\* registering public vaccinations for which District Registrars were responsible\n\n\\* registering copies of orders of sequestration and adjudications of sequestration forwarded by Chief Clerks of the various district Courts of Insolvency under the provisions of successive Insolvency Acts from 1870.

The Office was also responsible for drafting, guaranteeing and issuing titles and leases, providing sworn valuations and collecting conveyancing and search fees.\n\nFunctions Subsequently Transferred to Other Agencies\n\nFunctions for which the Office of the Registrar-General and Office of Titles ceased to have responsibility have included:\n\n\\* compilation of statistics and periodic census taking which were transferred to the Office of the Government Statist and Actuary (VA 989) in the Chief Secretary's Department (VA 475) in May 1874\n\n\\* all the functions relating to stamp duties, fees collection and the Registrar-General's role as Comptroller of Stamps which were transferred to the Collector of Imposts Office created within the Law Department (VA 2825) in 1889 under the Stamp Duties Amendment Act 52 Vic.,No.1010\n\n\\* the registration of patents which was transferred to the Commissioner of Patents within the Law Department (VA 864) in 1889 under the Patents Act 53 Vic.,No.1034\n\n\\* all the functions connected with the registration of Births, Deaths and Marriages, registration of the clergy and performance of civil marriages which were transferred to the Office of the Government Statist and Actuary (VA 989) in the Chief Secretary's Department (VA 475) in 1893 under the Births, Deaths and Marriages Act 56 Vic.,No.1303, possibly formalising what may have already been happening in practice\n\n\\* all the powers and functions relating to the registration of copyright, with provision for those registered prior to the commencement of the Act, which were transferred from the Office and from state jurisdiction, and vested in the Registrar of Copyright and the Copyright Office under the Commonwealth Copyright Act in 1905 (No.25)\n\n\\* the registration of trademarks which was transferred from the Office and state jurisdiction, and vested in the Registrar of Trademarks and the Trade Marks Office under the Commonwealth Trade Marks Act in 1905 (No.20)\n\n\\* registration of companies which was transferred to the Registrar of Companies and the Companies Office (VA 2725) created within the Law Department (VA 864) under the Companies Act No.(6455) (1958)\n\n\\* registration of inquests which was transferred to the State Coroner's Office (VA 2807) in mid-1988. From 1856 inquest depositions which were no longer required for the administration of justice had been forwarded by the Crown Prosecutor to the Office of the Registrar-General.\n\n\\* the registration orders and adjudications of sequestration of the estates of insolvents was transferred from the Office and state jurisdiction to the Commonwealth Government in 1928 under the provisions of a Bankruptcy Act.\n\nOrganisational Structure\n\nThe Office of Titles was divided into two branches originally - a 'professional' or legal branch headed by the Commissioner of Titles, and the 'non-professional' branch headed by the Registrar of Titles. The Commissioner had legal responsibility for proving land titles on receipt of the examiner's report, and liaising with applicants and solicitors.\n\nThe Registrar of Titles had the power to take statutory declarations, correct errors in registration and lodge caveats on behalf of infant, disabled or absent persons, amongst other responsibilities.\n\nIn 1890, responsibility for the administration of the Registrar-General's Office, the Office of Titles, and the Commissioner of Titles Office was split and shared between the Registrar-General, the Registrar of Titles, and the Chief Examiner of Titles respectively. In 1893, the former two offices were again combined as the Registrar-General and Registrar (or Office) of Titles, under the one administration. The Commissioner of Titles Office then remained as a separate office for which the Registrar-General and Registrar of Titles ceased to have responsibility.\n\nHowever, following the Transfer of Land Act 1954 (No.5842), a significant re-organisation in the administration of the Office of the Registrar-General and Office of Titles occurred in which the legal powers and duties previously vested in the Commissioner of Titles were vested in the Registrar of Titles, and the position of Commissioner of Titles was abolished.\n\nTransfer of Office from Law (VRG 19) to Property and Services (VRG 69) 1985\n\nUnder the provisions of Administrative Arrangements Order No.19 of March 1985, responsibility for the Office of the Registrar-General and the Office of Titles was transferred from the Law Department (VA 2825) to the Department of Property and Services (VA 430). However, the Office continued under the administration of the Law Department until October 1985. On transfer to the Department of Property and Services, the Office of Titles became informally known as the Land Titles Office.\n\nThe Torrens System of Land Registration\n\nGeoffrey Sawer describes the Torrens System, adopted in Victoria in 1862, thus:\n\n This method of registering and transferring titles to land is generally attributed to Robert Torrens, a South Australian government official, and he certainly had a good deal to do with the adoption of the system in that State in 1858. The system spread throughout Australia and to many other countries. A large part of Australian land has been brought under Torrens title, and more comes under it every year, but in some areas there are still many acres which have not been brought under it and are usually referred to as 'old-law' land. There are methods of registering documents of title in relation to old-law land in official registries; this facilitates dealings in such land. However, these methods only lead one to the documents by which successive owners have acquired their interests; the 'title' consists of an aggregation of these documents, and the person wishing to buy such land has to run the risk that in a long and complex series of deeds he fails to understand properly what has happened or overlooks some weakness in or encumbrance on the title. Often a purchaser of 'old-law' land is unhappy unless he can trace title clear back to a Crown grant, which is a long, tedious process.\n\n The Torrens system provides instead a single registered title document which authoritatively and beyond challenge states who is currently the 'registered proprietor' of the fee simple in the land; there may be a separate title document for derivative interests such as leases and mortgages, but if so the main title carries a note of them, and encumbrances such as easements are also endorsed on that title. After the system was adopted State by State, all fresh Crown grants were registered in this way. Exhaustive searches are made by officials of the Titles Offices when land previously granted by the Crown is brought under the Acts - which was at first done voluntarily and is now in many cases compulsory - to make sure that a person currently claiming to be the owner is in fact such. Often, for the reasons mentioned above, his title can be traced back in the manner usual for old-law land clear to the original Crown grant.\n\n Once registration is effected, all the earlier history is forgotten and the earlier documents become superfluous, so far as persons now dealing with the land are concerned. A person wanting to buy a block of land can by various means track the block down through the Titles Offices indices, and will find on the main title document a simple and clear statement that so and so is the registered proprietor, and the buyer knows that if he finds that person, obtains a transfer in the prescribed form and has his, the buyer's, name placed on the register in place of that of the former owner, he will have a secure title, subject to the encumbrances appearing in the register. It was a feature of the system... truncated"

    "title": "His Majesty's Gaol, Pentridge (known as Pentridge Prison)",
    "description": "Pentridge Prison was originally established as a temporary stockade in 1850 to alleviate overcrowding at the Melbourne Gaol. It was known as the Pentridge Stockade Complex, an ad-hoc group of structures built by the prisoners.\n\nIn 1858, construction began on Inspector General William Champ's model prison complex, based on British models, and incorporating a new system of prisoner classification and ideas about penal reform. The prison continued to be enlarged and expanded throughout the 1860s and 1870s and became known as the Pentridge Penal Establishment. Following the Stawell Royal Commission of 1870, an extensive work program for prisoners was introduced.\n\nIn 1894, a new prison was erected within the outer walls of Pentridge for female prisoners. The Female Prison, Pentridge (VA 4141) was proclaimed in May 1894 under the Gaols Act 1890, as a separate establishment for female prisoners, operating within the walls of Pentridge Gaol.\n\nIn 1932, the Female Prison was incorporated, along with the Metropolitan Gaol and the Penal Establishment Pentridge, into His Majesty's Gaol, Pentridge. Both the Female Prison and the Metropolitan Prison were revoked as separate institutions. From 1933, female prisoners were held in the Female Division within HM Gaol Pentridge, under the charge of a Matron, while the former Metropolitan Gaol became D Division, the receiving division for the whole of Pentridge.\n\nThe consolidation of Pentridge meant that the prison system became more centralised, with most prisoners being received at Pentridge before being assessed, classified and then sent to other prisons. It was also the largest prison in Victoria, accounting for approximately half the prisoners in Victoria at any time.\n\nUnder the provisions of the Indeterminate Sentences Act 1907 (No. 2106), Pentridge was classified as a combination Reformatory Prison and Gaol, unlike most of the other prisons in Victoria which were classified as one or the other. The Penal Reform Act 1956 (No. 5961) abolished Reformatory Prisons and Pentridge became known as Her Majesty's Prison, Pentridge.\n\nG Division was the prison's on-site hospital for prisoners.\n\nThe conditions at Pentridge were often not ideal, with many annual reports noting the poor conditions and overcrowding. As a maximum security prison, Pentridge was often the site of prisoner uprisings and protests, the most famous being the prison fire in the Jika Jika High Security Unit in 1987, which resulted in the deaths of five prisoners and the closure of the Jika Jika Unit.\n\nIn April 1995, the Office of Corrections ordered that the six main towers at Pentridge be closed, since most of the high security prisoners from the jail had been relocated to Barwon as part of the downgrading of Pentridge to a medium security prison.\n\nPentridge closed in December 1997 and was replaced by the privately run Port Phillip Prison."

    "title": "Department of the Treasurer (also known as Treasury and Treasurer's Office)",
    "description": "Establishment and Functions\n\nThe Department was established in 1851 to administer the new Colony's finances, collect revenue and monitor expenditure.\n\nDuring the period 1851 to 1982 the Department was variously known as:\n\nColonial Treasurer's Office 1851-1855\nTreasury 1855-1860\nTreasurer's Office 1860-1883\nDepartment of the Treasurer 1883-1958\nTreasury 1958-1982\n\nAs the economy of the Colony and later the State developed, the role of the Department expanded to encompass economic policy development, financial planning, resource management, investment and loan-raising, and budget preparation and monitoring.\n\nAssociated Authorities and Functions\n\nA number of large statutory authorities with financial responsibilities came to be associated with the Department in the Treasurer's portfolio, including the State Bank (VA 1041); State Insurance Office (VA 1033), inherited from the Chief Secretary's Department (VA 475) in 1979; the State Taxation Office responsible for administering payroll and land tax, and the collection of probate and gift duties; State Tender Board, responsible for all government tenders and contracts over a specified amount, and the Stamp Duties Office. The Tender Board dates from the period 1851 to 1855, while the Treasury's responsibility for savings banks (inherited from the Chief Secretary (VA 475)) dates from 1896. The Treasury was responsible for probate and stamp duties from the 1870's, and for land tax (inherited from the Department of Crown Lands and Survey (VA 538)) from 1903. From 1851 until 1968 the Department also had responsibilities for liquor licence issue and registration (see VRG 23 Treasurer for more detail).\n\nAgencies responsible for superannuation and pension schemes for government employees have also been included in the Treasurer's portfolio. In the pre-1982 period these included schemes relating to public servants, railway employees and teachers.\n\nTaxation\n\nColonial Taxation\nThe earliest taxes imposed in Victoria were customs duties which were placed upon a range of imported and exported goods and were administered by the Department of Trade and Customs (VA 606) from 1851. Throughout the second half of the nineteenth century the government introduced a number of taxes and duties administered by various offices within the Colonial Government. Amongst these taxes were; duties on estates of deceased persons, established under the Duties on the Estates of Deceased Persons Act 1870, a land tax established by the Land Tax Act 1877 and duties on the production of tobacco and beer.\n\nOf all colonial taxes, import and export duties were by far the most significant, accounting for approximately one quarter of the Colony's revenue, however jurisdiction for all customs duties was transferred to the Commonwealth upon federation in 1901.\n\nIncome Tax\n\nIncome tax was introduced into Victoria in 1895 under the Income Tax Act 1895 (No.1374). This Act imposed a tax on all income derived by any person either by personal exertion of from the produce of property. It also introduced a tax on the revenue of companies. In order to administer this tax an income tax office was established within the Treasury. In the early part of the twentieth century the responsibilities of this office were enlarged to include the administration of other state taxes.\n\nAlthough the Commonwealth introduced a separate income tax prior to the Second World War, the States remained the major collectors of income tax throughout this period. However, due to the increased financial demands placed upon it during the Second World War the Commonwealth Government passed legislation in 1942 which effectively removed from the States the right to collect income tax and established a uniform national tax system. To compensate the States for the loss of their income tax revenue a system of annual grants from the Commonwealth to the States was introduced. Initially these arrangements were to cease at the end of the war, but they were later extended indefinitely, the basis upon which grants were made changing from one of compensation for loss of previous tax revenue to one of States' needs.\n\nIndirect Taxation 1950-1990\n\nThroughout the 1950's and 1960's the Victorian Government introduced a number of indirect taxes to compensate for the loss of its income tax revenue. The State continued to administer probate duties, land tax, taxes on the issue of a range of licences, motor vehicle registrations and on betting through the T.A.B. and bookmakers takings, amongst others.\n\nA division of the Department of the Treasurer continued to oversee the administration of these taxes and from the early 1970's onwards became known as the State Taxation Office or State Tax Office. In 1971 the right to impose payroll tax was transferred from the Commonwealth to the States and in Victoria the Payroll Tax Act 1971 (No. 8154) established a system for administering the tax. Since that time payroll tax has been the State's most important source of tax revenue.\n\nIn the 1980's the Commonwealth Government alone exercises the right to impose customs and excise duties, sales tax and personal and company income tax. The ambit of taxation now left to the States comprises motor taxation, stamp duties, liquor, land, lottery, racing, payroll and entertainment taxes. The collection of gift duties is shared between the Commonwealth and the States as are probate duties. The latter were abolished in Victoria on 1 January 1984. Since that time the State Tax Office has collected duties on a decreasing number of estates relating to deaths prior to 1984.\n\nTransfers of Functions\n\nHistorically the Treasurer's Department has been responsible for a range of other functions, including post offices in 1856 and 1857; the administration of the estates of deceased persons and those incapable of managing their own affairs until 1931 when this responsibility passed to the Law Department (VA 2825); the Public Trustees Office from 1945 to 1949, a responsibility inherited from and passed back to Law (VA 2825); the administration of financial grants to the arts until 1972 when the Ministry of Arts (VA 1025) was established; and the Government Printer (VA 1035) until 1978 when it became part of the Department of Property and Services (VA 430).\n\nIn 1895 the Inspector of Charities was transferred to the Department from Chief Secretary's (VA 475) and in 1923 the Charities Board (VA 2707) was established to administer the Hospital and Charities Act 1922 (No. 3260). The Treasurer was responsible for the hospitals and charities function until 1944 when its administration was transferred to the Minister of Health (VRG 39).\n\nFrom 1937 the Housing Commission (VA 508) was established within the Department of the Treasurer. It continued administratively to be part of the Department until 1973 when the Commission was transferred to the Ministry of Housing (VA 609), although from 1945 ministerial responsibility for the Commission was exercised not by the Treasurer but by the Minister of Housing (VRG 53).\n\nAgencies responsible for registering and monitoring building and co-operative societies were located within the Department until 1973 when they were also transferred to the Ministry of Housing (VA 609).\n\nAdministrative Support to Head of Government\n\nThe Treasurer has frequently also been the head of government or Premier (see VRG 23 for further information).\n\nAdministrative support for the head of government function was initially provided by the Chief Secretary's Office within the Chief Secretary's Department (VA 475). By 1883, in view of the fact that the head of government was no longer always the Chief Secretary, separate administrative arrangements were made and a Premier's Department or Office (VA 672) was established.\n\nThe functions of the Premier's Department on its establishment were set down in an Order-in-Council of 29 May 1883:\n\n correspondence with other colonies, governments and the Agent-General\n correspondence with the Governor, including despatches from the Secretary of State in Britain referred by the Governor to Ministers\n matters referred to the Premier and Cabinet by other Ministers or departments for their consideration\n other matters concerning the Premier\n issuing Cabinet circulars and attending upon Cabinet (VA 2989)\n matters relating to the Public Service as a whole.\n\nThe Office's role in the central co-ordination of Government policy gradually expanded. Following Federation in 1900 it also became responsible for relations with the Commonwealth and other States.\n\nFrom 1884 to 1890 this Office functioned as a sub-department within the Department of the Treasurer (VA 865); from 1890 to 1894 as a separate Department of State; from 1894 to 1928 as a sub-department within the Chief Secretary's Department; and from 1928 to 1936 again as a sub-department within the Department of the Treasurer (VA 865).\n\nFrom December 1936, the Department of the Premier (VA 2717) and from 1982 the Department of the Premier and Cabinet (VA 1039) have assisted the Premier in his/her head of government functions and the co-ordination of government policies and programs.\n\nThe Public Service Board/Commissioner (VA 886) was also located in the Treasurer's Department from 1883 to 1894 and in 1936 and 1937.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nThe Public Record Office has substantial holdings of the Department of the Treasurer's records. The Treasurer's correspondence and financial records are an important source of information about many aspects of government administration as they provide details of the provision of funds to other departments and authorities, the activities being funded and how the money has been expended.\n\nSee also List of Holdings 2nd edition 1985, sections 3.22.0 (Treasurer's records), 3.12.0.

The additional Terms of Reference were\n\n(b) any lawful incidents that occurred in the City of Richmond in the period 1 August 1981 to 8 August 1981 inclusive which were related to the elections for councillors for the City of Richmond conducted on 8 August 1981 and, in particular, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to inquire into and report on -\n\n(i) whether any person committed any criminal offence\n\n(ii) the purpose for which the said person or persons committed such offence or offences\n\n(iii) whether any person or persons arranged or co-ordinated the said incidents\n\n(iv) the purpose for which the said person or persons arranged or co-ordinated the said incidents; and\n\n(v) whether there is evidence admissible in a Court of Law sufficient to place any person on trial for any offence.\n\n\nThere were four subsequent Orders-in-Council for this Board of Inquiry, three of these Orders extended the date of delivery of the final report and one Order authorised the increase in expenditure for the Board of Inquiry.\n\nAn interim report of the Board of Inquiry was tabled in Parliament on 15 December 1981. The interim report was published in Papers Presented to Parliament: Session 1981-1982, Vol 9, No. 9. The report stated that the annual elections held in 1980 and the by-elections held in April 1981 demonstrated serious electoral frauds. It was concluded that a number of ALP (Australian Labor Party) councillors might not have been elected had the poll been conducted honestly.\n\nThe final report of the Board of Inquiry (also referred to as the Nicholson Report) was presented to the Governor on the 28 June 1982 and tabled in Parliament on 29 June 1982.

As a result of this report, the Governor proposed a Bill to authorize the establishment of a Commission to administer the City of Richmond, dismiss the Council of the City of Richmond from Office and to provide for the restoration of an Elected Council and for other purposes. This Bill was assented as the Local Government (City of Richmond) Act 1982, on July 6 1982.\n\nThe Board of Inquiry's report also lead to the introduction of freedom of information legislation, by the newly elected Labor Government in 1982. Previously matters pertaining to local government were exempt from the provisions of the Local Government Act 1958.\n\nThe Board of Inquiry's report suggested a number of amendments to the Local Government Act which were aimed at improving the conduct of council elections. The Local Government Act 1989 incorporated the suggested amendments of the Nicholson report which included; council and committee meetings to be held in public, creation of municipal electoral tribunals and penalties of six months to two years imprisonment; six months imprisonment for multiple voting and up to two years imprisonment for returning officers tampering with or fraudulently altering voting materials."

The constitution of the Trust was altered and its name changed. The new body was to be responsible for the administration and maintenance of Water Supply and Sewerage for the Town of Geelong and District.\nThe alteration of the name was to come into effect on 30 March 1910. The Trust was reconstituted in 1950, 1966 and 1979 when the number of Commissioners was varied.\nThe Geelong Waterworks and Sewerage Trust was merged into the new Geelong and District Water Board on 1 July 1984 under the Water and Sewerage Authorities (Restructuring) Act 1983. This structured change was part of the statewide re-organisation of the water industry, bringing most small authorities under the umbrella of larger regional bodies.\nFrom 1995, water and sewerage for this region has been under the control of the Barwon Region Water Authority."

    "description": "Establishment\n\nThe Legal Aid Commission was established on 1 September 1981 under the provisions of the Legal Aid Commission Act 1978 (No.9245). The Commission superseded the Legal Aid Committee (VA 878), the Office of the Public Solicitor (VA 2282) and the Australian Legal Aid Office (VA 4150).\n\nA change of name from Legal Aid Commission to Legal Aid Commission of Victoria occurred on 1 May 1986 following proclamation of the Legal Aid Commission (Amendment) Act 1986. However there was no change in the Commission's functions.\n\nThe Legal Aid Commissioners were responsible to the Attorney-General under s30 (2) of the Legal Aid Commission Act 1978.\n\nThe Commissioners met on a monthly basis, although ad hoc meetings were also held throughout the year. The Commission consisted of the Chairperson of the Legal Aid Commission and ten Commissioners nominated by the Attorney-General's Department, the Law Institute of Victoria, the Victorian Bar Council, the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth, the staff of the Commission, the Minister for Community Services from names submitted by the Victorian Council of Social Services, the Director of the Legal Aid Commission and an individual personally selected by the Attorney-General as a person having had experience in the provision of voluntary legal services.\n\nThe Legal Aid Commission received funding from the Victorian and Commonwealth Governments and from three other sources. These were a portion of the interest earned on investment of solicitors' trust funds, contributions made by legally assisted persons and legal costs awarded by the courts to legally assisted persons.\n\nStructure\n\nThe Legal Aid Commission was organised into a Directorate and six Divisions. Each division was managed by an Associate Director. The six divisions were Assignments, Criminal Law, Education and Information, Family Law, General Law, and Regional Offices.\n\nThe Directorate consisted of the Director and Deputy Director. The Director was responsible to the Commission for the administration of the legal aid scheme established by the Act and supervised the provision of legal aid by Commission staff. The Deputy Director assisted and deputised for the Director, supervising the Investigations and Freedom of Information Officer and was responsible for the Personnel Branch.\n\nThe Assignments Division received and assigned or refused applications for legal assistance, monitored grants of assistance and assessed legal costs.\n\nThe Criminal Law revision acted for legally assisted persons charged with indictable offences. It provided a visiting advice service to the Metropolitan Reception, Pentridge and Fairlea Prisons.\n\nThe Education and Information Division provided community legal education programmes, continuing legal education for staff, and library services to staff and the general public. It also conducted legal research and public information functions, and provided support for law reform activities.\n\nThe Family Law Division acted for legally assisted persons in family law matters and provided a family law advice service.\n\nThe General Law Division acted for legally assisted persons in civil, welfare and summary criminal matters. It provided duty lawyer services in Children's Courts and at Melbourne and Prahran Magistrate's Courts.\n\nThe Regional Offices Division performed the full range of legal aid functions through regional offices.\n\nAbolition\n\nThe Legal Aid Commission of Victoria was abolished on 14 December 1995 and replaced by VA 4160 Victoria Legal Aid. The change was effected by the Legal Aid Commission (Amendment) Act 1995 (No.48/1995).\n\nLocation of Records\n\nSee below.

Notice was given on the 20th of January 1853 that a site had been fixed for the Township of Castlemaine, and that a Plan of the approved township could be seen at the Surveyor General's Office in Melbourne, or at the Police Office in Castlemaine itself. The first Land Sales of Castlemaine Township land sold under An Act for Regulating the Sale of Waste Lands Belonging to the Crown in the Australian Colonies 1842 (5 & 6 Vict., C36) were held on the 15th of February 1853.\n\nCastlemaine was proclaimed a municipal district in accordance An Act for the Establishment of Municipal Institutions in Victoria 1854 (18 Vic. Act No 15). Under this Act any district within the Colony of Victoria of an area not exceeding nine miles square, and of a population of at least three hundred householders, could become a municipal district. A petition signed by at least one hundred and fifty local residents was to be provided to the Lieutenant Governor, who took advice from the Executive Council before making a decision. The first meeting of the Council was held on the 28th of January 1856.\n\nCastlemaine was constituted as a Borough under the Municipal Institutions Act 1863 (27 Victoria, Act No 184), and was listed in Schedule B of that Act as Municipal District Number 6. The Act enabled all Municipal Districts formulated under previous Acts (and listed in Schedule B) to become Boroughs of the districts, and became effective from the 1st of October 1863. The first Borough Council meeting was held on the 21st of October 1863\n\nThe Borough of Castlemaine was declared to be a Town by Order-in-Council dated the 19th of December 1949, to take effect from the 30th of January 1950. This was in accordance with the provisions of the Local Government Act 1946 (Act No. 5203), and to comply with a petition presented to the Executive Council by the Borough of Castlemaine Council.\n\nCastlemaine was declared to be a City in accordance with the provisions of the Local Government Act 1958 (Act No. 6299) by Order-in-Council , to take effect from the 4th of December 1965. Under this Act, any borough having received at least thirty thousand pounds in revenue received from general and extra rates over the previous council year may petition the Governor-in-Council to declare their borough a City.\n\nThis council was abolished on 19 January 1995 as part of a statewide program of local government reform enacted between 1993 and 1995. The reform process reduced the number of councils from 210 to 78. The Mount Alexander Shire Council (VA 3711) has been appointed as the successor in law of the City of Castlemaine and has assumed its rights, assets and liabilities."

    "title": "National School Board",
    "description": "Establishment of the National School Board\n\nThe Board of National Education for the Colony of Victoria, commonly known as the National School Board was established in late December 1851 under the provisions of An Act to incorporate the Board of Commissioners for National Education 15 Vic.,No.7, taking over the role previously carried out by the New South Wales Board of Education (VA 920) for the oversight of schools outside the ambit of the Denominational School Board (VA 703). The members of the Board were appointed by the Governor with the advice of the Executive Council.\n\nFunctions\n\nThe Board was responsible for the distribution of funds to schools, the management and government of schools, the appointment of teachers and the inspection and maintenance of schools.\n\nBackground to the Establishment of the Board of National Education and the Denominational School Board in 1848; and subsequently the National School Board in 1852\n\nSchools in the Port Phillip District were not subject to direct Government administration until 1848 when the Government of New South Wales established the Denominational School Board (VA 703) and the Board of National Education (VA 920). Prior to that time financial assistance either in the form of masters' stipends or a subsidy in proportion to local contributions was granted to schools established by recognized religious denomination and some assistance was given to parents who could not afford to pay the school fees.\n\nIn 1844 a Select Committee of the Legislative Council was appointed \"to enquire and report upon the state of education in the Colony and to devise the means of placing the education of youth upon a basis suited to the wants and wishes of the community\".\n\nThe Committee was critical of the denominational system which it considered to be excessively costly and reported that it considered the present state of education in the Colony to be extremely deficient and that many children were receiving no education at all. The Committee recommended that one uniform system of education be established.\n\nAlthough the Legislative Council endorsed the report by a slim majority, Governor Gipps did not sanction the necessary appropriations to implement the Committee's recommendations since he believed that without the co-operation of the Ministers of religion who were opposed to the recommendations it would not be possible to establish a useful general system of education.\n\nBy 1847 however, the church authorities were prepared to accept the establishment of dual boards and systems in return for increased state aid. On 4 January 1848, a General Education Board was formed for the regulation and inspections of schools to be conducted under Lord Stanley's System ie. the Irish National System which had been established by Lord Stanley in his capacity as Chief Secretary for Ireland. This system provided for the non-sectarian education of children at locally administered schools which were responsible to a national board.\n\nAppointment of Denominational School Board 1848\n\nThe Denominational School Board (VA 703) was appointed on 11 February 1848 and was responsible for the distribution of funds to denominational schools from an annual Parliamentary grant and a proportion of the Church and Schools Estates Revenue. For a short period, following separation and prior to the establishment of the National School Board on 30 December 1851, the Denominational School Board was appointed to conduct business relating to National Schools.\n\nEstablishment of Board of National Education (N.S.W.) 1848\n\nThe Board of National Education (VA 920) was established under the provisions of An Act to incorporate the Board of Commissioners for National Education. (II Vic.,No.48 in 1848) which authorised the Board to acquire and hold lands and buildings. George William Reesden was appointed as Southern Agent for the Board. Under the General Instructions for the Agents in Establishing National Schools dated 23 June 1849, agents were required to encourage the establishment of new schools chiefly in those localities where education had not previously been available and were not expected to advocate the establishment of National Schools in areas where denominational schools were already in existence. The Agents were required to arrange public meetings, to provide copies of the Board's regulations, to explain the features of the National system and to assist with the selection of local patrons. They were also required to provide the Board with descriptions of proposed school sites which in settled districts were to be not less than two acres and elsewhere not less than ten acres; to report on the suitability of the proposed local patrons; to provide statistical information regarding prospective students and to provide information on the practicability of establishing industrial schools and associated boarding homes for children. The Board considered that thirty children was the minimum number of students to justify the granting of aid for the establishment of a school.\n\nThe Commissioners were prepared to grant aid towards the building and support of elementary schools and a limited number of industrial schools on the condition that at least one third of school building costs was subscribed by local residents. Under the Board's regulations of May 1848, applications for aid were to include the names of not less than three local patrons who were to be responsible to the Board. If a Crown grant of land was unobtainable, applications were to include a description of the proposed school site and the nature of its title; a conveyance of the fee simple (or lease where specifically agreed upon) was to be made to the Board of Commissioners. Upon approval of the application a plan and specification together with an estimate of expenditure was to be supplied by the local patrons.\n\nThe Commissioners were prepared to contribute part of the cost of establishing the school house and to provide school books and equipment. The Board was responsible for the appointment of teachers but was prepared to consider recommendations from local patrons.\n\nLocal patrons were responsible for the provision and maintenance of school buildings and equipment, the setting and expenditure of school fees, the inspection of school records and for monitoring and reporting on the conduct of teachers in the discharge of their duties. They were required to report annually to the Board.\n\nTo the extent that it applied to the Colony of Victoria, the 1848 Act establishing the Board of National Education was repealed with the passing of Act to incorporate the Board of Commissioners for National Education 15 Vic., No.7, 1851, following Victoria's separation from New South Wales.\n\nSelect Committee of Inquiry into Education 1851\n\nOn 8 July 1851 a Select Committee was appointed \"to enquire into and report upon the present systems of instruction of youth in this Colony, receiving support from the public revenue.....and to recommend, if found requisite, a plan of education better adapted to the wants of the Community.\" (See Votes and Proceedings of the Legislative Council, Session 1852-3). The Select Committee, whilst acknowledging the differences of opinion within the community and noting that the Denominational and the Irish National System were each supported by a large section of the community, declined to recommend that the separate systems be continued in their present form. They noted the problems caused by the rivalry and hostility around by the promoters of each of the two systems and the unnecessary costs involved in supporting a dual administration. Given the conflict of opinion, they considered that a mere amalgamation of the Boards was not feasible and recommended instead a scheme based on a plan of the Committee of Privy Council on Education be implemented.\n\nThe Committee advocated that the only requirements necessary to obtain support for a school be its efficiency in imparting sound literary and moral education and the absence of any rules requiring compulsory religious instruction. They recommended that all schools receiving assistance be known as public schools and that a single Board consisting of four laymen be appointed with responsibility for the administration of all matters connected with public instruction and the sole management of the funds allocated.\n\nThe recommendations of the Select Committee were not implemented, debate on the issue ensured for a further ten years and Victoria continued to have a dual system of publicly funded schools.\n\nTransfer of functions from the National School Board to the Board of Education (VA 713)\n\nThe National and Denominational School Boards were amalgamated to form the Board of Education (VA 713) in 1862 under the An Act for the better Maintenance and Establishment of Common Schools in Victoria 25 Vic.,No.149. This Act repealed An Act to incorporate the Board of Commissioners for National Education which had established the National School Board and all property previously vested in that Board was vested in the Board of Education (VA 713).\n\nLocation of Records\n\nSee List of Holdings 1985, section 3.8.1."

The Gallery Trustees (VA 3119 Trustees of the National Gallery of Victoria) were responsible for \"the management and control of the gallery and the general direction and control of the establishment and administration of schools of art conducted at or associated with the gallery.\"\n\nIn 1960 some changes were made to the Public Library and the Museum by the State Library National Gallery National Museum and Institute of Applied Science Act 1960 (No. 6688). That Act appears to have made little change to the Gallery or its Trustees apart from consolidating the legislation governing them.\n\nIn 1966 the National Gallery of Victoria Act 1966 (No. 7482) constituted VA 929 Council of Trustees of the National Gallery of Victoria (s 5) and set out the Council's functions (s 13). The administrative relationship between the Council and the Gallery is subject to research: Annual Reports indicate that the Council of Trustees rather than the Gallery employed some staff, including some curatorial, library, administrative, teaching and bookshop staff. The remaining staff appear to have been employed by the Gallery.\n\nThe Council of Trustees' functions were\n\n(a) to manage and control the National Gallery;\n(b) to maintain and develop the State collection of works of art;\n(c) to make material within the State collection available to persons, departments and institutions in such manner and subject to such conditions as the Council determines whether due to the most advantageous use of the State collection;\n(d) to carry out and make available such other services, including the printing publication and sale of books information and reproductions, in relation to pictures, works of art and art exhibits as the Council thinks fit;\n(e) to assist in the promotion organization and supervision of art galleries and any body or association established for the promotion of art within Victoria;\n(f) to advise the Minister and the organizations mentioned in paragraph (e) on matters of general policy relating to art galleries;\n(g) to make recommendations to the Minister on the allocation of any moneys made available by Parliament to assist art galleries;\n(h) to carry out such other functions in connexion with art galleries as the Minister from time to time directs;\n(i) to manage and control the National Gallery Art School.\n\nSubject to research, the National Gallery of Victoria is responsible for the acquisition, display and preservation of the State art collection, administration of the Heide Art Gallery and for the provision of art education.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nConsult the Inventory of Series below and the List of Holdings section 3.3.7 for records attributed to the National Gallery.

    "description": "Following the establishment of the Port Phillip District as part of the Colony of New South Wales in 1836, the Governor directed that a Branch of the Surveyor-General's Department be set up there. The first Survey officers, appointed on 10 September 1836 and led by Robert Russell, followed the newly appointed Police Magistrate for the District, William Lonsdale, arriving at Port Phillip in late September in the Stirlingshire, accompanied by a party of convict labourers, horses and tons of equipment.\n\nUnlicensed occupation of land at Port Phillip was one of the major concerns of the new administration. The government surveyors began to map the shores of Port Phillip Bay in 1836 using accurate bearings provided by HMS Rattlesnake anchored in the Bay. Gradually that work spread inland to include towns, rivers, roads and farmlands.\n\nDetailed instructions for the survey of the District, an essential preliminary to the sale of Crown lands, were given to Robert Russell by the Deputy Surveyor-General in Sydney on 10 September 1836 (Historical Records of Victoria, Volume 5, pp.6-8). Later directions issued on 15 September outlined Lonsdale's general superintendence role (p.10). Russell was soon replaced by Robert Hoddle who visited Port Phillip in March 1837 with New South Wales Governor Bourke and whose appointment was confirmed in August 1837. In the meantime Hoddle produced plans for the Town of Melbourne and acted as auctioneer at the first land sale on 1 June 1837. Hoddle's main instructions from the Surveyor-General, dated 31 July and 18 November 1837 (Historical Records of Victoria, Volume 5, pp.98-100 and pp.116-117) provided the basis for major surveys of the District in ensuing years. Late in 1839 the Survey Department prepared a list of all resulting land sales, totalling 86,000 acres and raising 117,000 pounds in revenue. In the years 1851 to 1853 Hoddle became Victoria's first Surveyor-General.\n\nRussell and Hoddle were also appointed as Commissioners of Crown Lands concurrently with their surveying duties (New South Wales Government Gazette 21 September 1836 and 10 May 1837). In this role they were among those responsible for policing the unauthorised occupation of Crown land. For information about the responsibilities of District and Field Surveyors and Commissioners of Crown Lands, see VRG 27 District Land Offices.\n\nThe Port Phillip Branch received instructions from the Surveyor-General's Department in New South Wales, but was also responsible to the Police Magistrate of the Port Phillip District (1836-1839) and subsequently the Superintendent (1839-1851), who in turn reported to the Governor of New South Wales, (see also VA 472 and VA 473). However, except for his involvement in Russell's replacement, Lonsdale's role was limited to the provision of support services. Following separation from New South Wales in 1851 a separate Surveyor General's Department (VA 2921) was established in Victoria under Robert Hoddle as Surveyor-General.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nFor records of the Surveyor-General's Department, Port Phillip Branch see List of Holdings, 2nd edition, 1985, section 3.18.4. and list below. Relevant records are also to be found in the Archives Office of New South Wales."

    "title": "Social Welfare Department",
    "description": "Establishment\n\nOn December 22 1970, under the provisions of the Social Welfare Act 1970 (No.8089), a Minister for Social Welfare was appointed. Following proclamation of the Act on 5 January 1971 the Social Welfare Department was established as a Department of State. The purposes for which the Department was established were specified in Part I, section 5 of the Act:\n\n For strengthening and expanding all existing services provided by and through the Government of Victoria for the social welfare of the community and providing further services, for co-ordinating the activities of Government municipal and voluntary organizations engaged in social work in the community and planning the effective use of their resources, for advancing the interests of deprived or underprivileged children, young persons, and adults by modern methods and treatment, for providing and maintaining training and research facilities for or towards any of the purposes of this Act and for the better promotion and development of services organizations and institutions relating to the social welfare of the community and in particular of children and young persons there shall be a Department of State called the `Social Welfare Department'...\n\nAdministered by a Director-General of Social Welfare, the Department assumed responsibility for all functions previously administered by the Social Welfare Branch, Chief Secretary's Department (VA 2784) and continued the Divisional structure which had existed in the Branch. The Department also assumed responsibility for school attendance regulation from the Education Department. In 1971 the Department assumed responsibility for funding children's homes from the Department of Health (VA 695).\n\nDivisions and Functions\n\nThe seven major divisions and the functions for which they had responsibility were:\n\nFamily Welfare Division\n\nThis Division was responsible for maintaining and upgrading various forms of substitute care for children and for the development of preventative family support services aimed at reducing the necessity for long-term substitute care. Functions included:\n\n promotion and development of family welfare\n co-ordination of voluntary organizations, Government departments, and persons concerned with provision of welfare services for families\n control and supervision of children and young persons in need of care and protection, including wardship, foster care, adoption, protection of infants, child employment, and child migrant welfare\n management and supervision of children's homes and reception centres\n family assistance (financial) and family counselling.\n\nYouth Welfare Division\n\nThe functions of this Division, which was responsible for the placement, supervision, detention and welfare of young persons, included:\n\n administration of remand centres, youth training centres and youth hostels\n provision of youth welfare services, including work-release programs, and community service activities.\n\nPrisons Division\n\nThe Prisons Division had been initially established under the Social Welfare Act 1960 to carry out two main functions:\n\n to control and supervise all persons imprisoned or detained in any gaol\n to assist in the rehabilitation into the community of all persons released or discharged from any gaol.\n\nFollowing the reconstitution of the Social Welfare Branch as the Social Welfare Department under the Social Welfare Act 1970 (No.8089) the Prisons Division became responsible for two new functions:\n\n to provide welfare services to prisoners and their families\n to assist and promote co-operation between organizations and Government departments concerned with the welfare and aftercare of prisoners.\n\nThese new functions saw the Division provide additional support services for prisoners and their families.\n\nThe Division also became responsible for work release programs in 1975 and for the control of attendance centres, which were progressively opened from 1976 and offered an alternative to full-time imprisonment. These services, together with the employment of social workers to service all prisons, reflected a redefinition of Government policy to include non-custodial correctional services and a greater emphasis on rehabilitation.\n\nWhen the Prisons Division ceased operation in January 1979 with the proclamation of the Community Welfare Services Act 1978 (No.9248), the Correctional Services Division of the new Department of Community Welfare Services assumed responsibility for its functions.\n\nFor further information about the administration of prisons and correctional services, see also VRG 9 Prisons and Youth Training Centres and VRG 93 Corrections.\n\nProbation and Parole Division\n\nThis Division was responsible for the central administration of adult and youth probation and parole services, in conjunction with the Adult Parole Board and the Youth Parole Board, for Children's Court probation services and for the provision of these services in the inner-metropolitan district. Provision of these services in country and outer-metropolitan regions was increasingly undertaken by the Regional Services Division.\n\nRegional Services Division\n\nFrom the establishment of the Department in 1971, increasingly greater emphasis was placed on the regionalisation of social welfare services. This Division became responsible for the provision of many social welfare services in country and metropolitan areas emphasizing the planning and development of community services at a regional and local level. In particular this Division became responsible for the provision of probation and parole services and (from 1976) for the administration of the foster care programme.\n\nResearch and Statistics Division\n\nThis Division collated departmental statistics and undertook research projects related to social welfare matters.\n\nTraining Division\n\nThis Division was responsible for the provision of in-service, pre-service, and volunteer training programmes for prison, child care, youth and family welfare workers.\n\nEstablishment of the Community Welfare Services Department\n\nUnder provisions of the Community Welfare Services Act 1978 the Social Welfare Department became known, in 1979, as the Department of Community Welfare Services and all functions of the former Department were assumed by the new Department.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nFor records of the Social Welfare Department see the List of Holdings 2nd edition 1985, section 3.5.1 (Department of Community Services). Researchers are also advised to consult sections 3.4.7 (Prisons Division), 3.4.8 (Adult Parole Board), 3.5.6 (Youth Parole Board), 8.0.0 (Health and Welfare Agencies) and 13.0.0 (Prisons and Youth Training Centres).

In Victoria, this committee was set up by the Deputy Premier and Minister of Education (Mr Lindsay Thompson) to complement the national enquiry. The Enquiry was chaired by Mr Justice Asche of the Family Court of Australia assisted by a Committee of 19 other members drawn from teacher training institutions, principals of schools and representatives of the teacher unions.\n\nFunctions\n\nThe primary term of reference of the Committee was to:\n\nreport on present methods and procedures in teacher education and to make recommendations on any changes which might assist in improved teaching and learning\n\nAttention was to be paid to the differences in practice amongst Australian states and territories and consider the objectives of education for 25 years in the future. In particular, the Committee were directed to consider the selection of potential teachers, pre-service programs, in-service eduction and the development of teachers and teacher education and institutions."

    "title": "Turana Youth Training Centre (previously known as Turana Reception Centre 1955-1968; Turana Juvenile School 1957-1962)",
    "description": "Early years\n\nIn 1955, \"Turana\", the Aboriginal word for 'rainbow', was established as a reception centre, children's home and juvenile school, for both boys and girls at 900 Park Street, Parkville. Previously, the site was the Royal Park Industrial School and later Royal Park Receiving Depot / Boys' and Girls' Depots, Royal Park.\n\nTurana was established under the Children's Welfare Act 1954, that abolished the Department for Reformatory Schools, Chief Secretary's Department (VA 2963), and transferred the responsibility for juvenile offenders and reformatory schools (from 1954 known as juvenile schools), to the Children's Welfare Department.\n\nTurana housed both state wards held in protective custody as well as sentenced offenders. Annually, more than 3000 children and young people were held at Turana.\n\nIn the annual report for 1955, the Secretary reported that overcrowding was a serious problem at Turana. It was particularly difficult to place babies and school children, family groups, 'problem' school-age boys, as well as children with health problems and physical or intellectual disabilities.\n\nTurana accommodated boys and girls of all ages, from a few days old to 18 or 19 years. In 1955, the facility held a weekly average of 204 children, and was considered overcrowded at the time. Turana was highly-structured with rostered staff and clear procedures to receive, assess, house and monitor children 24 hours a day.\n\n In 1956, Winlaton Youth Training Centre (VA 5093) opened and girls aged 14 years and older left Turana. By 1957, Turana had 14 separate sections and a capacity of 265. Overcrowding continued, and it was not unusual for Turana to have more than 300 children and young people at a time. By 1958, Poplar House (originally built to house 'problem girls' at Turana), had become a juvenile school for male offenders.\n\nTurana in the 1960s - 70s\n\nUntil 1960, Turana housed 64 boys aged 10 to 14 years in the Family Welfare Division's Reception Centre (Billabong) and Classifaction Centre (Parkside).\n\nOn 1 July 1961, under the Social Welfare Act 1960, two of the divisions in the newly established Social Welfare Branch took control of the juvenile schools and reception centres. The control of reception centres came under the new Family Welfare Division and the control of juvenile schools under the new Youth Welfare Division. Under this Act the juvenile schools were renamed \"Youth Training Centres\", and were formally appointed as such by the Governor in Council. The renaming of the former juvenile schools was gazetted on the 9 May 1962.\n\nOn 1 July 1961, the Allambie Reception Centre (VA 5033). opened in Burwood to relieve overcrowding at Turana.\n\nIn June 1962, a procedure was agreed upon between the Director of Youth Welfare and the Director of Family Welfare regarding the admission of Wards to Turana. Boys of 14 years and older would be accepted and dealt with by Youth Welfare Division if they were (a) Wards and non-wards brought to Turana on Police charges; (b) non-wards brought to Turana on protection applications.\n\nAll boys under 14 years - wards or non-wards - whether brought to Turana on Police charges or protection applications, would be accepted and dealt with by the Family Welfare Division.\n\nFamily Welfare Division boys whom were exceptionally difficult could be accepted into the Annexe by Youth Welfare Division up to a maximum of nine boys. The subsequent placement of such boys would be arranged by the Family Welfare Division.\n\nAll boys of 14 years or over returned from Court, admitted as in need of care and protection or likely to lapse or, alternatively returned under the provisions of Section 30 of the Children's Court Act, were to be accepted by Youth Welfare Division and classified by the Youth Welfare Classification Committee. The only boys among those whom would be returned to Family Welfare Division would be those whom were considered to be appropriate for placement at Tally Ho under the agreement previously reached between the Director of Youth Welfare and the Director of Family Welfare.\n\nOn 2 May 1962, under the powers conferred by the Social Welfare Act 1960, His Excellency the Governor of the State of Victoria appointed Parkside, being a portion of the institution known as Turana, to be a Remand Centre. (Government Gazette 9 May 1962).\n\nIn 1964 when the Allambie Reception centre nursery commenced operations, the nursery atTurana was closed and was converted to house older children.\n\nIn 1965, a new Classification Centre separated younger boys (14 to 16 years) from young men (17 to 20 years).\n\nIn October 1968, the Baltara Reception Centre was established on the site of the former Parkside section of Turana. The Baltara Reception Centre also incorporated three other new sections, Kinta, Mawarra and Warrina. The reception centre provided accomodation for boys aged from 10 - 14 years and operated as a separate entity to the rest of the Turana complex, which housed the older youths and young men (14 - 20 years).\n\nFrom the 1960s, the government continued to establish state-run reception centres, youth training centres and children's homes in metropolitan and regional Victoria. This was partly an effort to ease the overcrowding at Turana, as well as to provide institutions appropriate to the varying circumstances and needs of children and young people coming into care.\n\nBoth Baltara Youth Reception Centre and Turana Youth Training Centre still accommodated wards of the state as well as young people remanded or sentenced for criminal matters.\n\nTurana in the 1970s and '80s\n\nThe Turana Youth Training Centre's program and services grew during the 1970s.\n\nBy 1979:\nTurana's three security sections (remand, assessment and classification) held about 100 boys.\nThe training centre's three secure, open sections held 80 to 100 boys.\n\nFollowing introduction of community-based alternatives, Turana's high numbers dramatically declined.\n\nIn 1985, all statewide youth and child welfare facilities were redeveloped to reduce the role of central institutions. Turana, Winlaton and Malmsbury now operated solely as youth training centres for young people sentenced to detention.\n\nThe Children and Young Persons Act 1989 required that the provision of services for children and young people on protective orders be separated from those provided to young offenders in custody. The Act established different divisions in the Children's Court to completely separate child protection matters from criminal custodial matters.\n\nAs a result, young people under state guardianship were no longer accommodated at Turana.\n\n\nTurana in the final years\n\nIn the early 1990s, Turana was structured around five separate sections - Remand, Class A secure classification, Coolibah medium-security, Quamby open section, and Poplar House maximum security.\n- Remand had capacity for 15 boys 15-17 years awaiting court appearances.\n- Class A, the adult facility, accommodated young men 17-21 years (adult trainees).\n- Coolibah (medium security) held trainees in the final phase of their sentences.\n- Quamby (open) held adolescents in a less-restricted environment heading for release.\n- Poplar House (maximum security) held offenders.\n\nVictoria operated a unique 'dual-track system'. Some young men aged 17 years or over received prison sentences, depending on the severity of their offences or their likelihood of benefiting from serving in a youth training centre.\n\nIn late 1993 the Turana Youth Training Centre closed and the young people were transferred to the newly constructed Melbourne Juvenile Justice Centre complex built on the same site, with four 15-bed accommodation units, a program and recreation facility, and a reception area within a secure perimeter.\n\nThe Melbourne Juvenile Justice Centre(VA 5086) was fully operational by April 1994.\n\nLegislation and record keeping\n\nThe Children and Young Persons Act 1989 required that the provision of services for children and young people on protective orders be separated from those provided to young offenders in custody. The Act established different divisions in the Children's Court to completely separate child protection matters from criminal custodial matters.\n\nThe Children and Young Persons Act 1989 Act also established the term 'children in need of protection', replacing old terms 'ward of state' (from the Neglected Children's Act 1887) and 'trainee' (from the Social Welfare Act 1960). Children and young people involved with child protection and sentenced young people are now all classified as 'clients'.\n\nYoung people who entered the youth justice system before the 1989 Act was implemented, kept their trainee case history files, but not the later Client Relationship Information System institutional files (JJ CRIS prefix). This explains why the older records continued until the late 1990s - well after the terminology had changed.\n\nThe term 'client' is still used for all care leavers in Victoria."

    "description": "Prior to the establishment of the Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages in 1986, effective responsibility for the registration of births, deaths and marriages was held by the Assistant Government Statist (Chief Registration Officer), although legislative responsibility was held by the Government Statist. In 1983, the Government Statist and Actuary (VA 989) was transferred to the Department of Management and Budget (VA 1022) but operational responsibility for births, deaths and marriages remained with the Department of Property and Services (VA 430).\n\nWith the proclamation of the Registration of Births, Deaths and Marriages (Amendment) Act 1985 (No. 10244) on 31 October 1986, legislative responsibility was transferred to the Registrar of Births, Deaths, Marriages and the Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages was formally established. Services in relation to marriage are undertaken under delegation from the Federal Government pursuant to the Commonwealth Marriage Act 1961, and include a register of ministers and celebrants authorised to conduct marriage ceremonies, as well as powers in relation to the marriage of minors.\n\nAt its establishment, the Registry was part of the Department of Property and Services (VA 430). Administration of the Registration of Births, Deaths and Marriages Act 1959 was undertaken by the Minister for Property and Services (VRG 69). When the Department of Property and Services was abolished in 1991, the Registry was transferred to the Attorney-General's Department (VA 2825), and the Act was administered by the Attorney-General.\n\nFollowing the election of the Kennett Government in 1992, the Attorney-General's Department was abolished. Under Administrative Arrangements No. 114, all functions of this department were transferred to the Department of Justice (VA 3085), including the Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages. This transfer was published in the Victorian Government Gazette No. S 53, on 9 October 1992.\n\nOn 26 November 1996, the Births, Deaths and Marriages Registration Act 1996 (43/1996) was proclaimed. This Act repealed the earlier Registration of Births, Deaths and Marriages Act 1959. The new Act updated the regulations regarding registration of births, deaths, marriages and adoptions in Victoria.\n\nThe Registry remained in the Department of Justice, reporting to the Attorney-General, until 2002. Following the re-election of the Bracks Government in December 2002, the Registry was transferred to the Department of Victorian Communities (VA 4562) under Administrative Arrangements Order No. 183 (Victorian Government Gazette No S 252, 30 December 2002). The Births, Deaths and Marriages Registration Act 1996 was assigned to the Minister for Victorian Communities. However, following the 2006 state election, the Registry was moved back into the Department of Justice (VA 3085) and became the responsibility of the Attorney-General. This was published in the Victorian Government Gazette No S 317, on 5 December 2006, as part of Administrative Arrangements Order 192.\n\nFunctions\nThe Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages maintains records of all births, deaths, marriages, stillbirths, adoptions, legitimations and instruments of paternity which have occurred in Victoria since 1853. It now also has responsibility for the early Church Records form 1837 - 1853 which are the only source of births and deaths information for that period.\n\nThe Registry must also provide certificates for births, deaths, marriages and adoptions of people in Victoria; provide a legal basis for people who were born or reside in Victoria to change their name; collect and disseminate statistical data for government and other organisations; and perform civil marriages.\n\nHistory of Births, Deaths and Marriages Registration\nCompulsory registration was first introduced in 1853 (see the Act 16 Vic., No.26). The administration of the function has been the responsibility of the following Groups and Agencies:\n\n1853-1873\nVRG Colonial Secretary (to 1855) VRG 26 Chief Secretary (to 1869)\nVA 2889 Registrar-General's Department\n\n1873-1893\nVRG 19 Law (to 1893)\nVA 862 Office of the Registrar-General and the Office of Titles\n\n1893-1983\nVRG 26 Chief Secretary (to 1979) VRG 69 Property and Services (from 1979)\nVA 989 Office of Government Statist and Actuary."

    "description": "Establishment\n\nThe Electricity Commissioners were constituted in 1919 under the provisions of the Electricity Commissioners Act 1918 (No.2996) and became the State Electricity Commission of Victoria (S.E.C.) under the provisions of the State Electricity Commission Act 1920 (No.3104).\n\nThe Electricity Commissioners assumed responsibility for the administration of the Electric Light and Power Act from the Public Works Department (VA 669).\n\nPowers and Functions of the S.E.C.\n\nThe State Electricity Commission was required:\n\n\\* to inquire into and report to the Government on the measures which should be taken to achieve the ultimate co-ordination and amalgamation of all electrical undertakings in Victoria, and to secure the efficient inter-connection of such undertakings by the adoption of necessary standards of plant and equipment and system frequency and pressure\n\\* to encourage and promote the use of electricity for industrial and manufacturing purposes and to report to the Government on the prospects of establishing new industries requiring large quantities of electrical energy\n\\* to carry out investigations to ascertain the extent of coal deposits or of water power suitable for use in connection with the generation of electricity\n\\* to carry out investigations as to the safety and most economical means of improving the generation, distribution, supply and use of electricity throughout Victoria.\n\nThe Commission was vested with the following powers in relation to electrical undertakings;\n\n\\* to construct, maintain and operate electrical undertakings\n\\* to supply electricity in bulk to any statutory corporation or undertaking such as municipalities\n\\* to supply electricity to any person outside any area in which there is an existing undertaking and to Government departments and institutions\n\\* to carry on any business associated with an electrical undertaking\n\\* to make regulations as to precautions to be adopted in the use of electricity and to arrange for the licensing of electric wiremen\n\\* to develop brown coal mining and briquette manufacture\n\\* to develop hydro-electric resources\n\\* to register contractors, control installation methods and materials, and\n\\* test and trade in approved electrical equipment and appliances.\n\nThe Commission was a self supporting business which finances its capital works program and meets its operating expenses solely through revenue received from its customers and repayable loans.\n\nAcquisition of Electrical Undertakings\n\nThe Commission gradually acquired a number of electrical undertakings previously owned by companies, municipalities and the Victorian Railways. Between 1922 and 1953 the Commission acquired control of the following undertakings:\n\n\\* North Melbourne Tramways and Lighting Company in 1922\n\\* Melbourne Electric Supply Company in 1930\n\\* The Electric Supply Company of Victoria in 1934\n\\* Newport B Power Station from Victorian Railways in 1939\n\\* Melbourne City Council Spencer Street Power Station in 1941\n\\* Newport A Power Station from Victorian Railways in 1951\n\\* Mildura Electrical Undertaking in 1953\n\nThe S.E.C. continued to provide bulk supply electricity to certain metropolitan municipalities which then supply their customers.\n\nTramways\n\nIn 1930 the S.E.C. acquired the Geelong Tramways from the Melbourne Electric Supply Company and in 1934 the Commission acquired the Ballarat and Bendigo Tramways from the Electric Supply Company of Victoria. The Commission continued to operate these tramways until 1956 and 1971\\2 respectively.\n\nBrown Coal Mining\n\nIn 1917 the Government had appointed a Brown Coal Advisory Committee to investigate and report on the commercial utilization of brown coal with particular reference to the generation of electricity. In their annual report of 30 June 1920, the Commissioners reported that land had been acquired near Morwell and that progress had been made on the development of brown coal mining. By 1921 open cut mining operations had commenced and by 1924 electricity was being generated from the Yallourn Power Station and supplied to Melbourne.\n\nYallourn\n\nAs part of its development of brown coal resources, the S.E.C. began building the township of Yallourn in the 1920s. The Commission administered the town alone until 1947 when a Town Advisory Council was established. In 1968 the S.E.C. decided to demolish the town to make way for further mining and, despite opposition, by 1982\\3 the demolition was complete.\n\nHydro-Electric Schemes\n\nOne of the initial responsibilities of the Electricity Commissioners was to report on the feasibility of using water power for the generation of electricity. Government approval for the Sugarloaf-Rubicon Scheme was given in 1922 and the Rubicon and Mt Sugarloaf hydro-electric stations were in service by 1928 and 1929 and the Eildon station by 1956. Work on the Kiewa Scheme was not commenced until 1939 and the first power station was in operation by 1944. A Commonwealth-State Conference on the use of the Snowy River was convened in 1946 and subsequently the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Authority was established in 1949. The Snowy Mountain Hydro-Electric Agreements were ratified by Parliament in 1958 and electricity from the Snowy Scheme was first transmitted to Victoria in 1959.\n\nRestructuring of the Victorian Electricity Industry\n\nIn 1993-1994 the State Electricity Commission of Victoria was disaggregated into three entities, covering mining and generation; transmission and system security; and distribution and retailing.\n\nThe Electricity Industry Act 1993 (No. 130/1993) was the basis for implementing the government's objectives with regard to the structure and regulation of the Victorian electricity industry.\n\nUnder the provision of the Electricity Industry Act 1993, the following three electricity corporations were established:\n1. Generation Victoria (GV)\n2. National Electricity (NE)\n3. Electricity Services Victoria (ESV)\n\n1. Generation Victoria:\nThe Act defined the functions of Generation Victoria as:\n\n\\* To undertake the generation and supply of electricity\n\\* To explore for, mine, produce and supply coal, gas and other raw products used in the generation of electricity\n\\* To acquire and trade in electricity, coal, gas and other raw products used in the generation of electricity\n\\* To undertake the construction and operation of power stations\n\\* To carry out research and development relating to the performance of the functions\n\\* To provide services, including management services, in the coal, gas and electricity generation industries.\n\n2. National Electricity:\nThe Act defined the functions of National Electricity as:\n\n\\* To provide for the transmission of electricity in Victoria\n\\* To plan, operate, and maintain the electricity transmission system for Victoria\n\nNational Electricity may:\n\\* Coordinate the operation of the generation, transmission and distribution facilities of the Victorian electricity supply system\n\\* Acquire and trade in electricity\n\\* Operate and administer the market for the wholesale trading of electricity\n\\* Operate, manage and maintain hydro-electric power stations; and\n\\* Undertake the transmission of electricity outside Victoria\n\n3. Electricity Services Victoria (ESV):\n\nFunctions and powers of ESV as defined by the Act were:\n\\* To acquire, distribute and supply electricity\n\\* To provide services, including management services in connection with the distribution and supply of electricity\n\\* To carry on the business of trading in electrical apparatus\n\nThe functions of the Administrator of the SECV II (VA 4086) established under the Electricity Industry Act were:\n\\* To administer the residual functions and powers not conferred on any other bodies defined in the relevant Acts\n\\* To make rules for, or with respect to, trading in electricity, as between two or more of the Electricity Corporations, the SEC and the proclaimed bodies.\n\nThe Office of the Chief Electrical Inspector (VA 4207) was also created as a separate entity under the Electricity Industry Act.\n\nFurther changes to the structure (1994)\n\nAn independent distribution company, PoolCo (Victorian Power Exchange), was established to monitor and control the wholesale electricity market and ensure the security of the supply system. The Company was granted the wholesale electricity market licence.\n\nPower Net Victoria, a transmission grid company which owned, maintained and managed the high voltage grid, was granted the transmission licence by the Regulator General under sections 162 and 168 of the Electricity Industry Act 1993.\n\nGeneration Victoria, an interim structure, was reviewed and restructured into five independent generating companies. Hazelwood Power Corporation Pty Ltd comprised the Hazlewood power station and the Morewell brown coal mine; Loy Yang Power Pty Ltd comprised the Loy Yang A power station and the Loy Yang mine; Southern Hydro Pty Ltd covered hydro power stations at Kiewa, Dartmouth, Eildon/Rubicon and Cairn Curran; and Yallourn Energy Pty Ltd comprised Yallourn W power station and the Yallourn mine. In the interim, Generation Victoria was to continue and to be responsible for the gas-powered power stations.\n\nElectricity Services Victoria was also further divided into five companies, each responsible for the customer service for one of five regions: Eastern, Western and three Metropolitan regions. Distribution and retail licences were issued to Eastern Energy Ltd, Citipower Ltd, Solaris Power Ltd, United Energy Ltd and Powercor Australia Ltd.\n\nThe Office of the Regulator General Act 1994 (No. 42/1994) established the Office as an independent regulator of the electricity and other industries: to protect and consumer, monitor and maintain the integrity of supply and ensure the market operated fairly. The Office exercised its regulatory powers with respect to:\n\\* Standards and condition of service and supply\n\\* Licensing\n\\* Market conditions; and\n\\* Other economic regulatory matters.\n\nMinisterial Responsibility\n\nThe Ministers responsible for the State Electricity Commission were:\n\n Attorney General 1919-1927\n Minister in Charge of Electrical Undertakings 1927-1955\n Minister of Electrical Undertakings 1955-1965\n Minister of Fuel and Power 1965-1977\n Minister for Minerals and Energy 1977-1985\n Minister for Industry, Technology and Resources 1985-1992\n Minister for Energy and Minerals 1992-1993\n\nFrom at least 1965-1993, there was a Department of State responsible for co-ordination of and liaison with the major energy agencies including the State Electricity Commission and the Gas and Fuel Corporation (VA 1040) The Departments responsible since 1965 have been:\n\nMinistry of Fuel and Power (VA 627) 1965-1977,\nDepartment of Minerals and Energy (VA 611) 1977-1985,\nDepartment of Industry, Technology and Resources (VA 2661) 1985-1992,\nDepartment of Energy and Minerals (VA 3035) 1992-1995,\nDepartment of Agriculture, Energy and Minerals (VA 3744) 1995-1996\n\nOfficial History of State Electricity Commission of Victoria\n\nAn official history of the Commission was published in 1969:\n EDWARDS, Cecil.

As early as 1848 tenders were called for the construction of a gaol. The gaol was designed by Henry Ginn and officially opened in 1854.\n\nBy 1874 it was noted that the Gaol was being used to some extent as an invalid depot. In 1914 the prison was considered as the 'hospital gaol of the State', receiving male criminal invalids from Pentridge and other gaols. In 1924 part of the gaol was apparently proclaimed as a reformatory prison under the Indeterminate Sentences Act 1908, although this could not be confirmed by the Victorian Government Gazette.\n\nIn 1939 the gaol was evidently transferred to the Commonwealth for use as a Military Gaol. From 5 February 1947 the institution was re-proclaimed as 'H.M. Gaol, Geelong' for use by the State of Victoria. On 26 April 1972 the gaol was proclaimed as 'Her Majesty's Training Prison, Geelong' under provisions within Part IV of the Social Welfare Act 1970.\n\nBy 1990, the Geelong Prison was operating as a medium security prison with a minimum security annexe.\n\nGeelong Prison closed in 1991 after the opening of the maximum security prison Barwon the previous year."

    "title": "Melbourne Water Corporation [known as Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works to 1992]",
    "description": "BACKGROUND\n\nFour main systems (Yan Yean, Maroondah, O'Shannassy, and Upper Yarra) supply Melbourne with water. The first of these (Yan Yean) was inaugurated in the 1850's. Responsibility for urban water supply and sewerage originally belonged with the City of Melbourne (1842 to date). In 1853 it was passed to the Commissioners of Sewers and Water Supply (1853-1860), thence to the Public Works Department, and finally to the Melbourne & Metropolitan Board of Works (1891 to date) now known as Melbourne Water.\n\nHistorically, sewerage lagged behind water supply and the inability of the early water authorities to deal effectively with sewerage problems was a major factor in the establishment of the Board in 1891. Only in the second half of the twentieth century did the supply of sewerage to newly settled areas become nearly simultaneous with water supply. In 1923, the M.M.B.W. was made responsible for drainage (main drains, rivers, creeks, surface water, storm water and floods). A major ancillary function has been the survey and mapping of urban and catchment areas under the Board's control. Diverse other responsibilities associated with water have included -\n\n management of catchment areas,\n\n management of parks and reserves in drainage areas,\n\n management of industrial and hazardous wastes,\n\n maintenance of metropolitan highways and bridges (1956 to 1974),\n\n foreshore protection and improvements (1956 to 1974).\n\nFrom 1949 to 1985, the M.M.B.W. was the chief planning authority for metropolitan Melbourne. In the early 1970s, \"the Board had become a delegated agency for the EPA [Environmental Protection Authority] in detecting, licensing and monitoring waste discharges\" (Tony Dingle & Carolyn Rasmussen, Vital Connections 1991, p.307). Late in 1985, legislation gave the M.M.B.W. responsibility for the storage treatment and disposal of industrial water throughout the whole of Victoria.\n\nPERIOD OF FIRST SETTLEMENT TO 1860\n: CITY OF MELBOURNE & COMMISSIONERS OF SEWERS & WATER SUPPLY\n\nFrom its establishment in 1836, Melbourne drew its water supply direct from the Yarra River. As the population grew, this became hazardous to public health. The City of Melbourne (VA 511), established 1842, had formal responsibility for water supply and sewerage but lacked the necessary finance to construct its own water supply and sewers works.\n\nIn 1853 the colonial government established the Commissioners of Sewers & Water Supply (VA 2802) to take control of water supply functions. Works were undertaken by the Sewerage and Water (Supply) Commission whose staff were part of the civil establishment of the colony, responsible to the Commissioner of Public Works and effectively part of the Public Works Department (VA 669). The Commissioners built the Yan Yean water supply but \"shied away from building the more difficult and costly sewers\" (Tony Dingle & Carolyn Rasmussen, Vital Connections M.M.B.W., 1991, p.18). Initially these works were financed by an advance from the Colonial Treasurer to be repaid within a period of twenty five years. The Water Works Debenture Act 1855 authorised the Colonial Treasurer to issue debentures and the money raised was to be used to finance the work of the Commissioners.\n\nPERIOD FROM 1860 TO 1891\n: MELBOURNE SEWERAGE & WATER SUPPLY DEPARTMENT\n\nOn 12 December 1859, by Order of the Governor in Council and under the provisions of the Melbourne Sewerage and Water Amendment Act 1858, the Board of Commissioners of Sewerage and Water Supply was dissolved and its powers and property vested in the Board of Lands and Works (VA 744). Operationally, this responsibility was exercised by a branch of the Public Works Department known as the Melbourne Sewerage and Water Supply Department.\n\nWater supply generated a revenue surplus, but successive colonial governments were unwilling to apply it to capital works for sewerage out of fear that country voters would resent increased spending on the metropolis. This led to urban dissatisfaction at what was seen as a hidden tax on city dwellers since surplus water revenues were applied to consolidated funds. Melbourne municipal government had been kept fragmented to prevent the formation of a metropolitan power and tax base which would rival the colonial government's own. There existed, in consequence, no single municipal authority capable of discharging water supply and sewerage functions throughout the metropolitan area.\n\nThe Town Clerk of Melbourne, E.G. Fitzgibbon, was prominent amongst those urging the formation of a single body representative of municipalities on the model of London's Metropolitan Board of Works as an alternative to government control. Other municipalities, many of which feared domination by Melbourne, could not agree, however, on the basis of representation. See David Dunstan, Governing the Metropolis ... (Melbourne, 1984).\n\nAs the sanitary crisis worsened, municipal conferences continued to disagree about what should be done until, in the late 1880s, a majority agreed to support the idea of a Board of Works for Melbourne. A Royal Commission into Sanitation recommended the establishment of a Board to provide a sewerage system and to take over control of the water supply and rivers and water courses in the metropolis. The Commission recommended establishment of a small Board of experts, independent of municipal control. The municipalities, however, demanded and won government agreement to the formation of a body representative of and largely controlled by municipal interests. This pattern of control lasted until 1978, when the government resumed a large measure of control leading, in time, to the corporatisation of the Board's functions and its current break up into diverse businesses.\n\nPERIOD FROM 1891 TO 1991\n: MELBOURNE & METROPOLITAN BOARD OF WORKS (M.M.B.W.)\n\nThe Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works (M.M.B.W.) was established in 1891 under the Melbourne Metropolitan Board of Works Act 1890 (No.1197) which received Royal Assent on 20 December 1890. The Board held its first meeting on 18 March 1891, but it was not formally constituted until its proclamation by Parliament on 1 July 1891.\n\nUnder s.60 of the M.M.B.W. Act of 1890, the new Board took over from the Board of Lands and Works (VA 744) responsibility for the ownership of all Melbourne metropolitan waterworks, sewers, drains, property, land, buildings, plant, river beds and banks except for those river beds and banks vested in the Melbourne Harbour Trust Commissioners, Victorian Railways Commissioners (VA 2876) and the City of Melbourne, and for all related debts and contracts. Operational responsibility for Melbourne's water supply and sewerage was taken over from a branch of Public Works (VA 669), the Melbourne Sewerage and Water Supply Department.\n\nThe 1890 Act established a Board of thirty nine unpaid Commissioners, all drawn from Melbourne and Metropolitan Councils, and a full-time elected Chairman. Amending Acts in 1945 and 1953 increased the number of Commissioners to fifty four by 1978. Following a Board of Inquiry in 1977, the constitution of the M.M.B.W. was changed by the Melbourne Metropolitan Board of Works (Reconstruction) Act 1978 (No.9165) and from 1 August 1978 the Board comprised a full-time appointed Chairman and six part-time members (four elected by Area Commissions - groupings of municipalities - and two Government appointees: Victorian Yearbook 1980, p.304). The Board also worked through a number of permanent Committees - Officers and Servants, Finance, Water Supply, Sewerage, Farm, as well as Planning and Highways 1956-1974 and Planning 1974-1985. The Melbourne Metropolitan Board of Works (Offices) Act 1982 instituted senior management reforms including a change in the status of Chairman from full to part-time and the appointment of a General Manager.\n\nE.G. Fitzgibbon became the Board's first Chairman. In late 1890 an English sanitary engineer, James Mansergh, visited Melbourne to provide recommendations on the development of a sewerage system. His recommendations have guided the subsequent history of Melbourne's systems (M.M.B.W. 75th Anniversary and Annual Report, 1965-1966). Over time, the M.M.B.W. subsumed water authorities in surrounding areas which were progressively swallowed up in Melbourne's urban sprawl.\n\nPERIOD FROM 1991 TO DATE\n: MELBOURNE WATER\n\nMelbourne Water is the successor in law and the body responsible for the functions carried out by the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works. It was formed by the merger of the M.M.B.W. with other local water authorities on 1 September 1991. Under the Melbourne Water Corporation Act 1992 (Act No.54, 1992), which received Royal Assent on 30 June 1992, the M.M.B.W. as then constituted continues in existence under the name Melbourne Water Corporation (known as Melbourne Water). The 1992 Act does not repeal the earlier Act. Melbourne Water has the functions conferred on it by the 1992 Act, the 1891 Act (as amended) and any other Act. The Melbourne Water Corporation Act was proclaimed on 30 June 1992.\n\nUnder section 51 of the Act, Melbourne Water took over responsibilities for water supply, sewerage and drainage functions formerly undertaken by:\n\n Dandenong - Springvale Water Board;\n\n Emerald District Water Board;\n\n Dandenong Valley and Westernport Authority;\n\n Mornington Peninsula and District Water Board;\n\n Pakenham Water Board and the\n\n Lang Lang Water Board\n\nin the geographic areas formerly administered by these bodies.\n\nMelbourne Water also has responsibility for development of metropolitan waterways and parks and the management of Victoria's industrial wastes. Major initiatives as at February 1993 included the construction of the North West Sewer, continued expansion of open space, improvement of waterways and implementation of customer services programs. Melbourne Water has three regional offices in metropolitan Melbourne to increase its capacity to respond quickly to the concerns of customers, local government and trades people.\n\nDuring 1992, Melbourne Water Corporation was administered by a Commissioner. From 1993, the corporation will be administered by a Board of Directors with a maximum of six members (Part 3 of the 1992 Act).\n\nWATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE FUNCTIONS\n\nThe M.M.B.W. took over the Yan Yean Reservoir (constructed 1857) and subsequently constructed a number of major storage reservoirs - Toorourrong- Maroondah (1927), O'Shannassy (1928), Silvan (1931), Upper Yarra (1957), Cardinia and Winneke. These reservoirs are linked to a number of metropolitan service reservoirs. The Werribee Treatment Farm and pumping station at Spotswood formed part of the original sewerage scheme developed by the Board. The Brooklyn pumping station began operation in 1964 and in the same year construction of the South Eastern Scheme began (Melbourne Metropolitan Board of Works Annual Report 1965-1966).\n\nMAIN DRAINS AND STORM WATER FUNCTIONS\n\nThe M.M.B.W.'s responsibility for rivers, creeks, drains, surface water, and flood control was made definite in 1923 by the Metropolitan Drainage and Rivers Act which vested responsibility in the Board for the drainage of surface water and rainwater flowing through more than one municipality. Later amendments extended the Board's responsibilities and the provisions of these Acts were consolidated in the 1958 Melbourne Metropolitan Board of Works Act. At first, efforts were concentrated on the mana... truncated"

The Victoria Government Gazette No.102, 13 October 1982, provides the following listing of functional responsibilities:\n\n\\* to participate in the development of advice to Government on policies and priorities and to manage the budgetary process to ensure that the allocation of resources is integrated with both the programme priorities and the economic goals of the Government;\n\n\\* to provide a focus for the development of improved approaches to financial management throughout public administration in Victoria;\n\n\\* to develop a strengthened financial budgeting and control system which includes departments and public authorities, allows decision-making freedom for agency management, embraces all resource requirements, is linked to the programme priorities of Government and is monitored through a management control system;\n\n\\* to advise and assist agencies in matters of resource policy and resource management;\n\n\\* to provide advice to Government on various revenue options, taxes, stamp duties, charges and royalties, and to manage the collection of such revenues;\n\n\\* to maintain the liquidity of overall Government operations, to monitor detailed cash flows throughout the year, and to advise Government of any necessary action;\n\n\\* to manage centralised Government investments in accordance with overall Government policies and priorities;\n\n\\* to advise on and, where necessary, manage the financial assets of both departments and public authorities so as to protect the interests of, and maximise the return to the State;\n\n\\* to ensure that Government expenditures are properly authorized by Parliament and reported to Parliament;\n\n\\* to provide advice to Government on the resource impact of various proposals, including proposals considered off-budget;\n\n\\* to co-ordinate the financial management, economic policy and budgetary requirements of Government. To advise the Government, through the Economic Committee of Cabinet, on short, medium and long term economic and financial objectives and priorities and continuously evaluate and review these objectives and priorities. To monitor and co-ordinate the efforts of departments and public authorities to implement such policies;\n\n\\* to set budgetary parameters and financial and economic management standards for departments and public authorities and continuously evaluate and review project, program and management effectiveness;\n\n\\* to set accounting standards to be met by both departments and public authorities;\n\n\\* to monitor performance against budget, and program achievement. To report to Government on the performance of agencies in the delivery of agreed programs within agreed budgets; and\n\n\\* to advise Government on the financial and economic aspects of inter-governmental relations and to ensure that such matters are fully integrated with the budgetary process.\n\nLand Monitoring\n\nFrom 1978/79 until 1985 the Department of Property and Services (VA 430) had responsibility for the function of monitoring government land sales. This function was inherited by the Treasurer in 1985 and was the responsibility of the Land Monitoring Division of the Department of Management and Budget (VA 1022) until it was transferred to the Department of Planning and Urban Growth (VA 3006) in early 1990. In 1991 the function was transferred back to the Department of the Treasury (VA 3007) and remained with this agency until it was transferred to the Department of Finance (VA 3016) after the October 1992 election. In mid 1993 responsibility for land monitoring was transferred to the Department of Planning and Development (VA 3094).\n\nBackground\n\nAll purchases and sales of properties by Government of $100,000 or more require Land Monitoring approval to ensure that all Government requirements under the Land Acquisition and Compensation Act 1986 in relation to property transactions are met. The function was established to provide Government with an independent safeguard against further land dealings of the type criticised at the Gowans Board of Enquiry and later at the Frost Royal Commission. This function is completely separate from the budgeting and planning functions in relation to government real estate. The function encompasses:\n\n\\* monitoring all purchases and sales of properties by Government of $100,000 including assessing submissions from agencies and monitoring of auctions.\n\n\\* the development of policies for the management of government real estate\n\\* assisting in identifying properties that are surplus to current needs. Administering the Government's decision in relation to the disposal of surplus railway land.\n\nAssociated Authorities\n\nA number of large statutory authorities with finance authorities are closely associated with the Department as part of the Treasurer's portfolio, including the State Bank (VA 1041), State Insurance Office (VA 1033), the Stamp Duties Office, State Tender Board and the Rural Finance Corporation (VA 2985). Authorities responsible for superannuation and pension schemes for public servants, railway employees, teachers and other government employees are also grouped in the Treasurer's portfolio together with the State Taxation Office and agencies responsible for workers compensation, statistics and actuarial functions and land monitoring. From 1985 to 1988 the Motor Accidents Board (VA 1055), from 1986 Traffic Accident Commission (VA 2892), was also part of the Treasurer's portfolio and hence was closely associated with the Department. The registration of friendly societies (1982-1987) and of real estate agents has also been associated with the Department.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nSignificant records of the Department's predecessor, the Department of the Treasurer (VA 865) are held at Public Record Office Victoria.\n\nSee also List of Holdings 2nd edition 1985, section 3.22.1"

    "description": "Establishment\n\nThe Ministry for Planning and Environment was established on 1 September 1983. With the establishment of the Ministry further co-ordination of government regulation of land use was achieved as functions relating to environment protection, heritage protection including archaeological survey, Crown land planning and coastal management (both within and without Port Phillip Bay) were administered along with the general land planning functions the Ministry inherited from the Department of Planning (VA 599).\n\nIn 1985 the Ministry also assumed responsibility for the control and development of building regulations and for the Plumbers and Gasfitters Board. At the same time responsibility for the Landata function, established in 1982 in the previous Department of Planning, was transferred to the Department of Property and Services (VA 430). In the same year the broader coastal management function was transferred to the Department of Conservation, Forests and Lands (VA 1034).\n\nIn April 1990 the Ministry was abolished and its main planning functions transferred to the Department of Planning and Urban Growth (VA 3006). Responsibility for environment effects statements, building regulation, and heritage protection was also transferred to the Department of Planning and Urban Growth (VA 3006). The following \"heritage\" and \"environment\" functions were transferred to the Department of Conservation and Environment (VA 3004): protection of historic buildings, National Estate and environment protection (policy and planning).\n\nFunctions\n\nThe prime focus of the Ministry was managing and controlling the use of land, safeguarding and improving the environment and protecting the heritage of Victoria.\n\nOverview of Planning Functions\n\nThe State Government became involved with land use planning in the 1920s in response to pressure from town planners for improved land use and better co-ordination of services. Municipalities were given power to zone land for residential use in 1921. The Metropolitan Town Planning Commission (VA 3131) (est. 1922) recommended development of planning schemes with statutory force to be administered by municipalities. Little was done, however, to implement these proposals during the depression of the 1930s.\n\nPrior to the Second World War, the Victorian Housing Commission (VA 508) was empowered to require municipalities to prepare zoning plans for residential areas as part of the Commission's slum abatement programme. During the War, the Commonwealth used its control of funding for housing to pressure the States to adopt both town planning and regional strategic planning as part of postwar reconstruction.\n\nRegional planning developed into the regional development and decentralisation functions of State Development & Decentralisation (VRG 51) and was carried out through the State Regional Boundaries Committee (est. 1944) and subsequently by the Central Planning Authority (est. 1946).\n\nStatutory (town) planning began in 1944 co-ordinated by the Town & Country Planning Board (VA 516). Under this statutory regime, municipalities (singly or jointly) prepared planning schemes for approval by the Minister, and then administered the approved schemes. Interim development orders provided planning authority in areas not yet covered by a scheme. The Melbourne & Metropolitan Board of Works (VA 1007) was given responsibility for the Melbourne metropolitan planning scheme from 1949 to 1985.\n\nIn 1968, amendments were made to planning legislation which broadened the planning function to include \"strategic planning\" and introduced greater co-ordination. A three-tiered planning system was introduced. Planning schemes now operate within a framework established by State-wide Statements of Planning Policy and Regional Planning Schemes. This system, further centralised and streamlined by legislative amendments in 1987, establishes closer links with other planning mechanisms in areas such as transport, education, heritage protection, and environment protection.\n\nDevelopment of Statutory Planning Functions [Planning Schemes (to 1988)]\n\nFrom 1922 to 1929 the Metropolitan Town Planning Commission (VA 3131), financed partly by Melbourne metropolitan municipalities and partly by contributions from the Railways, Tramways, Harbour Trust, and the Board of Works, operated in an advisory and honorary capacity. Its work included research and recommendations on urban development and town planning. Its 1929 report (concerning zoning, transport, recreation, harbours and rivers, building regulation, and conservation) provided a model for those urging government to enact a statutory planning regime and for those municipalities undertaking land use zoning up to 1944.\n\nAs part of postwar reconstruction, the Commonwealth prompted the States to undertake both town and regional planning. In Victoria, town planning functions were set up on a statutory basis administered through the Town and Country Planning Board (T&CPB) (VA 516). Regional planning (cf. regional development) was carried out through the State Regional Boundaries Committee and subsequently by the Central Planning Authority.\n\nThe work of the T&CPB in the preparation, amendment, administration and enforcement of planning schemes and interim development orders included:\n\n co-ordinating and advising planning authorities responsible for developing and administering statutory planning schemes, and\n\n advising the Minister whether or not schemes and scheme amendments prepared by municipalities and other planning authorities should be approved and gazetted.\n\nMelbourne and Metropolitan Statutory Planning 1949 - 1988 [Planning Schemes (to 1988) Melbourne and Metropolitan]\n\nBecause most municipalities had failed to use their new planning powers, in 1949 the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works (VA 1007) was given the task of preparing a metropolitan planning scheme. Responsibilities transferred to the MMBW for the metropolitan area included:\n\n preparation or amendment of planning schemes and interim development orders\n\n levying of annual metropolitan improvement rate to recover expenses of planning activities\n\n administration and enforcement of the provisions or sections of the provisions of schemes including consideration and determination of planning permit applications and ensuring compliance with the planning controls and the conditions attached to planning consent\n\nThe first version of the Melbourne Metropolitan Planning Scheme (1954) was prepared by the MMBW and exhibited in 1953. The MMBW approved the scheme in 1958 but it was not until 1968 that the Minister for Local Government gazetted it as a legally enforceable document.\n\nAs a result of changes to planning legislation in 1968 the MMBW was given responsibility for statutory planning of an enlarged metropolitan area.\n\nThe 1971 amendment to the Mark I Scheme generated such widespread debate within the community that the Board re-evaluated its position and in 1974 published the Report on General Concept Objections to inform the public of its deliberations to the objections to the 1971 proposal. The Mark III plan, the Metropolitan Strategy, was presented in 1980.\n\nWhen the MMBW commenced its Mark I plan only a few local councils were engaged in scheme preparation. Local planning powers were not suspended but allowed to co-exist with those of the MMBW, leading to a complex process of land use control. In 1981 nine metropolitan municipalities had a planning scheme while 12 had Interim Development Orders, some requiring developers to apply for a permit from both local and metropolitan authorities. Gradually the MMBW negotiated with the relevant councils to reduce this duplication.\n\nIn 1979 planning legislation was amended to allow local councils to play a more clearly defined role. Subsequently municipalities were able to prepare local development schemes within broad regional guidelines. These schemes were to introduce even finer grained zoning than under the Melbourne Metropolitan Planning Scheme provided they did not conflict with it. Only one such scheme was ever approved and the local development schemes were repealed shortly thereafter.\n\nThe development control function of metropolitan statutory planning was largely delegated to local councils (around 60%) while the MMBW retained primary responsibility for permit applications concerning the boundaries of zones or reservations and for all land in certain zones, such as Rural Residential Zones, Reserved Industrial Zones and Special Conservation Zones. During the late 1970s and the 1980s local councils developed their role beyond that of making decisions in regard to planning applications for land uses and areas delegated by the MMBW.\n\nThe Development of Strategic Planning 1968 to 1988 [Planning (to 1988)]\n\nAfter the overhaul of state planning legislation in 1968 the functions undertaken by the Town and Country Planning Board were broadened to include\n\n the co-ordinated development of statewide general land use planning policies to provide effective guidance for the preparation of statutory planning schemes and co-ordination of planning mechanisms available to various government agencies and statutory authorities\n\n preparation of Statements of Planning Policy with the assistance of the State Planning Council, later the State Co-ordination Council. These bodies consisted of representatives of various service, development and conservation authorities and were to develop broad scale, strategic land use policy and produce statements of planning policy for specific areas or types of land use which when approved by the Minister and gazetted, became government policy and legally binding on both councils and regional authorities. Statements of Planning Policy which came into operation were:\n Statement of Planning Policy 1 (Westernport) 1970 (varied 1976)\n Statement of Planning Policy 2 (Mornington Peninsula) 1970\n Statement of Planning Policy 3 (Upper Yarra Valley and Dandenongs)\n 1971 (varied 1979)\n Statement of Planning Policy 4 (Yarra River) 1971 (varied 1979)\n Statement of Planning Policy 5 (Highway Areas) 1973\n Statement of Planning Policy 6 (Land Use and Aerodromes) 1973\n Statement of Planning Policy 7 (Geelong) 1973\n Statement of Planning Policy 8 (Macedon Ranges and Surrounds) 1975\n Statement of Planning Policy 9 (Central Gippsland) 1975\n\nIt was envisaged that regional planning authorities established under the post-1968 legislation would operate in most, if not all, the regions of Victoria. It was also envisaged that the Statements of Planning Policy would provide the guidelines for regional authorities to develop regional planning schemes (statutory) to be administered by local municipalities. However most of those regional planning authorities which were established were given primarily a strategic planning role rather than a statutory planning role.\n\nThe Planning and Environment Act 1987 [Planning, post 1988]\n\nAfter 1988 a more co-ordinated programme of statutory and strategic planning was conducted under the Planning and Environment Act 1987. The new legislation introduced broader heritage, urban and environment conservation planning controls into the planning process. Sections of the 1987 Act provide that all planning schemes must include provisions relating to the protection of both rural or natural area conservation and heritage and urban conservation including natural and other resources and the maintenance of ec... truncated"

    "title": "Ministry of Consumer Affairs",
    "description": "Establishment\n\nThe origins of consumer protection in Victoria are to be found in legislation relating to the labelling of goods administered by the Department of Labour and Industry. However, the Consumer Protection Act 1964 was the first specific legislation to provide protection for consumers.\n\nThe Ministry of Consumer Affairs was established under the Ministry of Consumer Affairs Act 1973 (No.8442) on 3 June 1974. to protect and promote the interests of consumers.\n\nA Minister and Director were appointed and The Ministry superseded the Consumer Protection Bureau (VA 2735). and the Consumer Affairs Council which were brought together under the umbrella of the Ministry. Two statutory authorities were also created, the Motor Car Traders Committee and the Small Claims Tribunal.\n\nBetween 1974 and 1981 the Ministry remained subordinate to the Department of Labour and Industry which controlled the Ministry's finances and personnel. In 1981 it became a Department of State in its own right.\n\nFollowing significant machinery of government changes after the election of the first Kennett Government in October 1992, the Department of Justice (VA 3085) was established. Under Administrative Arrangements Order No.114 the Department assumed most functions of the Ministry of Consumer Affairs.\n\nFunctions\n\nThe functions of the Ministry are:\n\n to protect and promote the interests of consumers\n to investigate any matter affecting such interests\n to advise and co-operate with government departments, statutory authorities and municipalities\n to initiate, promote and encourage practices for the protection of consumers\n to inform consumers of their rights and responsibilities\n to administer the Consumer Protection Act 1972\n\nResidential Tenancy\n\nThe Residential Tenancies Act 1980 (No.9514) consolidated and updated legislation relating to a wide range of tenancy matters including rents, repairs and maintenance, use and conditions of premises and the termination of leases. Prior to the commencement of the Act, the Rental Investigation Bureau, located within the Law Department (VA 864), had endeavoured to investigate and negotiate resolutions to complaints of excessive rent. Upon the establishment under the Act of the Residential Tenancies Tribunal (VA 1615) and the Residential Tenancies Bureau (within the Ministry of Consumer Affairs) the functions of the Rental Investigation Bureau were provided with a legislative basis and transferred to the Ministry of Consumer Affairs and the Tribunal. The establishment of the Residential Tenancies Tribunal also brought functions and powers previously held by Fair Rents Boards (VA 2586) for the determinations of rent of prescribed premises into the portfolio of the Minister of Consumer Affairs.\n\nWhilst the Tribunal is a statutory body which reports directly to the Minister, it works closely with the Ministry for Consumer Affairs in administering the Residential Tenancies Act. In particular, the Ministry has a role in raising public awareness of tenancy issues, in seeking to resolve disputes prior to legal action being taken and in further developing policy and legislation in relation to residential tenancy. When the Tribunal commenced operations, the Residential Tenancies Bureau was established within the Ministry to carry out these functions and provide administrative support to the Tribunal. Internal restructuring has seen the Bureau incorporated into the Ministry's Adjudication Division.\n\nSmall Claims Tribunal\n\nLike the Residential Tenancies Tribunal, the Small Claims Tribunal (VA 1616) reports upon its operations directly to the Minister for Consumer Affairs and receives administrative support from the Ministry through the Adjudication Division. It works closely with the Ministry in seeking to resolve disputes prior to recourse to adjudication and in promoting awareness of consumer rights and obligations.\n\nWeights and Measures\n\nIn 1984 the Ministry assumed responsibility for the central administration functions of the Weights and Measures Act 1958 including ensuring the accurate measurement of physical quantities in trading transactions.\n\nPrices\n\nIn 1985 responsibility for matters relating to the regulation of fuel prices was assumed by the Department of Industry, Technology and Resources (VA 2661).\n\nIn September 1989 the Minister of Consumer Affairs became responsible for the monitoring of prices and for price restraint programs carried out by the Office of Prices. The Ministry of Consumer Affairs has since that time been responsible for providing corporate services support to the Office of Prices.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nSee List of Holdings, 2nd edition 1985, section 3.7.0."

    "description": "Formation of Ethnic Affairs Commission\n\nThe Ethnic Affairs Commission was established on 9 November 1982 by the Ethnic Affairs Commission Act 1982 (No.9789). This Act repealed the Ministry of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs Act 1976 (No.8963) although the Ministry of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (VA 1042) effectively continued through to 16 February 1983 when the title of the Ministry was changed to Ministry of Ethnic Affairs. The Chairman of the Ethnic Affairs Commission became the Permanent Head of the Ministry of Ethnic Affairs on 15 March 1983.\n\nThe exact nature of the relationship between the Commission and the Ministry of Ethnic Affairs is subject to further research. The Commission comprised three full-time members (the Chairman and two deputies) and ten part-time members, none of whom could be subject to the Public Service Act 1974 (No.8656) in their capacity as Commission members. The Act, however, made provision for public servants to be appointed for \"the proper functioning of the Commission\". It is therefore evident that the Ministry of Ethnic Affairs carried out the substantive functions of the Commission as determined by the 1982 Act. For this reason the ethnic affairs function is not shown transferring to the Commission at this time.\n\nThe objects of the Ethnic Affairs Commission as stated in the Act are:\n\n- to achieve full participation of ethnic groups in the social, economic, cultural and political life of the community\n- to provide services to ethnic groups and ensure access to all other services\n- to ensure that ethnic groups can retain and express their social identity and cultural inheritance\n- to promote co-operation between agencies concerned with ethnic groups\n- to promote unity and a better understanding of ethnic groups\n- to ascertain the needs of ethnic groups.\n\nEthnic Affairs\n\nThe role of the Commission within the overall ethnic affairs function has encompassed:\n- liaison with Government departments and ethnic communities\n- consultation on ethnic affairs policies and services\n- advice on funding of activities of ethnic groups\n- holding meetings and seminars\n- reporting to the Equal Opportunity Board on matters affecting the equal opportunity of Victorian residents\n- liaison with other bodies regarding the needs of ethnic groups.\n\nRelationship to Office of Ethnic Affairs and Ethnic Affairs Unit\n\nAs part of the machinery of government changes announced by the Premier in January 1991 the \"policy development and administrative responsibilities\" of the Ethnic Affairs Commission were placed with the Office of Ethnic Affairs, established as an associated administrative unit of the Ministry of Ethnic, Municipal and Community Affairs (MEMCA)(VA 3015). As it is assumed that the Ministry of Ethnic Affairs (VA 1042) had undertaken the \"policy development and administrative responsibilities\" of the Commission, the transfer of the substantive function effectively occurred from the Ministry of Ethnic Affairs to the Office of Ethnic Affairs within MEMCA. The Ethnic Affairs Unit within the Department of the Premier and Cabinet (VA 1039) superceded the Office of Ethnic Affairs following further machinery of government changes in October 1992. It appears that both the Office of Ethnic Affairs and the current Ethnic Affairs Unit have exercised greater autonomy since these changes although they have continued to provide administrative support to the Commission. It is assumed that both these agencies, as well as the Ministry of Ethnic Affairs before them, have all maintained records created by the Commission.\n\nFrom 1996, the Commission has been known as the Victorian Multicultural Commission. The Commission is supported by the Department of Communities VA 4562 from 2002\n\nLocation of Records"

It had also been responsible for the administration of Government Advertising.\n\nBetween Federation and 1929, the Victorian Government Printing Office (VGPO) was also responsible for the provision of printing services to the Commonwealth public service and Parliament.\n\nThis agency was formed by Superintendent La Trobe in 1851.

The Ombudsman was the Chief Administrator and reports directly to both Houses of Parliament. However, the Ombudsman Act 1973 was the responsibility of the Premier.\n\nThe principle function of the Ombudsman was to enquire into or investigate any administrative action taken in any government department or public statutory body (to which the Ombudsman Act 1973 applies) or by any member of staff of a municipal council.\n\nThe jurisdiction of the Ombudsman did not extend to administrative actions taken by:\n\n- a court of law or by a judge or magistrate,\n- a person acting as legal adviser to the Crown or as counsel for the Crown in any\n proceedings,\n- a person acting in the capacity as a trustee under the Trustee Act 1958, although section 13(2A) of the Ombudsman Act allows the Ombudsman to investigate administrative action taken by State Trustees,\n- the Auditor General,\n- boards, tribunals, commissions, etc. which are constituted by a statute providing for the chair to be a lawyer (that is, they are presided over by a judge, a magistrate or a barrister or solicitor), for instance, the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT),\n- officers of the Governor of Victoria.\n\nAdditionally, unless there are special circumstances, the Office of the Ombudsman does not investigate complaints which may be appropriately decided by a court or tribunal, or are more than 12 months old.\n\n\nThe Ombudsman is empowered by the following legislation:\n\n- Ombudsman Act 1973 - provided for the appointment of an Ombudsman and Deputy Ombudsman and detailed the Ombudsman's role and functions in relation to the investigation of complaints\n\n- Ombudsman (Municipalities) Act 1976 extended the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman to local government in January 1977.\n\n- Freedom of Information Act 1982 - enabled the community to access information in the possession of government agencies and provided the Ombudsman with specific powers in relation to the investigation of FOI complaints and other functions.\n\n Freedom of Information Complaints\nThe Ombudsman had four major functions under Freedom of Information legislation. They were to:\n- hear the complaint of an applicant who was advised that a document did not exist or could not be located,\n- provide a certificate for a Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal review of charges levied for documents provided under the Freedom of Information Act stating that the matter is of sufficient importance for the Tribunal to consider,\n- provide a certificate, if appropriate, where an agency fails to make a decision on a request within a reasonable time stating that the question of the delay can be determined by the tribunal, and\n- intervene, if appropriate, at a hearing in the tribunal in relation to an appeal, following an applicant's request to do so.\n\n- Corrections Act 1986 - empowered the Ombudsman to investigate complaints concerning the actions of contractors managing prisons or police jails.\n\n- Telecommunications (Interception) (State Provisions) Act 1988 - enabled the Victoria Police Force to obtain warrants to intercept and record telephone conversations and empowered the Ombudsman to audit police records to ensure compliance with the Act.\n\n- Whistleblowers Protection Act 2001 - empowered the Ombudsman to investigate disclosures of improper conduct by public bodies and public officers, including members of Parliament and municipal councillors,\n\n- Transport (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act 2003 - empowered the Ombudsman to investigate complaints regarding the actions of officers employed by private transport companies in exercising statutory duties in the detection of offences.\n\nPolice Complaints\n\nUntil 1986 the Office of the Ombudsman also had responsibility for the review of the Victoria Police Internal Investigation Bureau files concerning complaints made against members of the Police Force.\n\nIn 1986, the Police Complaints Authority (VA 2834) was established under the provisions of the Police Regulations (Amendment) Act of 1985 which assumed this responsibility.\n\nIn May 1988, Ombudsman Victoria (VA 1037) was divided into two broad jurisdictions - the General Jurisdiction and the Police Jurisdiction.\n\nDeputy Ombudsman (Police Complaints) Act 1988 - created the position of Deputy Ombudsman (Police Complaints) and replaced the role of the Police Complaints Authority (May 1988).The Deputy Ombudsman (Police Complaints) was the same person who held the position of Ombudsman.\n\nThe Ombudsman Legislation (Police Ombudsman) Act 2004 abolished the position of Deputy Ombudsman (Police Complaints) and created the Office of Police Ombudsman (June 2004). This office was held by the person who was Ombudsman. The Act increased the Police Ombudsman's powers to investigate Victoria Police. The Office of Police Ombudsman as a separate agency is subject to further research.\n\nIn November 2004, the Major Crime Legislation (Office of Police Integrity) Act commenced. The Director, Office of Police Integrity (OPI) VA 4792 replaced the Police Ombudsman.\n\nThe functions of the former office of Police Ombudsman were incorporated into the charter of OPI with additional functions that dealt with the ethical and professional standards of Victoria Police and the investigation of police corruption and serious misconduct. The head of OPI was the same person who held the position of Ombudsman."

At the same time, the Victorian Government Architect transferred out of the Department to the new Department of Transport, Planning and Local Infrastructure (VA 5003). The changes were effected by order of the Governor-in-Council under section 10 (c) of the Public Administration Act 2004 (Victorian Government Gazette, S 124).\n\nFollowing the 29 November 2014 election DPC was enlarged.

This group also coordinated DPC's leadership on the policy priority of prevention of family violence, working closely with the separate secretariat for engagement with the Royal Commission into Family Violence.\n\nSeparately from these groups, two agencies were created, modelled on similar bodies a federal level and in NSW, to oversee a pipeline of infrastructure projects across electoral cycles and ensure the delivery of major projects:\n\n- Infrastructure Victoria\n- Projects Victoria\n\nUnder Administrative Arrangements Order (No. 219) 2104, with effect on 1 January 2015, DPC provided support to a number of administrative offices, statutory authorities and special bodies that had previously been supported by the Department of Justice:\n\n- Victorian Electoral Commission (VA 4196)\n- Victorian Electoral Boundaries Commission\n- The Office of the Freedom of Information Commissioner\n- Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission\n- Office of the Commissioner for Privacy and Data Protection\n- Public Interest Monitor\n- The Victorian Inspectorate\n\nOther supported agencies were:\n\n- Office of the Auditor-General (VA 1031)\n- Office of the Chief Parliamentary Counsel (VA 629)\n- Office of the Governor (VA 466)\n- Public Record Office Victoria (VA 683)\n- Victorian Multicultural Commission (VA 1029)\n- Victorian Ombudsman (1037)\n- Victorian Public Sector Commission (VA 5026)\n- Victorian Competition and Efficiency Commission\n- Local Government Investigations and Compliance Inspectorate (VA 5006)\n\nBy Order of the Governor in Council under section 11 of the Public Administration Act 2004, with effect on 1 January 2015, the Local Government Investigations and Compliance Inspectorate (the last-mentioned agency above) was disestablished in relation to the Department of Transport Planning and Local Infrastructure (VA 5003) and re-established in relation to DPC (Victoria Government Gazette No. S 432, 4 December 2014). By the same order, Arts Victoria (VA 4416) transitioned into Creative Victoria, and together with associated Arts agencies was removed from the support of DPC and transferred to the new Department of Economic Development, Jobs, Transport and Resources (VA 5034), with the sole exception of the Public Record Office Victoria (VA 683), which was retained by DPC as an agency reporting to the Special Minister of State and the Premier.\n\nOn 1 March 2016, the Department of Premier and Cabinet lost responsibility for the following Act, as per the Victorian Government Gazette, No. S 44, 8 March 2016:\n- Audit Act 1994 - Sections 8-10, 16A, 16B, 16D, 16E and 16G (responsibility was transferred to the Department of Treasury and Finance (VA 3745)).\n\nLocation of Records\n\nSee the inventory of series below.

    "description": "The Gas and Fuel Corporation was established by the Gas and Fuel Act 1950 (No.5507) which was proclaimed in 1951. The Act amalgamated the Metropolitan Gas Company and the Brighton Gas Company to form the Corporation. The Gas and Fuel Corporation was a public authority of the State owned jointly by the Government and share holders.\n\nFrom 1953 to 1974 the Corporation gradually purchased local municipal and company gas works including the Gas Supply Company's Victorian undertakings in 1970 and the Geelong Gas Company in 1971.\n\nIn 1991, the Government commissioned a study aimed at improving the performance of the Gas and Fuel Corporation. As a result of this study (Cresap, October 1991, Strategic and Organisational Review Final Report for the Gas and Fuel Corporation of Victoria) the Gas and Fuel Corporation was restructured into discrete business units such as corporate, transmission, distribution, retail and Heatane Gas.\n\nThe Gas Industry Act 1994 (Act No. 112/1994) was introduced to enable the complete corporatisation of the former Gas and Fuel Corporation. This legislation resulted in the further restructure of the Gas and Fuel Corporation into two parts. The Gas Transmission Corporation (GTC) - later renamed Transmission Pipelines Australia which was the manager of the main high-pressure gas pipelines and GASCOR, which operated the low pressure distribution assets, the gas retail function, consulting services and the Gasmart appliance retail business.\n\nGASCOR was established on 20 December 1994 and continued to trade as the Gas and Fuel. The former Gas and Fuel Corporation was formally wound up on 21 June 1995."

    "title": "State Bank of Victoria",
    "description": "Establishment and Background History\n\nThe State Bank of Victoria was established by 1912 when the Savings Banks Act (No.2365) provided for all Banks then operating under the Savings Banks Acts to be collectively named The State Savings Bank of Victoria.\n\nThe first Government controlled savings bank had been established on 1 January 1842 under New South Wales legislation. Known as the Savings Bank of Port Phillip it was administered by a Board of Trustees and a Vice-President. Branches of this Bank were subsequently established in other parts of the colony.\n\nIn 1853 a statutory body known as The Commissioners of Savings Banks in the Colony of Victoria was constituted under the Savings' Bank Act 1853 16 Vic., No.37. This body of Government appointed Commissioners was given responsibility for the direction of the Savings Bank of Port Phillip and its various branches. Each bank was thereafter to be a separate and independent institution with its own trustees and officers.\n\nThe Savings Banks Act 1890 Amendment Act 1896 (No.1481) introduced several major changes. The Commissioners of Savings Banks and the Post Office Savings Banks were amalgamated, thereafter to be administered as the Savings Bank Department. A separate Advances Department (commonly known as the Credit Foncier Department) which had been operating since 1893 was also formally established. These two departments operated as independent institutions despite both being the responsibility of the Commissioners.\n\nThe 1896 Act was originally intended to establish a unified State Bank, hence the use of the term \"Department\", however all references to this unification were removed from the Bill before it was passed. This dual division exists today for accounting purposes but does not reflect administrative structure.\n\nFurther changes resultant from the 1896 legislation included provision for the appointment of an Inspector-General (to become, in 1923, the position of General Manager) through whom the Commissioners would exercise their control, as well as the transfer of responsibility for Savings Banks legislation from the Chief Secretary to the Treasurer, where it currently remains.\n\nBetween 1896 and 1912 the independent Savings Banks of Victoria merged to become a single institution and this development was formalized by the 1912 legislation.\n\nServices\n\nServices offered by the Bank have included:\n\n savings bank facilities\n penny savings banks operating in State Schools (from 1912)\n safe deposit facilities (from 1913)\n special loans to discharged soldiers (from 1917)\n building homes for people of small means (from 1920s), including the Garden City estate at Fisherman's Bend\n Group Savings Club for workers in factories and offices (from 1927)\n bursary trusts for students (from 1938)\n accepting payment of electricity and gas accounts (from 1956)\n Christmas Club (from 1964)\n Credit Foncier facilities including mortgage loans and sale of debentures.\n\nIn addition, in 1989 the Bank purchased 49.9% of the Victorian Investment Corporation, previously a public unlisted company owned by the State Government (see VA 2986). This gave the Bank a role in investing capital in Victorian companies engaged in technological development.\n\nby 1980 the Bank comprised many separate departments providing a full range of savings, trading and merchant bank services through its many branches and agencies (including interstate and international facilities). From1980 the Bank was known as the State Bank of Victoria under the provisions of the State Bank Act 1980 (No.9458).\n\nThe State Bank of Victoria established its own Archives under the provisions of section 14 of the Public Records Act 1973.\n\nIn 1990 the Bank was sold to the Commonwealth Bank of Australia under the State Bank (succession of Commonwealth Bank) Act 1990. The Commonwealth Bank became the succesor in law to the State Bank. All property, rights, entitlements and liabilities of the State Bank were transferred to the Commonwealth Bank, and the State Bank was dissolved.\n\nAfter the sale, the Archives of the State Bank continued to operate until the Archives' holdings were transferred to PROV in 1995."

    "title": "Ministry of Ethnic Affairs (also known as Ministry of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs 1977 to 1983)",
    "description": "Formation of Ministry of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs\n\nThe Ministry of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs was established under the provisions of the Ministry of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs Act 1976 (No.8963) proclaimed in the Government Gazette on 9 February 1977. The Ministry assumed responsibility for the immigration function previously undertaken by the Immigration Division of the Department of State Development and Decentralization (VA 552) as well as responsibility for an embryonic ethnic affairs function from the Department of the Premier (VA 2717).\n\nImmigration (twentieth century)\n\nThis function included:\n administration of assisted immigration from the United Kingdom, including\n personal sponsorship (family reunions)\n employer sponsorship (industry and commerce)\n state sponsorship (government employees)\n administration of general (unassisted) immigration from the United\n Kingdom (prior to 1975 this was a Commonwealth responsibility)\n publicity of Victoria through the office of the Agent-General in London\n reception, transportation, accommodation and employment of State\n sponsored migrants.\n\nThe British immigration schemes were a joint Commonwealth-State responsibility.\nThe administration of non-British immigration, including reception and settlement services, was the responsibilty of the Commonwealth Government.\n\nImmigration Function passed to Commonwealth 1983\n\nThe Ministry's responsibility for immigration from the United Kingdom (assisted and unassisted) was transferred to the Commonwealth in 1983.\n\nFormation of Ethnic Affairs Commission and Change of Title of Ministry\n\nThe Ethnic Affairs Commission (VA 1029) was established on 9 November 1982 by the Ethnic Affairs Commission Act 1982 (No.9789). This Act repealed the Ministry of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs Act 1976 (No.8963) although the Ministry of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs effectively continued through to 16 February 1983 when the title of the Ministry was changed to Ministry of Ethnic Affairs. The Chairman of the Ethnic Affairs Commission became the Permanent Head of the Ministry on 15 March 1983.\n\nThe exact nature of the relationship between the Commission and the Ministry is subject to further research. The Commission comprised three full-time members (the Chairman and two deputies) and ten part-time members, none of whom could be subject to the Public Service Act 1974 (No.8656) in their capacity as Commission members. The Act, however, made provision for public servants to be appointed for \"the proper functioning of the Commission\". It is therefore evident that the Ministry of Ethnic Affairs carried out many of the functions of the Commission as determined by the 1982 Act. It is assumed that the Ministry maintained any records created by the Commission.\n\nEthnic Affairs\n\nThe function of ethnic affairs, as expressed in the 1976 Act, was:\n to promote settlement of migrants in the community\n to encourage ethnic groups to fully express their identity\n to develop community awareness of ethnic cultures\n to facilitate the building of a socially cohesive society\n to encourage migrants to fully participate in the community\n to prevent or remove racial discrimination\n to promote the welfare of migrants.\n\nActivities undertaken as part of this function included:\n provision of financial assistance for projects which furthered the concept of a cohesive but culturally diverse community (included funding of festivals, furnishing community centres, establishment of resource centres)\n seminars and talks relevant to ethnic communities\n community education programs to improve understanding and interaction among ethnic groups\n investigation of the needs of ethnic communities and research into ways to meet these needs on the best cost/benefit basis (this was the function of the Migrant Advisory Bureau which was transferred from the Department of the Premier), including:\n publication of the resource directory 'Migrants' Melbourne' in several languages\n provision of information to the public\n advice, investigation, conciliation and arbitration in certain migrant cases (including cases such as racial discrimination, legal problems, workers compensation, neighbourhood problems, housing, recognition of overseas qualifications etc.)\n community liaison between ethnic groups and government agencies\n improving communication and understanding between the police and ethnic groups\n responsibility for the Victoria Welcome Group\n translation services to Government departments and instrumentalities (from 1979)\n interpreting services for organisations and individuals (from c1982: the Interpreting Services Bureau had operated within the Department of the Premier from 1975)\n Cross Cultural Awareness Programs for persons working with migrant\n clients\n student exchange schemes\n monitoring government policies/reviews to identify discrimination against migrants\n relevant statistical research.\n\n\n\n\nAs part of the machinery of government changes announced by the Premier in January 1991 the \"policy development and administrative responsibilities\" of the Ethnic Affairs Commission were placed with the Office of Ethnic Affairs, established as an associated administrative unit of the Ministry of Ethnic, Municipal and Community Affairs (MEMCA) (VA 3015). As it is assumed that the Ministry of Ethnic Affairs had undertaken the \"policy development and administrative responsibilities\" of the Commission, the transfer of the function effectively occured from the Ministry to the Office of Ethnic Affairs within MEMCA.\n\nAdministrative Arrangements\n\nFrom 1977 to 1978 the Ministry was administratively located within the Department of State Development and Decentralization (VA 552) and from 1978 to 1981 in the Department of State Development, Decentralisation and Tourism (VA 2881), although it was responsible to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs throughout this time. From 1 July 1981 the Ministry had full departmental independence.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nSee List of Holdings 2nd edition 1985, sections 3.10.2 (immigration records of VA 1042 Ministry of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs) and 3.13.4 (VA 552 Department of State Development, Decentralisation and Tourism records).

    "description": "Establishment\n\nThe Metropolitan Transit Authority (M.T.A.) was set up under Section 15 of the Transport Act 1983 (No.9921) and commenced operation on 1 July 1983. It was a statutory body set up to co-ordinate and manage the operations of the former Melbourne Metropolitan Tramways Board (M.M.T.B.) (VA 2694), the metropolitan train operations (MET RAIL) and the operations of the former Melbourne Underground Rail Loop Authority (M.U.R.L.A.).\n\nAll the assets and liabilities of M.M.T.B. and M.U.R.L.A. were taken over by the M.T.A. on 1 July 1983.\n\nFunctions\n\nThe Act set out the functions of the M.T.A. as follows:\n\n to provide, manage and to operate transport services and facilities for passengers and freight in accordance with Government policy in metropolitan Melbourne.\n to arrange with the State Transport Authority (S.T.A.) or other transport operations to provide transport services.\n to co-ordinate transport services\n to develop integrated ticket systems\n to develop new modes of transport\n to investigate and to promote and undertake research into matters relating to the performance of its functions, powers and duties, and\n to provide, manage and operate tourist recreational facilities.\n\nRelationship to the Minister of Transport\n\nThe M.T.A. carried out these functions under the general direction and control of the Minister of Transport.\n\nUnder the provisions of Section 16 (1) of the Transport Act 1983, the M.T.A. could operate certain services outside the Melbourne Metropolitan area with the approval of the Minister.\n\nIn accordance with the powers vested in the Minister under Section 32 (1) of the Act, Ministerial approval was required for the letting of contracts, appointment of consultants and staff, granting of research grants, the release staff to take up appointments following transfer or promotions between the Authorities (M.T.A. and S.T.A.) and the replacement of personnel retiring under the Early Retirement Plan.\n\nStructure of the Authority\n\nThe MET employed more than 12,000 people across five divisions in 1984-85.\n\nMet Rail Division\n\nUntil 30 June 1983, the metropolitan rail services were operated as an integral part of Vic Rail. After that date a separate Met Rail Division was established as part of M.T.A. to perform this function. The Chief General Manager of the Division reported on matters of safety to the S.T.A. Board and operationally to the Managing Director of M.T.A. to ensure that the Met Rail services and standards of service were those required by M.T.A.\n\nThe M.T.A. worked closely with the State Transport Authority (VA 1038) and had arrangements with the S.T.A. to provide Met Rail services and facilities for an agreed fee. The M.T.A. provided funds to the S.T.A. to operate trains on its behalf and for capital projects relating to Met Rail.\n\nDocuments used by Met Rail consisted of records of the Victorian Railway Board relating to metropolitan rail operations and records relating to its own role as part of the M.T.A. A separate Met Rail correspondence registry was maintained.\n\nPersonnel records relating to Met Rail matters were held separately, the Met Rail organisation having an integral personnel organisation. The finance and corporate services records relating to Met Rail matters were also held separately.\n\nTram and Bus Division\n\nThis Division's responsibility was to maintain the services of all trams, government buses and route operations of the bus network.\n\nDocuments relating to this Division include those of the former M.M.T.B. (VA 2694) and the Division's own operations comprising existing tram and bus services.\n\nMarketing and Planning Division\n\nThis Division was responsible for identifying consumer needs and preferences, coordinating the total service and providing and developing strategies in operations and investment to meet the community's transport requirements. A Customer Services Department was established under this Division to deal with public transport enquiries.\n\nFinance and Corporate Services\n\nThis Division provided financial, accounting, administrative and legal services.\n\nPersonnel and Employee Relations Division\n\nThis Division attended to the occupational requirements of all employees. It also controlled the combined M.T.A. and ministerial library.\n\nRestructuring 1986 - 1988\n\nDuring the year 1986-87, the Boards of the S.T.A. and the M.T.A. entered into a contractual agreement, concerning powers in the personnel management field, with respect to staff employed in Met Rail Division. The M.T.A. assumed full responsibility for personnel issues affecting the Met Rail staff. However, the S.T.A. continued to provide services to Met Rail, on behalf of the M.T.A. in the occupational medicine and occupational health, welfare and safety fields.\n\nIn 1986-87, the process of integration of the staff from the Met Rail with the staff of the Tram and Bus Division began. The first step in this direction was the consolidation of the personnel function through integration of the former Met Rail Personnel Group activities with the former corporate Bus and Tram Division. A Human Resources Division was established as a single integrated personnel section, comprising a composite staff from both tramways and railway background to support the total operations of the MET. The Director, Human Resources, reported to the Managing Director. Responsibility for industrial relations was transferred from the Human Resources Division and centralised under the control of the General Manager, Industrial Relations, who had responsibility for both V Line and the MET.\n\nEstablishment of an Integrated Tram, Train and Bus Service\n\nBy 11 April 1988 the total integration of the transport systems had been achieved and the departments responsible for the operation, maintenance and administration of trams, trains and buses had been brought together. The management of the Authority was restructured to provide an efficient integrated service to the public.\n\nThree Directorates were established:\n\n Operations\n Engineering and Project Development and\n Resources.\n\nThe Operations Directorate was responsible for operating the three modes of transport: trains, trams and buses.\n\nThe Engineering and Project Development Directorate was responsible for the management of engineering projects related to the maintenance and construction of tracks, signals, buildings, bridges etc.\n\nThe Resources Directorate was responsible for planning, finance and administration, marketing and information systems.\n\nMET Plan\n\nThe future direction for urban transport in Melbourne has been established in the Authority's document, MET Plan - Melbourne's transport blueprint for the future. It discusses options for the extension of the train network and the creation of a new light rail and bus network to meet the demands of the outer suburbs. The first light rail line in Australia came into operation on 20 November 1987 with the opening of the North-South Rail route running from East Brunswick to St. Kilda Beach. The opening of the Port Melbourne light rail line followed in December 1987.\n\nThe MET Plan also proposes a new network of cross-town bus routes (MET Link) to cater for local needs.\n\nMerger with the State Transport Authority, 1989\n\nOn 1 July 1989, the Metropolitan Transit Authority and the State Transport Authority (VA 1038) combined to form the Public Transport Corporation (VA 2984).\n\nLocation of Records\n\nSee record series listed below."

    "description": "Establishment as the Working Men's College\n\nThe Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology was established in 1887 as the Working Men's College. The first Council, consisting of representatives of the Government, Trades Hall, the University of Melbourne, the Public Library, subscribers and the founder, the Hon. Francis Ormond, had been established in 1882.\n\nInitially the Working Men's College was autonomous and the College Council was responsible for its administration. Revenue was derived from government subsidy, student fees and subscriptions. The College provided technical and general courses for men and women.\n\nDevelopment of a Junior Technical School\n\nDuring the 1890's a programme of preparatory classes for younger students was developed. By 1902 the first junior technical school had been established in the College. In 1912 this section of the College became the nucleus of the first Education Department Technical School at West Melbourne. This development was probably a consequence of the passing of the Education Act 1910 and the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Technical Education (1899-1901). In 1919 the College re-established a junior school and in 1933 it was combined with the West Melbourne Junior Technical School under the control of the College. In 1938 the school was closed to permit the erection of the Foods Trade School.\n\nLiaison with the Education Department (VA 714)\n\nDuring the 1890's depression, Government funding for Council controlled Schools of Mines, Art and Design and Technical Colleges such as the Working Men's College was severely restricted. In 1892 the Government introduced new funding arrangements which effectively undermined the autonomy of the colleges. Payments to colleges were to be based on attendances and examination results and only approved courses were to be funded. The colleges were opposed to the new arrangements and the Working Men's College remained closed for the first quarter of 1893. In 1896 the system of fixed annual grants was restored.\n\nIn 1904 the College was incorporated under the Companies Act as a limited liability company.\n\nFollowing proclamation of the Education Act 1910, particularly Part 3, Division 3, sections 37, 38 and 39, the Education Department (VA 714) sought to establish direct control over the College. The College Council remained autonomous but agreed to abide by departmental regulations. By 1905, the regulations dealt with conditions under which government grants for maintenance, buildings or apparatus, might be claimed; the subjects of instruction prescribed and the methods of holding examinations; diplomas and certificates awarded and the mode of keeping rolls and the presentation of balance sheets. Instructors were appointed by the Council but the Education Department reserved a right of veto.\n\nCourses\n\nThe College began as an evening institute offering classes in technical and general subjects leading to the award of several different levels of certificate. By 1899 the College offered full time day courses in engineering and applied science leading to the award of \"Associate\" Diplomas. Various teaching departments were established in engineering, chemistry, metallurgy and mining, fitting and turning etc. The College continued to offer instruction in a wide range of trades. In 1919 the College became a centre for the vocational training of returned soldiers.\n\nEstablishment of Melbourne Technical College\n\nIn 1934, the Working Men's College became the Melbourne Technical College. The College continued to derive its revenue from students' fees supplemented by government grants. It remained under the management of its own Council but many of its courses and examinations were governed by Education Department regulations.\n\nCourses and other functions 1935 to 1955\n\nThe College provided full time day and evening professional courses in the various branches of engineering, mining, metallurgy, architecture, applied chemistry, applied physics, agriculture, art and applied art and commercial work. Full time and part time day and evening trade courses were also provided in trades connected with the electrical and mechanical engineering, motor, building, furniture, printing, bootmaking, clothing and food industries.\n\nDuring the 1939-1945 war, Melbourne Technical College played a major role in the training of the defence forces. Classes were established for the training of R.A.A.F. technical units, Army Signal Corps trainees and trainee fitters and turners and tool makers. An aeronautical school was added to the College. During this period some 20,000 servicemen were enrolled and some 2,000 trainees were prepared for munitions production.\n\nIn the post-war period the College took in many thousands of ex-service personnel for training under the Commonwealth Reconstruction Scheme. This led to an expansion of the full time and part time Diploma courses available. These were usually one year longer than the standard associateship Diploma.\n\nDuring the 1950's the College developed new courses in areas such as communications technology, particularly television and was one of the first colleges to train television engineers, technicians and mechanics. Other new areas developed included food technology, transport studies, accountancy, real estate and advertising.\n\nThe College offered Professional Diploma Courses. Tuition for Diploma Courses was aimed at students achieving at least the minimum standard required for entry to professional institutions such as the Australian Society of Accountants, the Royal Australian Institute of Architects and the Institution of Engineers. Students who completed an additional year of study were granted the Fellowship Diploma which was regarded as being three years post matriculation. The College also offered Technician Courses which were regarded as being intermediate between the professional and trade courses. The Apprenticeship Commission prescribed the details of the courses offered in various trades. These were of four to five years duration and accompanied by a period of practical apprenticeship. Post apprenticeship courses were also available.\n\nCorrespondence Courses which had developed rapidly during the 1939-45 war continued. The Correspondence School provided professional, technician and trade courses for people unable to attend the College. Courses were also available to defence personnel posted abroad and to students in South East Asia who could undertake the first year through the Division of External Studies. This enabled the Government to assess their capabilities before granting them assistance.\n\nBy this time the College was also providing a variety of services to industry and the government departments and authorities. These included teaching, professional advice and technological testing and research of products, equipment and systems.\n\nEstablishment of the Royal Melbourne Technical College\n\nIn 1954 by order of the Executive Council and pursuant to the provisions of the Companies Act, the Melbourne Technical College became the Royal Melbourne Technical College and was authorised to include the royal cypher on College Diplomas. It continued to be controlled by its own Council which included representatives of government, commerce, industry, unions and the University of Melbourne.\n\nThe College continued to offer a wide range of diploma, technician and trade courses and began to develop many specialist short courses in subjects such as plastics technology and shop inspection. Many subjects in the formal courses continued to be examined externally by the Education Department but as the College expanded its programmes and introduced courses in new fields of technology, the proportion of internally assessed courses increased significantly.\n\nEstablishment of Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology\n\nOn 26 December 1960, the Registrar of Companies issued a Certificate of Incorporation and change of name to the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (R.M.I.T.). The change of name was in accord with the plans of the Council to elevate the status of the College to that of a College or University of Advanced Technology.\n\nFrom this time there was a rapid expansion in the courses offered at diploma, certificate and apprenticeship level and in the services provided by the Institute. The Institute also began to offer courses in areas which had previously been the province of Universities and other tertiary institutions. For example in 1962, the University of Melbourne imposed a quota on the number of first year law students. The Council of Legal Education (C.L.E.) which was responsible for all academic and practical legal training initiated a course for articled clerks to be administered by R.M.I.T., although the lecturers, tutors and examiners were appointed by the C.L.E..\n\nAdministrative Change following Implementation of Commonwealth Funding\n\nArising from the Ramsay Report 1963 and the Martin Report 1965, the Commonwealth Government introduced matching financial grants to Colleges of Advanced Education.\n\nThe Victoria Institute of Colleges (V.I.C.) was established in June 1965 to co-ordinate tertiary education. R.M.I.T. became an affiliated college under the V.I.C. in 1965. In December 1967, this Institute became responsible for controlling college staff establishments, recommending staff salary scales, the approval of major financial and building programmes and for improving the academic standards in colleges. R.M.I.T. continued to award diplomas but students who completed approved courses could be awarded degrees under the V.I.C..\n\nSince the Commonwealth was initially only prepared to fund tertiary level study, it became necessary for R.M.I.T. to distinguish between its tertiary and non-tertiary courses. By 1969 the Institute effectively had two separate branches: the Professional Courses Branch and the Industrial Courses Branch. In time these came to be referred to as the Advanced College and the Technical College.\n\nThe Education Department had relinquished its direct control over the Advanced College's courses and examinations when the V.I.C. was established, but it maintained its influence, together with that of the Apprenticeship Commission, on many of the courses at the Technical College.\n\nAlthough it had been intended that two administratively separate institutions would be established, in 1977 R.M.I.T. Council determined that both sections would remain under one Principal and Council. While they are academically separate and their sources of funding are largely separate, the two Colleges share a central management and support services.\n\nEstablishment of Victorian Post Secondary Education Commission\n\nUnder the provisions of the Post Secondary Education Act 1978, the Victorian Government established the Victorian Post Secondary Education Commission (V.P.S.E.C.) to advise the Government on all aspects of the development, operation, co-ordination and funding of post secondary education. V.P.S.E.C. was initially responsible for the approval and accreditation of courses and for establishing conditions for the award of Diplomas and Degrees.\n\nIn May 1981, R.M.I.T. awarded its own degrees for the first time and in 1983 it achieved 'declared status' which means that once V.P.S.E.C. has approved the establishment of a course in principle, R.M.I.T. is responsible for the development and accreditation of the course.\n\nTechnical and Further Education (T.A.F.E.)\n\nIn July 1980... truncated"

    "description": "Until 1841 provision of medical and hospital services within the Port Phillip District was limited to a Government hospital catering for convicts, prisoners, military and public servants, although non-Government patients without means for medical services could apply to the superintendent for admittance to this hospital. The provision of public hospital services in the District did not however commence until the opening of the Melbourne Hospital on 15 March 1848, although the committee which managed the Hospital dates from 5 March 1841. On that date a public meeting was held in the Police Office, chaired by Superintendent La Trobe, which moved a resolution to establish a public hospital in Melbourne. After the resolution was passed a committee of citizens was appointed to organize a building fund and to approach the Government for financial assistance.\n\nIn the meantime a second meeting, held in January 1842, decided to establish a temporary hospital for urgent cases. For most of its existence this temporary hospital was situated in a two-storied house in Bourke Street West owned by John Pascoe Fawkner.\n\nIn 1845 the New South Wales Government finally agreed to a grant of land as well as a building grant of one thousand pounds, providing that a similar amount could be raised locally.\n\nIn January 1846 tenders were called and the foundation stone was laid on 20 March. With the opening of the permanent hospital on 15 March 1848 the temporary hospital closed its doors.\n\nTo establish the legal status of various hospitals in the Colony of New South Wales a New Wouth Wales \"Act to enable certain Public Hospitals to sue and be sued in the name of their Treasurer, and to provide for the taking and holding of Real Property belonging to such Hospitals\" (11 Vict., No. 59) was assented to on 17 June 1847.\n\nUntil 1935 the hospital was known as the Melbourne Hospital. The corporate name chanded to Royal Melbourne Hospital after the committee was informed that His Majesty the King had been pleased to grant the prefix 'Royal' to the title. This was formalized by notice in the Government Gazette on 27 March 1935.\n\nThe current mission statement of the Hospital states that the hospital is \"to provide patient services and to undertake teaching and research activities as effectively and efficiently as possible\".\n\nWith respect to teaching, the hospital has had a close association wtih the University of Melbourne, the first students of the Medical School having undertaken clinical training at the hospital in 1864. Several Professorial Chairs of the University of Melbourne are currently located at the hospital. The Royal Melbourne Hospital has also provided extensive nursing training since 1889, as well as providing facilities for training in other disciplines associated with the treatment and care of patients.\n\nThe Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, founded in 1916 and located on the same site, is controlled by representatives of the Royal Melbourne Hospital, the University of Melbourne and the Walter and Eliza Hall Trust. Also located on site is the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research.\n\nOn 18 March 1986 the Royal Melbourne Hospital and the Essendon and District Memorial Hospital (VA 1427) were formally amalgamated by the Governor-in-Council. Although both the hospitals were to retain their identity, under the amalgamation the new corporate name became 'The Amalgamated Melbourne and Essendon Hospitals' and the separate Boards of Management were replaced by a single Board.\n\nThe Essendon and District Memorial Hospital had opened in 1964 as a maternity hospital and since amalgamation has expanded to include specialist orthopaedic and rehabilitation services.\n\nIn 1990 the Royal Melbourne Hospital is once again using its former name with the former Essendon and District Memorial Hospital being referred to as the Essendon Campus.\n\nSources\n\nRussell, X.F.

Working through Committees of Management the provision of advice and financial assistance for control of erosion on coastal foreshores.\n\nBackground\n\nSoil erosion was noticed in Victoria as early as the 1850s and sand drift in the Mallee district was mentioned at a Royal Commission in the 1870s. For many years however, little interest was shown in the matter, since damage to lands in the settled districts was not widespread. As settlement developed and the cumulative effects of land exploitation began to be felt, soil erosion in various forms increased rapidly. In 1887, a committee of inquiry was formed to examine problems of river siltation arising from mining operations. This resulted in the formation of a Sludge Abatement Board in 1905. Severe floods in the 1890s started erosion on the banks of several Victorian rivers. In 1917, the more obvious forms of gully and stream erosion were investigated, and the Minister for Public Works called for the setting up of an Erosion Enquiry Committee which resulted in the formation of a River Erosion and Flood Protection Branch of the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission. Subsequently in the 1920s erosion in water catchments and the siltation of reservoirs were of considerable concern. Wind erosion and drifting sand were made more evident by new settlement in the Mallee district and by a succession of dry years, and in 1930 a Sand Drift Central Committee was formed which presented a report on erosion in 1933.\n\nThe Victorian Department of Agriculture conducted experiments on the control of wind erosion and sand drift at the Mallee research station at Walpeup and the Public Works Department undertook the control of coastal erosion. In 1937 the Government appointed a committee to inquire into the incidence and gravity of soil erosion in the State; its report was presented in 1938 and drew attention to widespread damage, not only in the hill catchments and in the Mallee, but also in many other farming areas. In 1940 the Soil Conservation Act was passed and the Soil Conservation Board (later Authority) was formed; subsequently regional advisory committees were appointed and a number of demonstration and experimental areas were established.\n\nIn 1945, a Bogong High Plains Committee was established and in 1946 a Royal Commission was held into the grazing of forests. This led to the passing of the Soil Conservation and Land Utilisation Act 1947 and the formation of the Land Conservation Authority, which in 1950 became the Soil Conservation Authority. The major difference bwtween the Authority and the old Board lay in the Authority's power to direct land owners to remedy erosion, to impose conditions on the use of land to prevent erosion and to regulate the use of land in catchments.\nThe Land Utilisation Advisory Council, which was also established in 1950 under this legislation, had responsibility for defining catchment areas and advising the Minister and the Soil Conservation Authority on land use in any catchment area.\n\nAdministrative Arrangements\n\nBetween 1949 and 1973 the Soil Conservation Authority was functionally responsible to the Minister for Conservation but administratively responsible to the Premier within whose department it was located.\n\nFollowing its transfer to the newly established Ministry for Conservation in 1973, the Authority reported only to Minister to Conservation. In 1984 the Minister to Conservation, Forests and Lands assumed responsibility for the Authority.\n\nFrom 1984 the policy, planning and operational responsibilities of the Soil Conservation Authority were carried out by the Department of Conservation, Forests and Lands. In 1987 the Soil Conservation Authority was abolished and responsibility for the statutory provisions of the Soil Conservation and Land Utilisation Act 1958 (No.6372) were transferred to the Secretary of the Department and the Minister.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nSee List of Holdings 1985, section 3.6.22."

    "description": "Establishment\n\nIn 1933 an expert committee comprising the Director of Agriculture, the General Superintendent of Transportation and the Chief Engineer for Railway Construction was established to study and propose State action to provide for the economical and efficient bulk receival, storage and transportation of grains in Victoria. The recommendations of the committee resulted in the Grain Elevators Act 1934 (No.4269) establishing the Grain Elevators Board of Victoria.\n\nFunctions\n\nUnder the legislation the Board was charged with responsibility for the acquisition and construction of country grain elevators and terminal elevators and the control and regulation of all grain handling. The Board was responsible for all activities connected with the storage of grain, including weighing, issuing of warrants or receipts for grain delivered, supply management, quality control, pest control, and data collection. The Grain Elevators Act 1958 (No.6266), which redefined the powers and authority of the Board, provided for the construction, maintenance and control of elevators by the Board within the State of New South Wales along the Yarrawonga-Oaklands, Echuca-Deniliquin and Barnes-Balranald railway lines. In 1977, the Board became the sole grain handling authority in Victoria under the Act to amend the Grain Elevators Act 1958 (No.9010).\n\nThe Board was appointed by and responsible to the Minister of Agriculture. It was originally composed of a chairman with business experience, a representative of the Victorian Railway Commissioners or the Railway Construction Branch of the Board of Land and Works, and a representative of the grain growers. The Board structure was later changed to provide for three grower members, one member of the Victorian Railways, one member of the Department of Agriculture, and an independent business person.\n\nIn order to fulfil its mandate, the Board appointed a General Manager and developed a corporate structure with divisions responsible for administration and the management of grain supply, elevator and facilities operations, and the construction and maintenance of elevators. Apart from the Head Office functions in Melbourne, staff were distributed throughout the state at five regional offices and the two export terminals at Geelong and Portland, reporting to Head Office through the Operations Division. In addition to its operation of elevators and grain management activities, the Board also became active in the provision of international consulting services in association with the Australian Wheat Board.\n\nThe Grain Elevators Board was dissolved under the Grain Handling and Storage Act 1995 (No.45, 1995) and wound up operations on December 31, 1995. Its assets were sold to a operator, VicGrain Limited, which continued the key operating functions of the Board."

    "description": "Establishment\n\nThe Environment Protection Authority was constituted under the Environment Protection Act 1970 and came into being on 1 July 1971 although the bulk of the Act, enabling it to carry out its functions, was not proclaimed until 1 March 1973. The Authority was established to act as the central pollution control agency in Victoria. Pollution control had previously been the responsibility of a number of state and local government agencies which had led to major problems of co-ordination.\n\nFunctions\n\nSection 13 of the Act set out seventeen powers, duties and functions. The first two established the Authority's broad objectives;\n\n to administer the Act and to be responsible for and co-ordinate all activities relating to the discharge of wastes, the prevention and control of pollution and the protection and improvement of the environment. The Authority stated its aim as \"to protect and improve the air, land and water environments for the people of Victoria through management of wastes, control of noise and prevention of pollution\".\n\nThis encompasses:\n\n atmospheric emissions\n litter\n noise\n pollution\n threats to air quality\n threats to water quality\n waste\n\nThe remaining fifteen functions in Section 13 set out specific activities. These are:\n\n the issuing of licenses to control the volume, type, constituents and effects of waste, emissions, deposits and other pollutants.\n\n the specification of standards and criteria for the protection and maintenance of the quality of the environment including the taking of samples and regular testing and monitoring;\n\n the conduct and co-ordination of research into pollution and its prevention;\n\n investigation to ensure compliance of the Act including the enforcement of conditions of licensed discharges, the detection of unlicensed discharges and the investigation of reports and complaints concerning pollution;\n\n the handling of submission of plans relating to any form of waste disposal system;\n\n the submission of Environmental Protection Policies to the Governor in Council. These policies aim to identify an area and segment of the environment which has been subjected to despoliation (eg the waters of Port Phillip Bay), to set out the beneficial uses of that segment and to establish criteria and standards which must be achieved in order to ensure the continuation of those beneficial uses;\n\n publication of reports and information, education of the public and the formation of expert panels; liaison with other states and the Commonwealth Governments;\n\n the co-ordination and enforcement of long range planning in environmental and waste management and pollution control and to report to and advise the Minister on the environment and possible amendments to legislation.\n\nDelegation of certain licensing functions to 1985/86\n\nTo help the Authority meet its licensing function, Section 68 of the Act gave it the ability to delegate licensing and enforcement powers to other government agencies who had to exercise such powers under E.P.A. guidelines. Five agencies were eventually given various levels of responsibility:\n\n the Latrobe Valley Water and Sewerage Board for licenses to discharge waste to water, air and land in the Latrobe Valley and East Gippsland areas,\n\n the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works and the Dandenong Valley Authority for licenses to discharge waste to waters within their areas,\n\n the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission for licenses to discharge waste to inland waters and waters in areas not covered by the above agencies, and\n\n (until 1981/82 when the Authority retrieved its responsibility) the Commission of Public Health for licenses to discharge waste to land throughout the whole state except for the area covered by the Latrobe Valley Water and Sewerage Board.\n\nThe Authority itself always handled all air licenses except for the area covered by the Latrobe Valley Water and Sewerage Board, water licenses for all coastal waters including Port Phillip and Westernport Bays, all noise control licenses and licenses involving the delegated agencies themselves. However during the 1985/86 financial year it appears as though all those delegations were revoked with powers transferred back to the Authority.\n\nThe Authority itself is composed of three members appointed by the Governor in Council, two of whom must have expertise in environmental control.\n\nThe Act also established the Environment Protection Council, a seventeen member body appointed by the Governor in Council. It assumed an advisory role in relation to matters relating to the Authority's, powers, duties and functions as well as to any matter referred to it by the Authority.\n\nThe Act also established the Environment Protection Appeals Board to hear appeals against licensing decisions of the Authority and its delegated agencies. As it was an autonomous body it did not come under the Authority's control. In 1987 responsibility for this function was transferred to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (VA 2659).\n\nStructure\n\nTo meet all of its responsibilities, the Authority was originally structured into 10 branches. The control and prevention of pollution was mainly the responsibility of 4 branches; the Air Quality, Land Waste Management, Noise Control and Water Quality Branches. Each of these branches performed more or less the same activity in the licensing of discharges (exclusive of those administered by the delegated agencies) and the liaison with relevant committees and agencies. Each of these branches also conducted analytical research and monitoring. The direction and co-ordination of this research work was the responsibility of the Laboratory Services Branch. It was also responsible for ensuring the standardization of analytical methods used.\n\nCompliance of the provisions of the Act was the responsibility of the Investigations Branch. It had three main functions; the enforcement of conditions of licensed discharges, the detection of unlicensed discharges and the investigation of reports and complaints concerning pollution.\n\nThe Planning and Research Branch was responsible mainly for submitting proposals on behalf of the Authority on the environmental aspects of land subdivisions, planning schemes and statements of planning policy. As such it eventually worked in close liaison with planning agencies, notably the Town and Country Planning Board, Regional Planning Authorities and the Planning Section of the MMBW.\n\nThe three remaining branches dealt with administration, information services and legal services. This last branch was responsible for the provision of legal advice, the initiation of litigation under the Act and to represent the Authority before the Environment Protection Appeals Board.\n\nThis basic structure remained in place until the end of at least the 1977/78 year. By 1980/81 restructuring had taken place with the emergence of three divisions. The Administration Branch became the Administrative Services Division. Investigations, Laboratory Services and Planning and Research all became branches of the Division of Special Services. The final division, named Waste and Noise Management oversaw the work of the Air Quality, Land Waste Management, Noise Control and Water Quality Branches. The Legal and Information Services Branches still existed but did not come under the direct control of any one division.\n\nA more significant restructure occurred during 1983/84 concurrent with the abolition of the Ministry for Conservation (VA 551), to which the Authority had been responsible since 1973 and the creation of the Ministry for Planning and Environment (VA 1024) in 1983.\n\nThis restructure was also concurrent with an overhaul of the Act which was significant for abolishing the Environment Protection Council and its replacement with the Environment Council. This new body reports directly to the Minister on EPA proposals, recommends changes to the Act and comments of the way in which the Authority administers the Act.\n\nOnce again three divisions were created with only Administrative Services remaining untouched from the old structure. The first new division was titled Water, Wastes and Chemicals. It included the Water Quality and Land Waste Management Branches as well as a new Core Group Laboratory. This laboratory has since been replaced by a Recycling Unit. The other new division is the Division of Air and Noise. This includes the Air Quality and Noise Control Branches as well as a unit devoted to the Melbourne Airshed Study. This unit relates to the study of air pollution in the metropolitan area and was funded prior to 1985 by the SEC.\n\nOnce again a number of branches within this structure did not come under the control of any one division. The Investigations, Information Services, Legal Services and Planning and Research Branches instead all reported directly to the Chairman of the Authority. Since then, the Information Services Branch has been renamed Public Relations, and it and Legal Services have become branches of the Division of Administrative Services. The Investigations and Planning and Research Branches appear to have been disbanded and staff placed in other divisions.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nFor records of this agency see List of Holdings 1985, section 3.15.2\n\nLEGISLATION\nClean Air Act 1958\nEnvironment Protection 1970\n - (Amendments) 1972,1974,1978,1983,1984\n - (Noise Control) 1975,1978\n - (Clean Air) 1981\n - (License Fees) 1981\n - (Air Pollution Control) 1982\n - (Lead in Petrol) 1982\n - (Penalties) 1982\n - (Review) 1984\n - (Industrial Waste) 1985\n\nSOURCES\n1.

    "description": "Establishment\n\nThe Office of Corrections was created to provide an integrated system of community based and custodial correctional services for convicted and unconvicted adult offenders. The establishment of the agency was a response to reports commissioned shortly after the election of the Cain Government from Mr J.D. Henderson, a U.S. prison consultant and Commander P.H. Bennett of the Victoria Police. These reports concluded that Victoria's prison system was long overdue for re-development.\n\nThe Office of Corrections and the position of the Director General of Corrections were established initially by an Order-in-Council gazetted on 17 August 1983. Establishment of the agency and the responsibilities of the Director General were legislatively confirmed and defined when the Community Welfare Services (Director General of Corrections) Act 1983 (No.9966) came into operation on 22 November 1983 and full operational responsibility was achieved on 1 February 1984 when the agency assumed responsibility for the delivery of all community based correctional programs. The Director General of Corrections initially reported to the Minister of Community Welfare Services.\n\nThe new agency consolidated two functions previously exercised by the Department of Community Welfare Services. The first function, the administration of the State's prisons and attendance centres, including the provision of prisoner support/welfare services, had been the responsibility of the Correctional Services Division, Department of Community Welfare Services. Control of the second function, the provision of a community based corrections program covering probation, parole and community service orders, had been vested in a Correctional Field Services Unit, within the Regional Services Division. All responsibility for the provision of services for juvenile offenders remained with the Department and now reside with the Department of Community Services.\n\nFunctional Divisions\n\nTo meet its responsibilities, the Office of Corrections was structured into four divisions.\n\nThe Prisons Division\n\nThis division is responsible for the management of Victoria's prisons, prisoner classification and delivery of prison programs including prisoner support services. Responsibility for all prison manufacturing and farming industries is vested in the Victorian Prison Industries Commission which was established in 1984. The Prisons Division essentially continued the work of the previous Correctional Services Division, although responsibility for the state's attendance centres was transferred to the new Community Based Corrections Division.\n\nThe Community Based Corrections Division\n\nThis division is responsible for the operation of all non-custodial programs, that is the administration of all punishments which do not involve prison detention (for example probation attendance centres and community service orders) and the rehabilitation of persons released from prison detention through parole or pre-release orders. The work of this division is largely carried out in Attendance/Correction Centres scattered throughout the State which also serve as the agency's regional offices. The administration of parole and pre-release orders is undertaken in close co-operation with the Adult Parole Board which operates as an independent agency.\n\nThe remaining two Divisions supported the work of these Divisions. The Strategic Services Division consisted of specialist units responsible for planning and review, building development, information systems, policy and program development, research, legislative development and public relations. The Management Services Division provides the agency with the necessary administrative, training, financial, management and other support services. The Strategic Services Division was incorporated into this Division during 1986.\n\nMinisterial Responsibility\n\nIn 1985 responsibility for this agency was transferred to the Attorney-General's portfolio (VRG 19), and since 1987 has been the responsibility of the Minister responsible for Corrections (VRG 93).\n\nLegislation\n\nThe Office of Corrections is currently responsible for the administration of the following Acts:\n\nPenalties and Sentences Act 1985\nCommunity Welfare Services (Director General of Corrections) Act 1983\nCommunity Welfare Services (Pre-Release Program) Act 1983\nParole Orders (Transfer) Act 1983\nPrisoners (Interstate Transfer) Act 1983\nCorrections Act 1986.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nA few records of this agency are in the custody of the P.R.O., see list below. Some records relating to correctional services are listed in the List of Holdings second edition 1985, section 3.4.7."

Its function was to possess and control the Exhibition building in Carlton Gardens and specified surrounding areas for the purposes of public exhibitions and public instruction and recreation (s14 Victorian Exhibitions Act) except for when Exhibition Commissioners were in existence (s10 Victorian Exhibitions Act). Exhibition Commissioners could be appointed for up to three years to \"carry out and superintend any public exhibition of works of industry and art authorized to be held in accordance with the provisions of 'The Exhibitors Protection Act' 1872 (s2 Victorian Exhibitions Act, and similarly in s4 Exhibitions Act 1890). Commissioners were appointed for the Melbourne International Exhibition 1880 and the Melbourne International Centennial Exhibition 1888.\n\nThe Exhibition Trustees' commencement date is subject to research. It took possession and control of the Exhibition Building and surrounding areas on 1 October 1881. The building and surrounding areas had been controlled by Commissioners for the Melbourne International Exhibition 1880 until 30 September 1881 (s5 Victorian Exhibitions Act 1878). The Exhibition Trustees then managed the Exhibition Building (known from 1 October 1980 as the Royal Exhibition Building) (s2 Exhibition (Amendment) Act 1981)) and surrounding areas from October 1881 except for a short period in 1888 and 1889 during the Melbourne International Centennial Exhibition (file 1/EXORG folio 73; Trustees Annual Report 1993 page 5).\n\nWhether The Exhibition Trustees continued to exist for the duration of the Commissioners for the 1888 Exhibition is subject to research.\n\nThe agency was reconstituted in 1958 by s3 of the Exhibition Act 1957 (No. 6120), with the new Trust being successor in law to the old Trustees (s12 Exhibition Act 1957).\n\nTrustees were appointed and removed by the Governor in Council. Up to seven Trustees could hold appointment at a time. Until 1958 the Trustees had to include the Mayor and another Councillor of the City of Melbourne (s7 Victorian Exhibitions Act and s8 Exhibitions Act 1890).\n\nFrom 1958 to 1979 the Trustees had to include an officer of the Chief Secretary's Department and two Melbourne City Councillors (s4 Exhibition Act 1957).

    "description": "The Timber Promotion Council (previously known as Timber Promotion Committee from 1969 to 1975) was established in 1969 by Regulation under powers conferred by Section 99 of the Forests Act 1958. The Timber Promotion Committee (as it was known circa 1969) was made up of nine members three of whom were appointed by the Minister, three nominated by the Commissioner and another nominated by the Sawmillers Association.\n\nThe Timber Promotion Council (TPC) was established by the Forests (Timber Promotion) Regulations 1975 made pursuant to the Forests Act 1958. The Council undertook product research and development, marketing and market research and training in relation to the efficient use of (primarily Victorian) timber. It offered a timber advisory service to specifiers and the public.\n\nThe Forests Act 1958, No. 6254 section 99 referred to leases and licences, regulation of grazing and cutting trees down. Lighting of fires was prohibited. Legislation to train and educate people to work in forests was encouraged. The thrust of the legislation was to manage and preserve the forests to maximise production of timber for itself and for various uses.\n\nThe TPC Annual Report 2003-2004 lists the Council as being primarily responsible, on behalf of its stakeholders, for:\n- the development of new and existing domestic and timber market opportunities,\n- the promotion of new and existing markets,\n- the protection of existing markets from competitors,\n- addressing market impediment issues, and\n- assisting Australwood and other co-operatives in export market resource development.\n\nTPC is also responsible for representing the Victorian Timber Industry stakeholders on state, national and international matters relating to:\n\n- Standards and codes,\n- R&D (research and development),\n- Education and training,\n- Regulatory impediment issues, and\n- Other technical matters,\nwith the aim of providing the technical support required to achieve a successful market development program so as to expand market access for its stakeholders' timber products. (TPC Annual Report 2003-2004 p2).\n\nThe TPC gained funding from the Victorian sawmilling sector through royalties collected by the Department of Sustainability and Environment (DSE) and through grants from industry bodies. Funds were also received from the sale of timber related publications and the delivery of external consultancies. (TPC Annual Report 2003-2004 p2)\n\nThe Forests (Timber Promotion Council) Regulations 2004 were revoked as of the 30th of August 2005 under the instrument of the Forests (Timber Promotion Council) (Revocation) Regulations 2005.

Section 11 of these define the powers and functions of the TPC as being:\n- The Council is to provide advice to the Secretary on timber promotion,\n- The Council must use the money made available to it to promote the use of timber."

    "title": "Port Phillip Authority",
    "description": "The Port Phillip Authority was established under the provisions of the Port Phillip Authority Act 1966 (No.6498).\n\nFunctions of the Authority were:\n\n- co-ordination of development in the Port Phillip Area to c.1984\n\n- preserving existing beaches and natural resources and preventing deterioration of the foreshore to c.1984.\n\n- improving facilities (including recreational facilities) in the area to c.1984.\n\nThe coastal management functions undertaken by the Port Phillip Authority included:\n\n- conducting surveys, investigations and experiments to determine the condition, pollution and usage of the foreshore and beaches\n\n- issuing consents for works, developments and removal of vegetation from land in the Port Phillip Area. Under Section 6 of the Port Phillip Authority Act 1966 no structure can be erected or works undertaken on or vegetation removed from any land in the Port Phillip Area without the consent of the Port Phillip Authority (except by the Melbourne Harbour Trust or actions exempted by the Governor-in-Council on the recommendation of the Authority).\n\n- assisting in the preparation of Management Plans for the area\n\nBackground\n\nThe Port Phillip Area comprises public land including foreshore and inshore waters around Port Phillip Bay and between Cape Schanck and Barwon Heads (this latter area of control until 1980 only). Various bodies with statutory powers have specific responsibilities relating to either the Bay or the foreshore, such as Committees of Management, municipalities or public authorities. The Port Phillip Authority was established in order to co-ordinate development as a result of this the multiplicity of control, management and responsibility.\n\nReservation of coastal public land\n\nMost coastal land was originally reserved for public use according to a set of orders made in the 1870s and 1880s. Reservation was intended to guarantee public access to water by preventing the sale of any further Crown lands adjoining water bodies.\n\nCoastal margins were originally retained to facilitate water transport and associated land access. In non-port areas they were usually regarded as easements, rights of way or land banks for possible future developments. Crown frontages to Port Phillip Bay were created as early as the late 1830s and from the early 1850s they were identified by surveyors as a matter of course right around the bay. Some of the beaches close to Melbourne were specially reserved as parks, gardens or for recreation in the mid and late 1860s but most were not given firm protection until 1873 when legislative steps were taken to remove a loophole which had allowed coastal land to be converted to freehold under section 42 of the Land Act 1865. In June 1873 all \"unappropriated\" Crown lands along the shores of Port Phillip Bay were permanently reserved. The remainder of the coastline was reserved over the next decade and on the 23 May 1881 a blanket reservation was made of all unalienated land within 1 and a half chains of the colony's \" Rivers, Rivulets, Creeks, Channels, Aqueducts, Lakes, Reservoirs, Swamps, Inlets, Loughs and Straits\".\n\nCoastal public land so reserved has traditionally been occupied on an annual permit or licence basis. These occupations generally fall under two categories: those for activities associated with recreational use of the frontage and adjoining waters, such as jetties, boatsheds, bathing boxes, boat and swimming club-houses, refreshment booths etc. Permits are issued by the local controlling body, usually the municipal council; the second form of occupation is for grazing licenses where there is little or no public usage and no local controlling body. These licences are issued by the central government department responsible for the public lands function.\n\nIn addition special legislation has on occasions allowed proprietary rights to coastal lands for certain purposes. For instance, in St. Kilda, an Act in 1965 allowed the municipal council to enter into leases for a specified portion of the shore reserve for a maximum term of 50 years for the provision of a marina and restaurant. In 1967 statutory provision was made for leases for a maximum term of 21 years for surf life-saving associations.\n\nCommittees of Management\n\nCoastal public lands, in the same way as many other public lands reserved for public purposes, are directly controlled by Committees of Management which are appointed by the Minister responsible for public lands. In most cases the local municipal council is appointed, in others, local individuals are elected to the committees. These Committees of Management may obtain advice from, and in some matters are subject to statutory control by, the government agencies which deal with fire protection, land conservation, planning etc. Some coastal public lands are controlled directly by port authorities and other statutory bodies.\n\nCo-ordination of coastal land management\n\nBy the mid 1960s it was realised that popular bayside and coastal beaches required measures for co-ordination of works and developments to ensure correct land use, the prevention of deterioration of the foreshore, the improvement of facilities and the identification and planned preservation of all natural assets. The Port Phillip Authority was established in 1966 to co-ordinate the development of the Port Phillip area and prevent further deterioration of the foreshore. Works and developments in the coastal zones defined as the Port Phillip Area had to be authorised by the Authority. The Port Phillip Coastal Planning and Management Act 1966 was repealed by the Planning and Environment Act 47/1987.\n\nIn 1978, under the provisions of the Crown Land (Reserves) Act 1978, (No.9212) the Coastal Management and Co-ordination Committee (CMCC) was established with responsibility for the oversight of management and protection of the coastline of Victoria, except that around Port Phillip Bay.\n\nIn 1983 responsibility for both the Port Phillip Authority and the CMCC was transferred to the Minister for Planning and Environment placing responsibility for planning and co-ordination of management of all coastal lands (except major ports and national parks) within the ambit of one department. Thus all planning, management, works, funding and protection of coastal resources, as well as assistance with the preparation of management plans, in conjunction with other government agencies, committees of management and coastal municipalities, were administered by the newly established Coastal Unit within the Ministry of Planning and Environment. The Minister was responsible for approval of management plans, changes to plans and changes in use and development, and approval of leases, licences and permits.\n\nAbolition of the Port Phillip Authority\n\nIt is not clear exactly when the Port Phillip Authority ceased to exist but it would appear that the Coasts, Open Space and Waterways Branch within the Ministry for Planning and Environment undertook its functions after its demise around the early 1980s until the repeal in early 1988 of the Port Phillip Coastal Planning and Management Act 1966 by the Planning and Environment Act 47/1987 s.205.\n\nAfter the PPA Act was repealed in early 1988 the controls provided for in the Act were incorporated into the State Section of statutory plans and both the Minister for Planning and Environment (VRG 65) and the Minster for Conservation, Forests and Lands (VRG 75) were made Referral Authorities to consider and approve permits for works and developments in the Port Phillip Area. This statutory referral advice was co-ordinated at the State level through an Ad-hoc Committee established under the auspices of the Coastal Management and Co-ordination Committee."

    "description": "Establishment\n\nThe Liquor Control Act 1968 (No.7695) came into operation on 1 July 1968 on which date the Liquor Control Commission was constituted. This Act incorporated a number of recommendations of the Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Sale, Supply, Disposal or Consumption of Liquor in Victoria which commenced in 1963. It marked the end of the system of Licensing Magistrates and Licensing Courts which had operated for over 100 years. The Commission took over the functions previously exercised by the Victorian Licensing Court (VA 2905) and the Licences Reduction Board (VA 2906).\n\nFunctions\n\nThe object of the Act was to ensure the orderly and continuous improvement in, and the development of, facilities for the supply of accommodation, meals and liquor to the public. The Commission was responsible for establishing standards in these areas and ensuring that they were met. It also had the authority to issue or cancel licences. In addition the Act established a new provision whereby the Commission could suspend a licence for a period of time.\n\nNumerous alterations were made in the licensing law and practice of the State, the 1968 Act completely re-writing the law. All fees taken under the Act and all fines, penalties, forfeitures, and moneys incurred or accruing under it were paid into the Licensing Fund set up under the Licensing Act 1958 (No.6293).\n\nThe power to increase or decrease the number of licenses issued in certain areas was also afforded to the Commission. Determinations in this respect were usually made on the basis of recommendations from local councils. A completely new code of compensation was set out under the new Act with payments made from the Licensing Fund.\n\nThe system of Licensing Inspectors continued, the duties of inspecting premises and enforcing the provisions of the Act being undertaken by nominated members of the police force not below the rank of sub-inspector.\n\nConstitution of the Commission\n\nThe Licensing Court (VA 2905) of three members was replaced by the Liquor Control Commission of four members, the chairman being a County Court Judge with a tenure of 7 years. This practice was discontinued in 1976 as a result of the Liquor Control (Chairman) Act 1975 (No.8761) enacted on 18 November 1975 and proclaimed on 4 December 1975. The change meant that the chairman could be a \"judicial member\" and could retain office until the age of 72 years.\n\nMinisterial Responsibility\n\nMinisterial responsibility for liquor licensing altered frequently in the period from 1979 to 1985. The Liquor Control Commission was responsible to:\n\n( the Minister for Labour and Industry (VRG 42) between 1979-1982;\n( the Minister for Tourism (VRG 89) for a brief period in 1982;\n( the Minister for Economic Development (VRG 71) between 1982 and 1983;\n( the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Technology (VRG 77) between 1983 and 1985;\n( the Minister for Industry, Technology and Resources (VRG 82) from 1985.\n\nCessation of the Commission\n\nFrom 1968 to 1988 when the Commission was replaced by the Liquor Licensing Commission (VA 2869) several new types of licences were introduced but the system of registration of licensing remained basically the same. In October 1984 Dr J.P. Nieuwenhuysen undertook a comprehensive review which concluded that licensing practice in Victoria was restrictive and outdated and did not meet the demands imposed by recent social changes. The Government reacted by legislating to effect certain changes to licensing operations and the Liquor Licensing Commission commenced operation on 3 May 1988 under the provisions of the Liquor Control Act 1987.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nA significant collection of records of the Commission and its predecessors is held at the Public Record Office, including long runs of Licensing Registers.

The central administration was to be responsible for maintaining effective co-ordination within and between education sectors and for developing state wide policy frameworks within which local decision-making could occur.\n\nStructure and Responsibilities of the Ministry\n\nBy 1989 the Ministry of Education consisted of the Minister for Education and the Minister responsible for Post Secondary Education (first appointed in May 1989, replacing the Minister Assisting the Minister with Responsibility for Post Secondary Education, first appointed in December 1987), a Chief Executive, the Office of Schools Administration, several central administration branches and divisions including the Division of Further Education and the Education Executive Committee. The Education Executive Committee consisted of the Chief Executive and the Chief General Manager of the Office of Schools Administration, the General Manager Division of Further Education and the chairpersons of the State Training Board, State Board of Education, Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Board and the Victorian Post-Secondary Education Commission, all of which were major statutory authorities within the portfolio.\n\nThe Ministry also included the following minor statutory authorities and boards\n\n- Institute of Educational Administration\n- Registered Schools Board\n- Teachers Registration Board\n- Teaching Services Appeals Board\n- TAFE Discipline Appeals Board,\n- TAFE Teaching Service Appeals Board\n- TAFE Teaching Service Registration Board, and the\n- Victorian Post-Secondary Education Accreditation Board.\n\nOffice of Schools Administration\n\nIn 1988 following an amendment to the Public Service Act 1974, the former Schools Division was established as the Office of Schools Administration, an associated administrative unit of the Ministry of Education. Although there was little change in functional responsibility, the new Office had greater autonomy.\n\nThe Office of Schools Administration was responsible for providing thirteen years of comprehensive quality education to students in over 2,100 Government primary and post-primary schools across Victoria. In Victoria, school attendance is compulsory from six to fifteen years of age. Branches of the State Office, eight regional offices and forty-two school support centres supported schools in their work in line with Government educational priorities which included the devolution of authority to the school community; collaborative decision-making; an administration which was to be responsive to the needs of schools; an excellent education for every child; and the redress of disadvantage and discrimination. Curriculum policy was set by each school council within these principles and with the assistance of curriculum frameworks.\n\nPrograms and Services\n\nIn 1989 the Ministry was responsible for a number of key educational programmes.\n\nThe Students with Disabilities Program provided for the development of educational programs and school-based resources for disabled students in regular schools. Eighty-six special schools provided an alternative program for students with disabilities.\n\nThe Aboriginal Mentor Program worked to create a supportive environment for Aboriginal students by developing a partnership between the students, parents, their teachers and community members. It aimed to improve the participation and achievement of Aboriginal students in post-primary education, particularly in the post-compulsory years of schooling.\n\nThe Program also aimed to provide support and assistance for upper primary Aboriginal students and aid the transition of students between post-primary schools and tertiary education and training.\n\nThe Disadvantaged Schools Program provided funding for those schools with the highest concentrations of students from disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds.\n\nThese schools also received assistance in the development of curriculum to redress educational disadvantage.\n\nThe Literacy Program encompassed a number of projects linked to directions set out in the English Curriculum Framework for the years of compulsory schooling.\n\nThe Multicultural Education Program focused on the provision of high quality curriculum and language programs for people of different religious, geographic or ethnic backgrounds. Programs included Languages Other Than English (L.O.T.E.) and English as a Second Language (ESL).\n\nThe Numeracy Program was designed to improve numeracy skills in accordance with the Mathematics Framework for the years of compulsory schooling.\n\nThe Women and Girls' Program aimed to broaden the post-school options for women and girls through a broadening of curriculum choice and career aspirations. It promoted the development of a supportive school environment, an inclusive curriculum and adequate resources.\n\nFunctional Divisions within the Ministry\n\nSeveral specialised units were responsible for facilitating the integration of children with impairments, disabilities or other problems into a regular school environment; for developing strategies to facilitate the re-organisation of schools; for co-ordinating and implementing processes to assist school evaluation and for providing advice and assistance to School Councils and Regional Boards.\n\nThe Schools Programs Division was responsible for the development of policies, guidelines and programs in the area of curriculum and social justice and for program evaluation and review. The Curriculum Programs section was responsible for providing advice to schools on school curriculum and organisation, curriculum content and teaching strategies. The Curriculum Projects Section developed educational programs, developed and disseminated course materials and curriculum information and undertook research projects.\n\nThe Social Justice section was responsible for co-ordinating the policy functions of several of the key educational programs including disadvantaged schools, students with disabilities, multicultural education, women and girls and Aboriginal Education Services which conducted special education programs for Aboriginal people; provided special teachers; employed Aboriginal teacher aides and Aboriginal cultural officers; ran Aboriginal Learning Centres for post-primary and adult students; provided information and support services and involved Aboriginal people in the development and operation of these programs.\n\nThe Across Division Section developed policies, guidelines and programs in the areas of computer education, equal educational opportunity, extension education, information systems related to educational settings and transition from primary to post-primary school and from school to work.\n\nThe eight Regional Offices were responsible for all matters relating to the administration and management of the school system, apart from the staffing and industrial relations functions managed by the Personnel and Industrial Relations Operations Section. Regional responsibilities included education programs, planning and support services for schools, non-teaching personnel, finance and facilities. Regional Boards were comprised of representatives of school councils in the region, representatives of state-wide parent, school council, teacher and local parent associations and representatives of the Ministry. Regional general managers sought the advice of Regional Boards on resource priorities and allocations and informed the Boards of State Office decisions on management of finance and facilities, employment of ancillary staff, promotion of school community relationships, and other areas of school operations.\n\nThe Division of Further Education was responsible for developing and implementing policies in relation to further education, in co-operation with other agencies working in the sector. Its responsibilities included the operations of the Council of Adult Education and the Adult Migrant Education Service. Its particular aim was to ensure the efficient, effective and equitable delivery of further education programs to targeted groups (such as disadvantaged people) and to support community providers. The Division was supported by eleven regional Councils of Further Education which advised the Minister on the needs for further education and how best to meet those needs in their region. The Adult Migrant Education Services section was responsible for the planning and delivery of English language programs for adults of non-English speaking background. It was the major service provider in Victoria of the national Adult Migrant Education Program.\n\nFunction Transfers\n\nIn 1987 the Ministry assumed responsibility for:\n\n- school attendance from the Department of Community Services (VA 2633)\n- industrial and apprenticeship training from the Department of Labour II (VA 2777)\n and\n- the Industrial Training Commission (VA 900).\n\nIn 1990 responsibility for the provision of school bus services other than those to special and special development schools was transferred from:\n\n- the Ministry of Education to the Ministry of Transport (VA 673).\n\nFrom 1 January 1991 responsibility for pre-school and child care programs previously administered by the Ministry of Education was transferred to:\n\n- the Office of Pre-School and Child Care within the Department of Community Services (VA 2633).\n\nResponsibility for state administration of national Children's Week was transferred from:\n\n- the Department of Premier and Cabinet (VA 1039) to the Ministry as part of machinery of government changes in early 1991, and subsequently transferred to the Department of School Education (VA 3029) as part of administrative changes in October 1991 (see below).\n\nFor information about the role and responsibilities of the statutory authorities and boards within the Ministry, see VRG 35 Education. For further information about individual institutions see VRG 24 Educational Institutions.\n\nAbolition of the Ministry of Education and Training and Administrative Change in the Period October 1991 to October 1992:\n\nIn January 1991, the Ministry of Education became the Ministry of Education and Training, but the change in name did not represent a change in functional responsibilities. The intention, according to the official press release issued by the Premier's Office, was to more clearly reflect the importance that training will play in Victoria's economic recovery.\n\nIn October 1991, further administrati... truncated"

    "title": "Technical and Further Education Board",
    "description": "Prior to the establishment of the Technical and Further Education Board (VA 1176) in 1980, the central administration and co-ordination of TAFE programs had been the responsibility of the Technical Schools Services Division of the Education Department (VA 714).\n\nTechnical education had its genesis in the establishment of Schools of Mines and industries and Mechanics Institutes in the nineteenth century. Courses offered by these institutions had a vocational orientation. The first technical institutes were the Schools of Mines established in the 1870s at Ballarat, Bendigo and the Working Mens' College (later Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology) established in 1887. These and a number of other technical colleges received government grants but they were under the control of their own councils. Eleven such colleges were established. Senior Technical Schools and Colleges established after 1911 were under the direct control of the Education Department.\n\nSenior technical colleges traditionally offered trade technician certificate and diploma courses in a wide range of technical and scientific fields, including apprenticeship trades, architecture, art, building, commerce, management, public administration and the various branches of engineering and metallurgy, pure and applied science.\n\nFrom 1965 following the release of the report of the Committee on the Future of Tertiary Education in Australia (Martin Committee), the Commonwealth Government assumed responsibility for the funding of diploma level courses. It thus became necessary for colleges to separate the administration of diploma courses from that of technical and trade courses. Colleges offering diploma and degree level studies became known as Institutes of Technology or Colleges of Advanced Education. Such colleges were affiliated to the Victoria Institute of Colleges (VA 571) and were responsible to the Commonwealth Commission on Advanced Education.\n\nPost secondary, technical and vocational education, and adult and community education programs continued to be provided through technical schools, Education Department technical colleges and the technical colleges associated with some of the colleges of advanced education. From 1973, this sector of education became known as TAFE or Technical and Further Education. The Australian Committee on Technical and Further Education (ACOTAFE), frequently referred to as the Kangan Committee after its Chairman, was established in 1973. This committee argued that TAFE had been a neglected area of education and recommended its development be enhanced through the provision of Commonwealth funding to the States. At state level, the State Council of Technical Education provided advice to the Minister of Education.\n\nIn August 1976, the Victorian Government established a committee of Enquiry into Post-Secondary Education (Partridge Committee). This committee reported in February 1978 and recommended that a Victorian Post-Secondary Education Commission be established to advise the Victorian Government and relevant Commonwealth authorities on all aspects of the development, operation, co-ordination and funding of post-secondary education in Victoria. The committee also recommended that a Board of Technical and Further Education be established to advise the commission on the development, operation, co-ordination and funding of all institutions engaged in TAFE and that the capital and recurrent funding of TAFE be greatly increased. In 1978, the Victorian Post-Secondary Education Commission (VPSEC) (VA 721) was established under the provisions of the Post-Secondary Education Act 1978 (No. 9145).\n\nEstablishment of the Technical and Further Education Board\n\nIn July 1980 the TAFE Board (VA 1176) was established under the provisions of section 15A of the Post-Secondary Education Act 1978. As the state authority for technical and further education, the TAFE Board was responsible to the Victorian Post-Secondary Education Commission (VPSEC) and derived its powers and functions from an Instrument of Delegation which enabled it to exercise certain of VPSEC's powers.\n\nFunctions\n\nEssentially the TAFE Board was authorised to:\n - determine policy on matters relating to TAFE subject and guidelines imposed by the relevant Ministers\n - determine the distribution of funds available for TAFE\n - authorise and accredit new TAFE courses and major developments of existing courses\n - make recommendations to relevant Ministers on any matters relating to TAFE\n\nTAFE Programs and Providers\n\nIn defining the parameters of its responsibility, the TAFE Board accepted the definition of TAFE established by the Australian Council of Technical and Further Education. TAFE was thus defined to include the acquisition by full time or part time studies of occupational qualifications involving mental, manual or social skills and the acquisition usually on a part time basis of skills for secondary, additional or supplementary occupational purposes, for personal development or for the creative utilisation of leisure.\n\nAt the time of the TAFE Board's establishment, there were three broad groupings of courses - vocational, preparatory and recreational. The national classification of TAFE courses consisted of six streams namely:\n\nProfessional\n - a relatively minorTAFE activity in Victoria which included two specialist diplomas and the provision of the early years of diploma and degree studies\n\nMiddle Levels\n - programmes designed to train support personnel for professional officers and senior management; full certificate courses and special purpose programs to enable para-professionals to update their areas of specialisation\n\nBasic Vocational (Apprenticeship)\n - the provision of trade training in declared trades as determined by the Industrial Training Commission and the provision of pre and post apprenticeship courses\n\nBasic Vocational (Non-Apprenticeship)\n - a range of courses from training comparable to apprenticeship but in occupations which were not proclaimed trades to short courses conducted for particular employers\n\nAccess\n - programs designed to permit student admission to vocational education, tertiary education or to assist in transition to employment. Courses included special access programs for disadvantaged students, preparatory apprentice and tertiary orientation\n\nRecreational\n - all non-vocational programs of a cultural or utilitarian nature provided for the community in general.\n\nTAFE courses were classified into eleven broad fields of study: applied science, art and design, building, business studies, engineering, rural and horticulture, music, paramedical, industrial services, personal services and general services.\n\nTAFE courses were provided in a variety of situations. These included two TAFE colleges controlled by their own councils, eight TAFE components of colleges affiliated with the Victoria Institute of Colleges, twenty-one colleges established under the Schools Councils Act, TAFE sections in some eighty technical schools, the Army Apprentice School, agriculture and horticultural colleges under the control of the Department of Agriculture, evening classes in high schools, technical components in high schools, courses conducted by the Council of Adult of Education, community education programmes conducted by voluntary learning groups.\n\nIn addition to the courses offered through these means, a highly developed off-campus studies network allowed students to study many TAFE courses at home.\n\nRe-organisation of TAFE\n\n1980-1981\nFollowing a review of the organisation and administration of TAFE in Victoria, the TAFE Board recommended that:\n - the state wide administration of TAFE be separated from the Education Department\n - a small unit responsible directly to the TAFE Board be established to assist in the foundation and implementation of its policy decisions\n - Regional TAFE Boards be established throughout Victoria to make decisions and recommendations regarding the most rational use of regional resources within the framework of the TAFE Board and Government policy\n - all providers of TAFE to remain responsible for the administration of their own programs within the context of state and regional policy decisions.\n\nThe recommendations of the TAFE Board were substantially accepted by the Government and in 1981 ten country and five metropolitan regional TAFE Boards were appointed. Subsequently seventeen TAFE colleges were separated from the administration of the Education Department and then operated under the Post-Secondary Act. These colleges, together with a further eleven colleges associated with Colleges of Advanced Education, Council of Adult Education, Department of Agriculture and the Education Department which continued to provide TAFE courses through technical schools and some high schools, became the major TAFE providers responsible to the Board.\n\n1982-1983\nIn 1982 following a change of government, the new Minister of Education announced a review of the organisation and structure of TAFE in Victoria. The review was conducted by the Victorian Public Service Board in conjunction with a representative Working Party established for this purpose. In 1983, many of the recommendations of the Review report were implemented under the provisions of the Post-Secondary Education (Amendment) Act 1983 (No. 9933). A new TAFE Board was formally established. While VPSEC retained responsibility for the overall co-ordination of post-secondary education including TAFE, the new Board had greater autonomy and control over its own budget.\n\nThe 1983 legislation also established regional TAFE Boards, TAFE Teaching Service, TAFE Teaching Service Appeals Board, TAFE Discipline Appeals Board, TAFE Teaching Registration Board and a TAFE Accreditation Board.\n\nFunctions of the new TAFE Board\n\nUnder section 43 of the Post-Secondary Education Act, the functions of the new TAFE Board were to:\n - administer, plan and co-ordinate TAFE in Victoria in co-operation with VPSEC and to enhance opportunities for access to such education\n - determine community needs in relation to TAFE; take account of training needs as determined by the Ministry of Employment and Training and devise means of meeting such needs more effectively\n - make reports and recommendations to the Minister, VPSEC and Commonwealth authorities on the development of TAFE, establishment of new TAFE institutions and the allocation of funds amongst TAFE regions and institutions\n - undertake research projects and investigations to ensure that TAFE facilities were able to meet changing financial, economic and social circumstances.\n\nIn consultation with the Industrial Training Commission and the TAFE Accreditation Board, the TAFE Board was also responsible for the accreditation of courses, for the maintenance of a Register of Accredited Courses and for determining which institutions had the authority to conduct courses.\n\nAbolition of the TAFE Board\n\nIn 1987 there was a radical re-organisation of the state training system. Under the provisions of the State Training Board Order 1987, a State Training Board (VA 3002) was established to co-ordinate and administer the Government's training policies and the technical and vocational training services provided by the State and public authorities. The order took effect from 30 November 1987. The State Training Board effectively assumed responsibility for functions previously performed by the training division of the Department o... truncated"

    "description": "Creation and Functions\n\nThe Bendigo College of Advanced Education (Bendigo C.A.E.) was established in 1976 by the merging of the Bendigo Institute of Technology (VA 3091) with the State College of Victoria at Bendigo (VA 3090). Both the Bendigo Institute of Technology and the State College of Victoria at Bendigo are previous agencies to the Bendigo C.A.E.\n\nThe primary aims of Bendigo C.A.E. (as specified in its FOI Part II Statement) were to function as an agent of decentralisation and equalisation of educational opportunity:\n by providing a wide range of tertiary educational opportunities for people of northern and central Victoria;\n by encouraging enrolments from other parts of Australia and from overseas to maintain vigour and diversity at the college and promote the value of regional living.\n\nSuperior Agency\n\nBendigo C.A.E. was incorporated in 1976 under section 29B of the Victoria Institute of Colleges Act. It was thus affiliated with the VA 571 Victoria Institute of Colleges (V.I.C.). The VIC exercised control over its member colleges' and institutes' staff establishments, salary scales, major financial and building programs, general oversight of academic standards and the awarding of degrees. The colleges and institutes, however, were controlled by their own independent councils with authority over staff appointments, enrolments and instruction, arrangement of courses, and financial management within the budget allocated by the V.I.C. The V.I.C. was therefore a superior agency to its member colleges and institutes, in this case, Bendigo C.A.E.\n\nThe Post-Secondary Education (Amendment) Act 1980 abolished the V.I.C. VA 721 Victorian Post-Secondary Education Commission (VPSEC), which had been established under the Post-Secondary Education Act 1978, assumed some of the administrative responsibility previously held by the V.I.C. but, by and large, associated educational institutions governed themselves more independently under VPSEC than they were able to under the V.I.C. VPSEC retained some control of academic standards, course accreditation, and the distribution of recurrent and capital funding while exercising a more general coordinating role and providing advice on funding and community needs to both the State and Federal governments. VPSEC was therefore not a superior agency to the Bendigo C.A.E.\n\nSubsequent Agencies\n\nBy 1981 the Bendigo C.A.E. operated a Technical and Further Education Division which was known as the Bendigo Technical College. The Technical College remained part of the Bendigo C.A.E. until 29 June 1983 when the Council of Bendigo college of Technical and Further Education was constituted a body corporate under Section 23 (2) of the Post-Secondary Education Act. From that time onwards VA 1197 Bendigo College of Technical and Further Education became a separate, independent institution.\n\nFrom 1 January 1991 the Bendigo College of Advanced Education affiliated with La Trobe University (VA 1184) and offered courses as La Trobe University College of Northern Victoria (L.T.U.C.N.V.).\n\nLocation of the Records\n\nSee list below and List of Holdings 1985, Section 5.21.0. for records of VA 1186 Bendigo College of Advanced Education and its previous agencies and Section 5.222.0 for records of VA 571 Victoria Institute of Colleges. Other records of the Bendigo C.A.E. are held by the archives of the La Trobe University College of Northern Victoria (VA 3089) which assumed responsibility in 1991."

The working party's report, released in 1975 resolved to revoke the previous licence and set up two divisions of the company, VA 1192 Swinburne Institute of Technology and VA 4668 Swinburne College of TAFE. The licence was officially revoked on 4th April 1975, and the working party's resolutions were put into effect on 14th April 1975. From 1975, these two divisions were administered separately.\n\nArising from the martin Report 1965, the Federal Government introduced matching financial grants to colleges of Advanced Education. The Victoria Institute of Colleges (VA 571) was established and Swinburne Institute of Technology became an affiliated college.\n\nThis form of funding for tertiary education necessitated a separation of tertiary from non-tertiary courses. This separation was reflected in the structure of Swinburne College of Technology (VA 1217), prompting it to divide into a Higher Education and TAFE division\n\nSwinburne Institute of Technology incorporated the Higher Education division of the former Swinburne College of Technology. After an extensive reorganisation of Victorian Advanced Education, which saw the Victorian Institute of Colleges replaced by the Victorian Post-Secondary Education Commission, the Council of Swinburne Institute of Technology were given the power to grant bachelor degrees. The first of these was awarded in 1981 on Thursday 21st of May at a conferring ceremony held at the Camberwell Civic Centre. Before this time, bachelor degrees for students who studied at Swinburne Institute of Technology were conferred, along with students of other institutions, as part of Victoria Institute of Colleges degree conferring ceremonies.\n\nSwinburne Institute of Technology merged with Swinburne College of Technical And Further Education (VA 4668) and Prahran College of TAFE as a result of the Swinburne University of Technology Act 1992 (Act No. 44)."

    "description": "Sunraysia College of Technical and Further Education was established in 1979. It was the first purpose-designed and built TAFE college in Victoria. The TAFE was designed to provide a teaching program which would meet the needs of the community and industry, as well as providing training access to those livng in remote regional areas of north-west Victoria. It was also established with a tri-state focus due to its unique location near the border of Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia.\n\nIt was renamed to Sunraysia Institute of Technical and Further Education on 2 October 1995 (Victoria Government Gazette, No. S 77, Friday 4 August 1995).\n\nTo reflect the industry base of the region, main areas of study include agriculture, horticulture, building, construction and associated trades, light and heavy automotive, community health, welfare, business and retail and hospitality services. Later education stream focuses include future trades, the expansion of traditional trades, health and social assistance industries and sustainability qualifications.\n\nSunraysia Institute of TAFE has two main campuses at Mildura and Swan Hill; two rural campuses at Robinvale and Ouyen; and a training farm at Cardross, near Mildura.\n\nThe main Mildura campus partnered with La Trobe University and the Murray Darling Freshwater Research Centre, hosted the Sunraysia branch of University of The Third Age, the National Centre for Sustainability, the Sunraysia Branch of Men's Shed, and TAFE Kids (an incorporated childcare centre)."

    "description": "The Eastern Suburbs Technical College (later to become Swinburne Technical College) was established in 1908 at the instigation of the Hon. George Swinburne MLA and others who recognised the demand for technical training in the Eastern Suburbs. It was registered as a company limited by guarantee on 8 July 1908 as per the Companies Act 1890 (No. 1074). Information about the forming of the Eastern Suburbs Technical College can be found within VPRS 932/P1 unit 52 file 4303 - Swinburne Technical College.\n\nIn accordance with the Companies Act [Amendment] 1896 (No. 1482), an inaugural meeting of the council was held at which George Swinburne was elected as President of the Council, with Mr GG Mercy Vice President, Sir William McPherson honorary treasurer, and Mr HR Hamer Honorary Director. At the time, George Swinburne was Minister for Water Supply, and Minister for Agriculture. Previously, he had been the Mayor of Hawthorn.\n\nThe foundation stone for the original building in John Street Hawthorn was laid by the then Premier, Sir Thomas Bent, on 19 September 1908. In December 1908 the first Director of the college, Mr. JR Tranthim-Fryer, was appointed to undertake the task of appointing staff, devising the courses and enrolling students for the new college. Classes began in 1909, with the first classes offered being elementary carpentry, blacksmithing and plumbing. Second term introduced classes in art and fitting and turning.\n\nAlthough earlier Education Acts existed, it was not until the Education Act 1911 (No 2301) that Technical Schools were formally incorporated into Education legislation. This followed a number of Royal Commissions into Education, including the Fink Royal Commission of 1899-1901.\n\n1911 also saw the introduction of new classes at Swinburne, including cooking, dressmaking and millinery classes. In 1913 Diploma classes in Engineering were offered and the graduates from this course were the first students from the college to receive a professional qualification.\n\nIn the absence of George Swinburne, the Council voted to change the name of the Eastern Suburbs Technical School to Swinburne Technical School in August 1912. The change in name however, was not officially notified in the Government Gazette for over two years.\n\nA Boy's Junior School was established in 1913 and Dr. D MacKay was appointed as Headmaster. Competition for places at the school was fierce, and overcrowding continued until 1962 when the Boy's School was transferred to a new site on Burwood Road, east of William Street.\n\nThe success of the Boy's School led to the establishment of the first Australian technical school for girls in 1916. The Girl's Technical School was originally located in a house on the corner of Burwood Road and John Street until the site was needed for a new hall to mark the college's jubilee in 1958 when it was relocated to a row of cottages in William Street. The conditions in William Street were extremely cramped but the school remained there until it merged with the Boy's school in 1968. In 1969, the council relinquished control of the secondary school, which continued to be operated by the Education Department.\n\nArising from the martin Report 1965, the Federal Government introduced matching financial grants to colleges of Advanced Education. The Victoria Institute of Colleges (VA 571) was established and Swinburne Institute of Technology became an affiliated college. This form of funding for tertiary education necessitated a separation of tertiary from non-tertiary courses. This separation was reflected in the structure of Swinburne College of Technology (VA 1217), prompting it to divide into a Higher Education and TAFE division\n\nAs a result of increased funding, Swinburne began to improve the standard of its buildings and salaries offered to staff. Increasing numbers of students enrolled in the ever-growing range of courses offered. The range of courses and the various levels at which they were offered grew to such an extent that in 1969, the boys' and girls' technical schools were taken over by the Victorian Education Department while the college remained as an autonomous institution.\n\nSwinburne changed its name to Swinburne College of Technology on March 12th 1968, and continued to run under this name until 1975. Swinburne had been incorporated under s.24 (5) of the Companies Act 1961, in 1973 a working party was established to determine the most appropriate form of incorporation. The working party's report, released in 1975 resolved to revoke the previous licence and set up two divisions of the company - VA 1192 Swinburne Institute of Technology and VA 4668 Swinburne College of TAFE. The licence was officially revoked on 4th of April 1975 by the Attorney General, and the working party's resolutions put into effect from 14th April 1975. The Articles of Association were revised to incorporate the changes to Swinburne College of Technology Limited. From 1975, these two divisions were administered separately."

Salary was to be determined by classification. The Classifiers were to determine the promotion or transfer of teachers to permanent vacancies\n\nAmendments to the Act in 1905 changed the structure of the Committee to constitute it of the Chief Inspectors, a Class 1 head teacher and a non-service government nominee. The Teachers Act 1925 established two committees - one for the Primary and one for the secondary Division. The Committee then in office became the Committee of Classifiers for the Primary Division. The third Committee of Classifiers - for the Technical Division - was established by the provisions of the Teaching Service Act 1946.\n\nThe three committees continued until 1981 to regulate the classification of teachers in government schools. Positions for transfer or promotion of qualified permanent teachers were advertised in the Education Gazette with the Committee determining appointments. All permanent teachers were classified and listed on the Classified Roll."

    "description": "Background\n\nThe Sisters of Mercy arrived in Melbourne from Perth in 1857 to open the first school to be conducted by a religious order in Victoria. Around 1919, they commenced hospital work in Melbourne. In 1920, Rev. Mother M. Francis and five Sisters of Mercy formed the nucleus of the hospital staff at St. Benedicts in Malvern.\n\nThe Hospitals and Charities Commission registered the Mercy Maternity Hospital Society as a \"benevolent society\" under the provisions of the Hospitals and Charities Act.\n\nIn 1926 with the support of the Catholic Archbishop of Melbourne, application was made to the Victorian Government for permission to establish a Public Hospital. This was refused as the Government considered the needs of the time called for intermediate and Private Hospital accommodation. As a result of this decision, planning commenced for the Mercy Private Hospital which later opened at East Melbourne in 1935.\n\nThe Mercy Private Hospital was registered by the Hospitals and Charities Commission under the provisions of the Health Act. The hospital was owned by the Property Association of the Sisters of Mercy.\n\nThe 1940's brought further discussions with the Catholic Archbishop of Melbourne who expressed his support and encouragement for the establishing of a Public Maternity Hospital, subject to the needs of the community and the availability of finance from the State Government. In 1964, the State Government granted approval to commence planning for the Mercy Public Maternity Hospital. The Mercy Maternity plan was launched as \"Public Hospital\". An appeal to the public and business firms in 1964 raised $ 1 million.\n\nEstablishment\nMercy Maternity Hospital was opened in 1971 and was included in Table B of the Health Commission Act, 1977, No 9023 and the Health Services Act 1988, No 49 as a subsidised incorporated institution.\n\nIn 1986, the Sisters of Mercy handed over legal responsibility for the conduct of the Hospital to the Board of Management. Incorporation of the Hospital under the Associations Incorporation Act 1981 saw full legal responsibility for all policy matters vested in a newly constituted Board of Management. Previously the Board served in an advisory capacity only.\n\nThe hospital was required to provide maternity, nursing, administrative, financial and other services as was required by the Board of Management. The management of the Hospital vested in the Board which directed all the affairs of the Hospital.\n\nSubject to the requirements of the Health Services Act and the By-laws of the Hospital, the Board of Management exercised all powers of the Hospital including control of the funds, provision of all requisites for the use of the Hospital and the appointment and discharge of all members of the Medical Establishment, officers and staff, including the Chief Executive Officer and Secretary.\n\nThe Board of Management could appoint, from among its members the other persons, Advisory Committee for the purpose of advising the Board on particular matters.\n\nSuch committees have no executive authority but consider and research all matters to them by the Board and report their findings and recommendations to the Board. Additionally these Committees are required to initiate and communicate to the Board such ideas and advice as they consider appropriate.\n\nThere are Committees:\n\n- Responsible for general and financial administration of the hospital,\n- Committees responsible for medical and nursing administration of the hospital.\n-\nThe functional services of the Hospital are:\n- Chief Executive Officer's Office and General and Financial Administration, and\n- Medical and Nursing.\n\nIn 1988 -89 Sister Administrator and CEO roles were separated, General Services and Administration were merged and a Nursing Division was created. There were General, Medical and Nursing Divisions.\n\nIn 1991 the hospital was given a new name, Mercy Hospital for Women.\n\nIn 1994 Werribee Mercy Hospital was opened (Mercy Public Hospital Inc.)\n\nIn 1995, the Sisters of Mercy sought advice on governance and management structure that would ensure viability of Mercy health Care into the 21st century. In 1996 Mercy Health and Aged care was formed.\n\nIn 1997 the three divisions, General, Medical and Nursing, were amalgamated.\n\nIn May 2005 the hospital moved to a new building in Heidelberg.\n\nRecords\nA central location is maintained for correspondence and records in respect of matters dealt with by the Board of Management, the Chief Executive and Administrative Services.\n\n- Files are maintained by agency relating to an internal committee or department or external organisation or subject file of general nature or policy files of Medical, Nursing and Financial Services areas.\n\nOther records include:\n- Minutes of Board of Management and meetings of Advisory Committees to the Board and action statements of other Committees functioning within each functional area.\n\n- Title documents attesting ownership or use of real property, other security documents and contracts are evidenced by the Hospitals' copy of the legally drawn and executed instrument supported by appropriate documentation e.g. building plans and specifications.\n\n- Medical Record Files created for patients.\n\n- Records of employment history of employees of the hospital."

    "description": "In 1870 Dr William Smith and Dr John Singleton founded the Free Hospital for Sick Children in premises at 39 Stephen Street (now 49 Exhibition Street), Melbourne. The accepted foundation date is 9 September 1870, when the inaugural meeting of the ladies' Committee of Management took place under its first president, Mrs Frances Perry. The hospital provided a free dispensary and outpatient clinic on the ground floor and six beds for inpatients on the first floor.\n\nIn 1871 the hospital became known as the Melbourne Hospital for Sick Children. In 1873 a site of one acre thirty-four perches on the corner of Gatehouse Street and The Avenue was temporarily reserved and trustees of the site appointed in 1875, however because of its remoteness at the time the Committee did not favour the site and nothing was built there until the mid-1900s. Instead, the Committee acquired the former home of judge Redmond Barry on a one-and-a-half acre site in Carlton and after conversion, the new hospital was opened on 27 September 1876. Over almost a century, the Carlton site was to be extensively redeveloped and expanded through acquisition of adjoining properties.\n\nIn 1903 the Committee formally changed the name from Melbourne Free Hospital for Sick Children to Children's Hospital. With the enactment of the Hospitals and Charities Act 1922 the corporate name given was The Children's Hospital, changed back to Children's Hospital on 30 August 1944 (announced in the Government Gazette of 27 September 1944). The Gazette of 4 November 1953 announced a further change of the corporate name under Section 50 of the Hospitals and Charities Act 5300 (1948) to Royal Children's Hospital following approval of the Royal prefix by the hospital's patron, Her Majesty the Queen.\n\nAs the hospital in Carlton became increasingly inadequate for current needs, planning began for building a new children's hospital. In 1948 a ten acre site in Royal Park (on the north-west corner of Gatehouse Street and Flemington Road) was designated by the government as the site for the new Children's Hospital. Construction commenced on 15 November 1951, a new nurses' home was completed in 1956 and the new Royal Children's Hospital was opened by Her Majesty the Queen on 25 February 1963.\n\nAs part of an overall Victorian Government strategy, the Royal Children's Hospital and the Royal Women's Hospital were aggregated on 1 August 1995 to form the Women's and Children's Health Care Network (from 1 July 2000 known as Women's and Children's Health) (VA 5016). Under the Health Services Act 1988, the corporate status of both hospitals was cancelled and replaced with the new corporate entity, however both hospitals continued to operate under their own names within the Women's and Children's Health Care Network, each represented by their own Executive Director, and they continued to produce reports on an annual basis, first called 'The Year in Review' and later 'Quality of Care' reports. On 1 July 2004, the two hospitals were disaggregated from Women's and Children's Health and the Royal Children's Hospital incorporated under the Health Services Act 1988 under the direction of a new board. The governance arrangements, by-laws and terms of property transfer (including rights to records and files) from Women's and Children's Health to the re-established corporate entities was set out in some detail in Victoria Government Gazette no. S159 of 30 June 2004.\n\nIn the State Budget handed down on 3 May 2005, the Victorian Government announced funding for a new 340-bed hospital and upgrades of some existing facilities. Work on the site, located next to the existing hospital, commenced in 2007 and the first stage of the new hospital was officially opened by Her Majesty the Queen on 26 October 2011. The new hospital was built under a public-private partnership with Children's Health Partnership Pty Ltd, the site being leased back by the government over a 25-year period. At the time of writing (2013), most of the old hospital buildings have been demolished and stage 2 of the project is due to be completed by the end of 2014.\n\nOther Properties\n\nIn 1883 the Committee purchases a site in Holyrood Street, Brighton, and built the Brighton Convalescent Cottage, which was opened in December 1884. After it burnt down in 1909, a house called \"Edgecliff\" in Beach Road, Hampton, was purchased and renovated to accommodate convalescent, heliotherapy and poliomyelitis patients, which continued there until 1957. In 1926 a 20-acre property at Frankston (now Mount Eliza) was acquired and the new Orthopaedic Section was constructed and opened on 3 March 1930. The Orthopaedic Section provided special treatment for patients suffering from tuberculosis of the legs and spine and from poliomyelitis. Pressure on convalescent accommodation during polio epidemics was partly eased in 1936 through the donation by philanthropist C M Wilson of four acres in Sherbrooke together with funds to build and operate a convalescent cottage. This operated until 1957 when the cottage was sold and the function transferred to the Sherbrooke unit established in the Orthopaedic Section at Frankston. Similarly, changing patient profiles and funding pressures led to the closure of the Hampton Convalescent Home in 1958. The Orthopaedic Section continued to operate until 1971, when its function was taken over by the Handicapped Children's Centre (later Department of Child Development and Rehabilitation) at the Royal Park site and in 1973 the property was resumed by the government as part of the Mount Eliza Home for the Aged."

Mrs Frances Perry, wife of Melbourne's first Anglican Bishop and a group of ladies joined Dr J Maund and Dr R Tracy and Dean Macartney.\n\nAt this meeting it was decided to name the Hospital the Melbourne Lying-in Hospital and Infirmary for Diseases of Women and Children. The hospital was established under the control of a Ladies Committee or Committee of Management, of twenty members.\n\nThey were assisted by a Gentlemen's Committee for reference and counsel in case of need. The ladies were hands-on managers, meeting weekly and assuming responsibility for admission of patients, staff appointments and negotiating contracts with builders and suppliers. In 1870 the Gentlemen's and Ladies Committee merged, although the Annual Reports continue to list the two groups separately until 1972.\n\nThe first premises were in a leased house at 41Albert Street, East Melbourne.\n\nIn 1858 a land grant of 2 acres was obtained in Carlton. A new building was constructed and opened on 2 October 1858.\n\nIn 1859, the hospital commenced training of nurses and midwives. In 1865, training of medical students commenced.\n\nOn 19 December 1864 the Melbourne Lying-in Hospital and Infirmary for Diseases of Women and Children was incorporated under the provision of the Hospitals and Charitable Institutions Act (refer to Government Gazette 31 December 1864).\n\nThe Melbourne Lying-in Hospital and Infirmary for the Diseases Peculiar to Women and Children offered care to two categories of patients - lying-in and infirmary - the former being for obstetric or midwifery patients and the latter those with surgical or medical problems.\n\nIn the face of public attack over the high death rate among midwifery patients in 1875, allegedly due to the attachment of the Hospital to the Infirmary led to the opening of a new midwifery wing in 1888 - the Genevieve Ward Wing.\n\nMidwifery and Infirmary departments were separated in 1888 physically and administratively and the Midwifery Department moved into a new building in Cardigan Street.\n\nAlso, that year the number of Honorary Physicians was increased from four to eight, four in each department. The initial appointments in the Midwifery Department were all new honorary appointments: Felix Meyer, M U O'Sullivan, J W Dunbar Hooper and G Rothwell Adam. The four original honoraries elected to remain in the Infirmary Department: G H Fetherston, Thomas Rowan, W Balls-Headley and S J Burke.\n\nNames by which the hospital has been known over the years are:\n\n1856 - c.1886\nMelbourne Lying-in Hospital and Infirmary for Diseases of Women and Children\nc.1886 - c.1888\nMelbourne Lying-in Hospital and Infirmary for Diseases of Women\n\nc.1888 - c. 1943\nThe Women's Hospital and Infirmary for Diseases of Women\n\nc.1943 - 1954\nThe Women's Hospital\n\n1954 - 1995\nThe Royal Women's Hospital (royal warrant conferred by Queen Elizabeth II)\n\n1995 - 2004\nThe Royal Women's Hospital (as part of network) on 1 August 1995 the Women's and Children's Health Care Network (VA 5016) was formed incorporating the Royal Children's Hospital and the Royal Women's Hospital.

    "description": "Established in 1882, the Austin had five name changes that included the \"Austin Hospital for Incurables\" before becoming the Austin Hospital.\n\nMany of the clinical areas that the Austin is renowned for today have their roots in the hospital's early history. Cancer, for example, was one of the \"incurable\" illnesses first patients were admitted with. In the 1920s, the Austin Hospital began experimenting with \"X-ray\" treatment for cancers and by 1935 the Austin was the largest cancer hospital in Australia.\n\nAustin Health's current cancer services at Austin Hospital and Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital will be consolidated into a comprehensive centre on the Austin site, through a capital appeal for the Olivia Newton-John Cancer Centre.\n\nThe Austin's expertise in spinal injuries was developed from caring for \"incurables\" with paraplegia, and later in rehabilitating children who had survived polio and early victims of car accidents.\n\nRespiratory medicine at the Austin had is origins in consumption, or tuberculosis, and neurosciences care can be traced back to early stroke victims suffering paralysis.\n\nIn 1939, the first operating theatre and accommodation for acute medical and surgical patients was established.\n\nIn 1956, the Austin's comprehensive spinal injury treatment and rehabilitation services were fully operational. Four years later the Austin Hospital became a general hospital with the opening of the outpatient and casualty block.\n\nAn affiliation with The University of Melbourne commenced in 1965 when the Austin Hospital Clinical School was established. Austin Health now hosts The University of Melbourne's departments of medicine, surgery, psychiatry, psychology and physiotherapy.\n\nThe Austin Hospital and Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital amalgamated on 1 April 1995 to become Victoria's largest tertiary referral centre providing a broad range of patient services whilst enhancing established teaching and research profiles.\n\nFrom August 1995 to 31 October 1997, the Austin was part of the North Eastern Health Care Network. On 1 November 1997, the Austin again became a stand-alone medical centre.\n\nThe Austin changed its name from the Austin & Repatriation Medical Centre (A&RMC) on 30th April 2003 to Austin Health, but its three facilities - Austin Hospital (Heidelberg), Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital (West Heidelberg) and Royal Talbot Rehabilitation Centre (Kew) first merged in 1995.\n\nThe new Austin Health included the Royal Talbot Rehabilitation Centre and the then psychiatric services at Larundel, which were transferred to the Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital in October 1999. Renal and respiratory services originally provided by Fairfield Hospital were consolidated with Austin Health in June 1996.\n\nThe Victorian State Government redeveloped the Austin Hospital site, opening the new inpatient facility and the newly co-located Mercy Hospital for Women in May 2005. It is the largest hospital redevelopment ever undertaken in Victoria, and one of the largest in Australia. Visit the AR/M Project website for details.\n\nNew mental health facilities were opened on the Austin Hospital site late in 2006, including 55 mental health beds as part of an expanded mental health precinct, with 15 adult acute psychiatry beds (High Dependency Unit), nine beds for the Mood and Eating Disorder Unit and six beds for the Mother and Baby Unit.\n\nThis administrative history was compiled in October 2012 from the agency's website."

Out of this came the recommendation to join individually run hospitals into amalgamated health networks. This also included the establishment of a new hospital at Epping to accommodate the surge in population in the outer suburbs.

Tuberculosis caused one in nine deaths in Victoria in 1902.\n\nAccommodation was origjnally for 35 patients in seven tents, however this slowly expanded.

From 1924, male patients were accommodated at Amhurst Sanatorium (south of Maryborough), which opened in December 1908. At the time of opening, it admitted only female patients.\n\nIn the 50 years following its opening, the need for such a service declined and the Sanatorium grew and progressed in other directions. New drug treatments for tuberculosis made the Sanatorium redundant, and this function of the facility was discontinued in 1956.\n\nThe Greenvale Village for the Aged was inaugurated on 22 August 1955, overlapping with the now renamed Greenvale Sanatorium being officially closed in 1956. The Greenvale Village became known as the Greenvale Geriatric Centre in 1972. A new centre for rehabilitation, Sir William Upjohn House, was opened in 1974.

This is said to be the first dental association in the Australian Colonies (University of Melbourne Archives, 2006). At the first meeting of the Association, held on 26 February 1884, the name was changed to the Ondontological Society of Victoria. The society was directly responsible for placing dentistry on a professional basis and continued until 1920.\n\nThe Society was active in lobbying for legislation for the regulation of the profession in the Colony of Victoria, resulting in the Colonial Parliament passing the Dentists Act 1887 (51 Victoria No. 960). This act provided for the creation of a Dental Board and a Registrar to keep a register of dentists in the Colony. Persons who could prove that they had practised dentistry before the passing of the Act could be registered. Those seeking registration after the passing of the Act were required to have completed a four-year course of study described in the Act and to pass an examination set by the Board. It wasn't until 1910 that a further act was passed preventing unregistered people from practising dentistry.\n\nIn 1890 the Dentists Act 1887 was repealed and the legislation relating to the registration of dentists incorporated into the Medical Act 1890 (No. 1118). The Board operated under the Medical Act (as amended) from this time until the Dentists Act 1972 (No. 8287) was passed.

    "description": "Establishment\n\nThe Victorian Nursing Council was established on 1 March 1958 with the proclamation of the Nurses Act 1956 (No 6035). The Council assumed responsibility for functions previously administered by the Nurses Board (VA 3144). This Act also expanded the new council's function to include the registration of all nurses and the investigation of various matters related to nursing.\n\nFormation and Membership of the Council\n\nThe Act provided for a Council of twenty-eight appointed by the Governor in Council. The Council consisted of twelve registered general nurses (six elected by their peers and six nominated by various nursing institutions), a registered midwife (duly elected by registered midwives), two registered mental or mental deficiency nurses (one elected by registered mental or mental deficiency nurses, the other nominated by the Mental Hygiene Authority), an expert in the field of education, a barrister and solicitor of the Supreme Court and two Ministerial nominees representing mothercraft nurses and nursing aides, with the remaining nominees to come from the medical association and government sector.\n\nFunctions\n\nThe Council was established as a policy-making body, responsible for the regulation of nursing matters. It was responsible for the establishment of standards, the co-ordination of education and the registration of nurses in any branch of nursing. (To be eligible for registration, nurses and midwives were required to undergo training in training schools approved by the Board and to pass the prescribed examinations).\n\nIn performing these functions, the council:\n\n- advised the Minister on all nursing matters.\n\n- co-ordinated policy, research and investigated all matters related to nursing.\n\n- determined the educational standard for entrance into nursing courses.\n\n- administered training programs, setting standards and managing examinations.\n\n- authorised and conducted special courses within the field of nursing, and promoted and established refresher courses for the various categories of nursing.\n\n- consulted and advised authorities and other bodies in matters relating to standards within the field of nursing.\n\n- established links with agents and agencies concerning the use and employment of nurses and from 1960 assumed responsibility for the registration and supervision of these agents and agencies.\n\n- assessed functions for the classification of nurses or nursing services.\n\n- arranged reciprocal recognition of training and qualifications with other nursing organisations within Australia and overseas.\n\n- accepted or rejected applications from hospitals or institutions wanting to establish a training school or course for nurses, inspected training schools revoking approval if facilities or standards were not met.\n\n- registered nurses, issued certificates of registration and annual practicing certificates for all branches of nursing.\n\n- controlled the practice of midwifery by midwives.\n\n- published reports and information concerning nursing matters, circulated information concerning maternal mortality and the preservation of infant life to nurses within these fields.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nFor records of this agency, see list of series below.\n\nBy 1996 the Nurses Board of Victoria (VA 4611) had replaced the Victorian Nursing Council (Nurses Act 1993)."

    "description": "The Vermin and Noxious Weeds Destruction Board was established under the Vermin and Noxious Weeds Act 1958 (No. 6409), its primary function being to advise the Minister of Lands on vermin and noxious weed control within Victoria. A subsequent amendment Act, the Vermin and Noxious Weeds Act 1959 (No 6518), governed the creation and administration of the Board and other related organisations. The Vermin and Noxious Weeds Destruction Board operated from 1959 until it was abolished in 1983. It consisted of three members, who were to be appointed by the Governor-in-Council. These were: a Chairman, who performed the duties of the Superintendent of Vermin and Noxious Weeds, a university graduate who had studied vermin/noxious weed control and destruction, and a person with practical knowledge of agriculture and experience with the destruction of vermin and noxious weeds. These Board members were generally recruited from within the Department of Crown Lands and Survey (538), Division of Inspection.\n\nAs part of the Division of Inspection (later known as The Division of Inspection of Vermin and Noxious Weeds Destruction), the Board oversaw and participated in the Division's functions. These were to investigate, promote, and undertake remedial and preventative measures of vermin and noxious weed control; to conduct scientific research, and to ensure the control or destruction of proclaimed vermin or noxious weeds by instructing land holders and conducting field inspections. The land inspections were carried out by the Inspectors of Land Settlement (later known as Inspector of Lands). The inspectors also instructed and supervised local landholders with vermin and noxious weeds control methods, and performed other duties related to the occupation, sale, and management of Victorian Crown Land. The Keith Turnbull Research Institute conducted research into methods of vermin and noxious weed control. The Extension Officers were primarily responsible for the creation and distribution of promotional material concerning vermin and noxious weeds control management. The Board used the information gathered within the Division to conduct its business.\n\nTo assist the Vermin and Noxious Weeds Destruction Board, the Act also created several other agencies. These were a Central Advisory Council to the Board, and various local District Advisory Committees. The Council comprised the Minister, the members of the Board, and representatives of the Chamber of Agriculture and principal farmers/graziers/dairy organisations within Victoria. The local Committees consisted of the inspector of the locality and others appointed by the Minister on recommendations provided by the Board. It was the function of the Central Advisory Council to advise the Board and Minister on all matters relating to vermin and noxious weeds control and destruction. The functions of the Committees were to confer and cooperate with the Inspectors and local people with regard to appropriate times for destruction campaigns, area specific priorities, the most efficient and effective equipment to be used in specific areas for specific campaigns, the promotion of local interests, coordination of activities, and to cooperate with and report to the Central Advisory Council.\n\nFrom 1977 the Vermin and Noxious Weeds Destruction Board operated as the Department of Crown Lands and Survey Division of Inspection and Vermin and Noxious Weeds Destruction. This was not an administrative change, but a reflection of a decentralisation of departmental functions, which placed a primary focus on the regional committees rather than on the centralised Board.\n\nReorganisation saw the Department of Crown Lands and Survey (VA 538), the Forest Commission (VA 534), and the Ministry for Conservation (VA 551) form a new Department - the Department of Conservation, Forests, and Lands (VA 1034). Formed on 2 November 1983, the new Department's structure and operational arrangements officially came into effect from 1 July 1984. The Vermin and Noxious Weeds Destruction Board was abolished by the Vermin and Noxious Weeds (Re-Organisation) Act 1983 (Act No. 9950). Its policy and planning responsibilities were continued by the Land Protection Service of the new Department, whilst the Regional Management Division took over the Board's operational responsibilities. The re-organisation Act created the Land Protection Council, legislated that the Vermin and Noxious Weeds Destruction Board was to be replaced by the Secretary for Lands, and focused on District and Regional Advisory Committees. Job titles of the Inspectors changed to Land Management Officers, which reflected the new direction in which the Department was heading."

However, it was not until after the passing of a Victorian Act in 1855 that steps were taken for their registration as legally recognised institutions. This Act - An Act to consolidate and amend the Laws relating to friendly societies - received assent on 12 June 1855 and provided for the appointment of a certifying barrister to confirm that the rules of the society were in accordance with the law before the formal registration could be effected by the Registrar. In 1875 a Royal Commission was appointed to inquire into the working of the Friendly Societies Statute, the position and operations of societies registered under it; and to report what amendment, if any, is desirable in the existing law. Effectively, the Friendly Societies Act 1877 provided for the appointment of a fully qualified barrister as registrar in lieu of a registrar and a certifying barrister; for the submission of returns annually to the Government Statist, and for a periodic valuation of the assets and liabilities of the societies at least once in every five years. In accordance with the provisions of the Act, an actuary was appointed under the Government Statist in 1881 to carry out the periodical valuations. In 1907 registration of the societies was made compulsory and in 1911 another Act was passed which required societies to adopt adequate rates whenever called upon to do so by the Government Statist. In accordance with the provisions of the Friendly Societies Act 1928 (No.3686) the Government Statist was to submit to the Minister for presentation to Parliament a report of proceedings of the principal matters transacted in connection with friendly societies and their valuation.\n\nSubsequent amending acts were passed in 1934, 1938, 1946, 1951, 1957, 1958 and 1986.\n\nThe Registry of Friendly Societies (VA 1390) provided administrative support and daily administration of the Acts including the following:\n\nregistration of Friendly Societies Rules and their subsequent amendments\nthe issue of Certificate of Incorporation\napproval of proposed name or change of name\ngranting of licenses to Directors\napproval of auditors and actuaries\ndistribution of surplus on advice of The Actuary\ndetermining the method of approval for proposed merges\nexemption of Dividing Societies and Total Abstinence Societies Advisory Committee\nappointment of investigators or administrators and inspection of documents\nthe submission of an annual Report to the Minister for presentation to Parliament.\n\nUnder the Friendly Societies Act 1958 the Government Statist and Actuary shared responsibility with the Registrar for the general administration of societies.\nIn 1992 the function of the Registrar was taken over by the Victorian Financial Institutions Commission."

    "description": "The Sludge Abatement Board was constituted on 6th of February 1905 by Order-in-Council in accordance with section 60 of the Mines Act (Amendment) 1904 (Act No. 1961). The Sludge Abatement Board was to regulate the disposal of sludge, sand, and debris from alluvial and lode mining in Victoria in order to prevent pollution or damage to watercourses, such as rivers, streams, lakes and reservoirs, and agricultural and grazing lands. This was largely in response to the huge pollution problem caused by a mining industry used to disposing of its waste products through flushing them into local waterways. This problem was exacerbated by the growth and development of settlements in mining districts that used the same drainage systems for their sewerage and excess water disposal, and the alienation of lands down river from mining areas for purposes other than mining, such as for agricultural and grazing lands.\n\nThe Sludge Abatement Board consisted of three members, the first appointments of which reflected the various departments involved with the problems associated with mining sludge - namely, the Lands Department (Surveyor General; JM Reed), the Water Supply Department (Engineer; T Murray), and the Mines Department (Engineer; DB Sellars). JM Reed resigned and was replaced by JM Coane in October of 1905.\n\nDuties of the Board included investigating claims of or the possibility of pollution or damage caused by mining sludge or debris, issuing orders to persons directing operations causing damage or which may cause damage to carry out the directions of the Board regarding their prevention, reporting to the Minister the findings of the Board, making recommendations regarding the application for mining leases in areas affected or likely to be affected by mining debris or sludge, and prosecuting offenders.\n\nReports to the Minister of Mines in 1906 and 1907 revealed the necessity for close supervision and further legislation in order to provide the Board with the power to enforce its recommendations - especially in the mining areas of Bendigo and Ballarat. Local discussions and personal inspections of affected areas revealed a need for more information regarding appropriate Mining practices, drainage facilities, and likely causes of damage to be made publicly available. Long term ongoing depositing of sludge and debris into waterway had entrenched into the minds of mining companies the belief that it was their right to dispose of sludge and mining debris in this manner. New legislation, which incorporated recommendations made by the Board, came into operation on 23rd of December 1907.\n\nThe Mines Act 1907 (Act No. 2127) extended the duties and powers of the Sludge Abatement Board, and specified the various offences and penalties that could be incurred in relation to Sludge Abatement. This Act provided the Board with the legislative power to prosecute those who disobeyed orders of the Board. It also created Sludge Abatement Trusts to oversee sludge abatement in specific areas. Sludge Abatement Trusts had the powers and duties of the Sludge Abatement Board, except that they reported to the Board instead of reporting to the Minister, and could not make recommendations regarding mining lease applications. The first two Sludge Abatement Trusts that were created were to oversee the mining areas of Bendigo and Ballarat. Sludge Abatement Trusts were given the power to make by-laws to regulate matters relating to Sludge Abatement in their district and to obtain revenue by making and levying sludge abatement charges. Once an area was resided over by a Sludge Abatement Trust, it ceased to be within the jurisdiction of the Sludge Abatement Board.\n\nThe Mines Act 1958 (Act No. 6320) consolidated earlier legislation with regard to the regulation and education of the mining industry in relation to sludge abatement. This lessened the need for a Board to oversee the management of Sludge Abatement as it became a smaller problem. The Sludge Abatement Board was abolished in 1983 when its functions were transferred to the Minister by the Mines (Amendment) Act 1983 (Act No. 9936)."

The Land Utilisation Advisory Council's functions were to define catchment areas and advise the Minister and the Soil Conservation Authority on land use in any catchment area. In 1966 the Land Utilisation Advisory Council was charged with recommending the best uses of Crown lands in Victoria. There was no provision for public participation on the Council, however, and as a result of public interest in land-use management and the controversy over the future of the Little Desert, the Land Conservation Act 1970 was passed and the Land Conservation Council established to carry out investigations and make recommendations to the Minister on the balanced use of public land throughout Victoria.\n\nFunctions\n\n conducting investigations and making recommendations to the Minister on the balanced use of public land in Victoria (public land being defined as land which is not within a city, town or borough and which is unalienated land; and includes land permanently or temporarily reserved under the Land Act, State forest, land vested in any public authority other than a municipality or sewerage authority, and land vested in the MMBW)\n\nThe Land Conservation Act 1970 requires that the recommendations made must take into account the present and future needs of the people of Victoria in relation to :\n\n preservation of ecologically significant areas\n conservation of areas of natural interest, beauty, or historical interest\n creation and preservation of areas of reserved forests, areas for leisure and recreation and reserves for fish and wildlife\n preservation of species of native plants\n land required by government departments and public authorities in order to carry out their functions\n\nIn conducting investigations and making recommendations to the Minister on the use of public land, the Council undertakes the following steps:\n\n Publication of notice of the Council's intention to commence an investigation in an area in the Government Gazette and local and state newspapers.\n Preparation of a factual descriptive report by officers of the Council providing a basis for public submissions.\n Invitation to individuals and interested bodies to make written submissions on the balanced use of the public land in question within 60 or 90 days after publication of the report.\n Consideration by Council of the report and all submissions.\n Drafting of set of proposed recommendations.\n Publication of proposed recommendations.\n Consideration of submissions sent in response to publication of draft recommendations followed by final recommendations to the Minister.\n Tabling of final recommendation in both houses of Parliament.\n\nThe Minister may then notify government agencies affected by the recommendations of her/his intention to accept the recommendations. At least 14 days after this notification the Governor-in-Council may direct government bodies to implement those recommendations that affect land for which they have management responsibility.\n\nIn many cases the implementation of public land use recommendations require the formal reservation of land. Delays between adoption of recommendations by Government and their legal implementation can occur, in many cases the land is managed as if it were reserved for the purposes specified in the approved recommendation\n\nThe Council also undertakes other investigations and research into public land use and related issues at the request of the Minister.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nThere are no records of the Land Conservation Council in the custody of the Public Record Office."

    "description": "Establishment\n\nIn the early 1920's the professional association of the Royal Victorian Institute of Architects urged the Government to pass legislation to provide for the registration of architects. The association aspired to formally establish the professional status of architects by regulating standards and architectural practice.\n\nThe Architects Registration Act 1922 (3207), the first legislation passed regulating architects, established the statutory authority of the Architects Registration Board of Victoria. The Board held their first monthly meeting on the 9 April 1923.\n\nFunction and Operation\n\nThe function of the Board was to act as a statutory registration body for the architectural profession. The Board was empowered to issue or cancel certificates of registration, take proceedings for offences against the Act, and prescribe standards for the professional conduct required of practising registered architects. The Board also determined the standards required for registration, by prescribing the course of study including external training, holding the examinations and appointing the examiners.\n\nThe 1922 Act also sought to protect the title of architect, by restricting the use of the term \"registered architect\" to those registered with the Board (with a few exceptions) and providing for penalties for misuse of the title. It was not until the 1939 Act the term was altered to \"architect\" and that all practicing architects were required to register or not use the title.\n\nThe Board consisted originally of seven members appointed by the GovernorinCouncil. Two members were nominated by associated professional organisations, two were nominated representatives of registered architects, and three were nominated by the Minister.\n\nIn 1991 the Board conducted a formal review of the requirement for professional regulation. After representation from the profession itself and interested parties, the Board concluded that architects should continue to be regulated. The focus of the new Act, and therefore the Board, should be in the public interest (inherent in registration and regulation), not in the protection of architects per se. The new Act clarified these principles and provided the Board with a sound legal and procedural base on which to act in the public interest. The Architects Act 1991 was proclaimed, with the new Board holding their first meeting on the 18September.\n\nThis new Board was reconstituted, with consumer interest membership having a significant role in the Board and the Tribunals, with an obligation to investigate and report on complaints imposed, and an appeal mechanism to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal introduced.\n\nThe new Board consisted of eight members, two nominations by the Minister of Consumer Affairs, three nominations made by various professional organisations, two representatives nominated by architects and one government architect nominated by the Minister.\n\nThe Board appoints a registrar and administrative support staff to assist in executing the requirements under the Act and those administrative and operational guidelines stipulated in the Board's regulations.\n\nAdministrative Arrangements\n\nThe Board operates independently of any government agency, maintains its own funding, and reports directly to the Minister who administers the Architects Act. The Minister's defined role includes establishing the composition of the Board's membership and approving the Board's regulations. The Board was required to report to the Minister and the Auditor General on a annual basis. The Act was administered by the following Ministers for the periods indicated:\n\nMinister for Public Works 1922-1987\nMinister for Housing and Construction 1987-1991\nMinister for Planning and Housing 1991-1992\nMinister for Planning 1992-ct\n\nLegislation\n\nArchitects Registration Act 1922 (No.3207)\nArchitects Registration Act 1927 (No.3539)\nArchitects Act 1928 (No.3638)\nArchitects Act 1939 (No.4659)\nArchitects Act (Amendment) 1953 (No.5707)\nStatue Law Revision Act 1955 (No.5896)\nArchitects Act 1958 (No.6201)\nArchitects Act 1991 (No.13/1991)\n\nLocation of Records\n\nMost records of this Agency are still in the custody of the Architects Registration Board.

    "description": "The Neglected and Criminal Children's Act 1864 (No.216) provided for the establishment of industrial schools for neglected children and reformatory schools for convicted juveniles. Superintendents and matrons were to be appointed and provision was made for inspection and reporting.\n\nPrior to 1864 convicted children could, under the Criminal Law (Infants) Act 13 Vic., No.21 1849, be assigned by the Supreme Court to persons willing to undertake their \"maintenance and education\". By 1863 it appears that many children were in the care of the Immigrants Aid Society.\n\nA number of schools had been established under the 1864 Act when on 19 February 1866 George W. Duncan was appointed Inspector of Industrial Schools (a post which seems to have comprehended responsibility for reformatory schools also). Duncan's annual reports beginning in 1867 (Parliamentary Papers 1867, Vol. 4, pp.941ff) describe the functioning of the schools and the establishment and operations of his Office which is first described as a department in the report of 23 June 1876.\n\nDuncan was made Inspector General of Penal Establishments in 1871 and continued to administer both departments until he relinquished the Schools in 1878. The position of Inspector of Industrial and Reformatory Schools was given statutory recognition in the Neglected and Criminal Children Amendment Act 38 Vic.,No.495 1874.\n\nInstitutions\n\nUnder the provisions of the Neglected and Criminal Children's Act 1864, industrial and reformatory schools were established. Children who were deemed to be neglected were to be sent to industrial schools. Children could be deemed neglected if they were found begging, without a home or means of support, residing with thieves, prostitutes or drunkards or declared to be uncontrollable by their parents. Children convicted of any offence could be sent to a reformatory school but justices had the authority to take their age and circumstances into account and to send them instead to an industrial school.\n\nChildren in both classes of institution were to be given access to general education and industrial training, and children as young as eight were expected to work for at least part of the day in activities such as domestic work, cooking, laundering, tailoring, baking, shoe making, dairying, gardening and farming. Boys on the training ship Nelson and the reformatory Sir Harry Smith were to be trained as sailors.\n\nRoyal Commissions and Inspectors General often criticised the adequacy of these arrangements and industrial schools were eventually abolished in the 1880's and replaced by a system of \"boarding out\" of wards to foster homes. In 1879, management of the schools was separated from the position of Inspector (see Report of 1879 et seq.) and placed in the hands of local committees. In addition, two Visiting Committees, of identical composition but charged separately for each class of school, were appointed to inspect and report (see Reports 1880 et seq.). In 1881, management of the department was vested in George Guillaume who was appointed Secretary of the Department on 4 August of that year. A separate position of Inspector continued to be filled.\n\nIn 1887 following the proclamation of the Neglected Children's Act (No.941) and the Juvenile Offenders' Act (No.951) responsibility for neglected children was assumed by a Department for Neglected Children (VA 1467) and a Department for Reformatory Schools (VA 2963) assumed responsibility for convicted juveniles. Although responsibility was statutorily separated in this manner it is evident that both departments continued to be administered jointly within the Chief Secretary's Department (VA 475).\n\nFor further information about the administration of institutions for juvenile offenders see VRG 9 Prisons and Youth Training Centres and VRG 93 Corrections.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nFor records relating to this agency see List of Holdings 2nd edition 1985, sections 3.5.4 (Department of Industrial and Reformatory Schools) and 3.16.5 (Chief Secretary's Office).

    "description": "Establishment\n\nIn 1887 the responsibilities of the Department of Industrial and Reformatory Schools (VA 1466) were statutorily separated with the passing of two Acts.The Neglected Children's Act 1887 (No.941) provided for the establishment of a Department for Neglected Children, while the Juvenile Offenders' Act 1887 (No.951) (subsequently repealed and replaced by sections 314 to 369 of the Crimes Act 1890) provided for the establishment of a Department for Reformatory Schools (VA 2963). Although responsibility was statutorily separated in this manner it is evident that the two departments continued to be administered jointly within the Chief Secretary's Department (VA 475).\n\nFunctions of the Department\n\nThe main responsibility of the Department for Neglected Children was the maintenance and management of neglected children including:\n\n supervision of State wards in receiving houses and probationary schools\n\n provision of trade apprenticeships programs\n\n 'boarding out' of children in the service of persons willing to take charge of their maintenance and education\n\n provision of assistance to non-wards.\n\nUnder provisions of the Infant Life Protection Act 1907 (No.2102) the Department assumed responsibility in 1907 for the registration of homes providing non-parental care to infants from the Office of the Chief Commissioner of Police (VA 724). In addition, under the Children's Maintenance Act 1919, mothers without sufficient means of support could apply to the Department for financial assistance toward the maintenance of their children, rather than have the children committed to the Department's care.\n\nEstablishment of Children's Welfare Department\n\nThe Children's Welfare Act 1924 (No.3351), assented to on 1 October 1924, was enacted to rename the Department for Neglected Children as the Children's Welfare Department. The renaming of the Department signified the Government's awareness of the stigma which had become attached to the term 'neglected child', and did not reflect a change in functional responsibility or status. It is evident that the Department for Reformatory Schools continued to be administered jointly with the Children's Welfare Department.\n\nAdoption, Child Migration and Juvenile Offenders\n\nThe Children's Welfare Department subsequently became responsible for the adoption of State wards when the Adoption Act 1928 (No.3605) introduced adoption as a legal transfer of parental rights, and became responsible for the regulation of the employment of children in street trading under the provisions of the Street Trading Act 1928.\n\nBy delegation from the Commonwealth Minister of Immigration and under the provisions of the Commonwealth Immigration (Guardianship of Children) Act 1946 to 1952, the Director of the Department assumed guardianship of migrants under twenty-one years of age who arrived in Victoria without parents or relatives.\n\nThe Children's Welfare Act 1954 (No.5817) provided for the abolition of the Department for Reformatory Schools (VA 2963). Thereafter, responsibility for juvenile offenders and reformatory schools (from 1954 known as juvenile schools) was assumed by the Children's Welfare Department. At this time the supervision of child employment was extended to cover employment of children in public entertainment and in 1956 family group homes were introduced to provide a new type of child care arrangement.\n\nEstablishment of the Social Welfare Branch\n\nWith the development of Government policy which began to emphasize an integrated approach to social welfare issues and the need for staff training and social research the Social Welfare Branch was established within the Chief Secretary's Department under the provisions of the Social Welfare Act 1960 (No.6651). The Act was proclaimed in stages and the sections concerned with family and child welfare did not become operative until June 1961.\n\nThe Social Welfare Branch (VA 2784) assumed responsibility for all functions previously administered by the Children's Welfare Department and the Penal and Gaols Branch (VA 1464).\n\nFor further information about institutions for juvenile offenders see VRG 9 Prisons and Youth Training Centres.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nFor records of the Children's Welfare Department see the List of Holdings 2nd edition 1985, section 3.5.1.. Researchers are also advised to consult 3.16.5 (Chief Secretary's Office), 3.5.5 (Department of Reformatory Schools) and 13.0.0 (Prisons and Youth Training Centres)."

    "description": "Establishment\n\nThe Western Metropolitan Market Trust (W.M.M.T.) was established in 1938 under the Western Metropolitan Market Act 1938 (No.4623) enacted on 22 December 1938. The Trustees reported directly to the Minister, while the market was managed by a Secretary who employed the market supervisors.\n\nThe municipalities listed below designated members to the Trust and agreed to assume financial and management responsibility for the establishment and operations of the new market. They agreed to operate as a cost-recovery service rather than a profit-making enterprise, and in the event of a financial shortfall, to meet the deficiencies in the following proportions:\n Footscray 35%\n Essendon 33%\n Williamstown 15%\n Braybrook 10%\n Werribee 07%\n\nThe initial funding was sourced from a $60,000 debenture loan and a Victorian Government grant of $24,000, made under the Unemployment Relief Act 1936.\n\nAbolition\n\nIn June 1985 the Governor-in-Council referred 17 statutory agricultural bodies including the W.M.M.T. to the Public Bodies Review Committee (P.B.R.C.) for review. Researchers should refer to the Public Bodies Review Committee (P.B.R.C.) Report on the Western Metropolitan Market Trust, February 1990 for additional information.\n\nThe P.B.R.C. Report concluded that the W.M.M.T. had outlived its statutory usefulness; that it never achieved the goals for which it was originally established; that the bulk of its income was generated from sources not envisaged by the original legislators; that the trading position as a livestock marketing organisation was poor and the utilisation of its assets was inefficient. The Review Committee recommended:\n\n1. that the W.M.M.T. cease to exist;\n\n2. that the future of the Western Metropolitan Pig and Calf Market be decided by the \"contributing Councils\" or their successors;\n\n3. that the assets of the W.M.M.T. should be considered the property of the \"contributing Councils\" and vested in each municipality in proportion to their individual risk exposures.\n\nUnder section 4P(4) of the Parliamentary Committees Act 1968 the municipal councils were required to decide the future of the Brooklyn Market within one year of tabling of the P.B.R.C. Report.\n\nAccording to the Budget Strategy and Review 1991-92, Budget Paper No.2, the State government agreed to the closure of the market, but did not accept the recommendation of P.B.R.C. to the distribution of the assets amongst the municipalities. In February 1991 the Government informed the municipalities of its decision to wind up the Trust and indicated that only 50% of the Trust's assets would be distributed amongst the councils.\n\nHowever shortly before the winding up, the Trustees authorised distribution of the outstanding cash funds amongst the municipalities. The above budget papers should be consulted concerning the Government's response. The remaining assets were disposed of as part of the Government's asset sales program.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nThe 1987 Freedom of Information Statement noted that the Trust maintained a filing system at Brooklyn which contained general correspondence (1938-1987), personnel records, sales records, statistical information and financial records.\n\nThe records in custody were moved to the Department of Agriculture II (VA 3014) from the Brooklyn Pig Market during 1992 and transferred to the Public Record Office in 1993. Given the contents and volume of the records in custody, some records would not seem to be extant, in particular the inward correspondence. Refer to the series registrations listed below for further details."

    "title": "Residential Tenancies Tribunal",
    "description": "The Residential Tenancies Tribunal commenced operation in November 1981 following proclamation of the Residential Tenancies Act, 1980. The Tribunal was established to adjudicate in disputes between landlords and tenants engaged in a tenancy agreement. Under the Residential Tenancies Act either party in a tenancy agreement could, if a dispute arose, apply to the Registrar of the Tribunal for the matter to be heard by the Tribunal and a ruling made. The Act also established laws relating to a range of tenancy matters including procedures for the payment of rent and bonds, rent increases, the entering into and termination of tenancy agreements and the rights and duties of landlords and tenants. These laws provide the basis for all determinations made by the Tribunal.\n\nPrior to 1980 most of the law relating to residential tenancy was embodied in the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1958. Most of the provisions of this Act related to premises known as prescribed (or controlled) premises. These were premises subject to special tenancy conditions, including rent control. The Fair Rents Boards were responsible for rent determination of prescribed premises until 1982 when responsibility was transferred to the Residential Tenancies Tribunal. From that time the Residential Tenancies Tribunal has sat as the Fair Rents Board to determine applications regarding prescribed premises under Part V of the Landlord and Tenant Act and took on the powers and responsibilities of Magistrates Courts relating to the making of orders for the recovery of possession of prescribed premises by landlords.\n\nAlthough applications for the recovery of possession of prescribed premises were still made to and heard by Magistrates Courts, such applications were usually determined by the Residential Tenancies Tribunal. (For a more detailed description of the administration of prescribed premises see VA 2586, Fair Rents Board.)\n\nTwo further jurisdictions have been added to the responsibilities of the Residential Tenancies Tribunal. The Caravan Parks and Moveable Dwellings Act (No.51 of 1988) assigned rights and responsibilities to owners of caravan parks or caravans, on the one hand, and residents who rent caravans or caravan sites on the other. The Residential Tenancies Tribunal determined disputes between owners and residents. The Rooming Houses Act (No.33 of 1990) similarly assigned rights and responsibilities to rooming house owners (and mortgagees) and to residents and the Tribunal similarly determined disputes between owners and residents.\n\nA hearing of the Tribunal could take place anywhere in Victoria, as necessary. Members of the Tribunal are appointed by the Governor-in-Council and had to be (or eligible to be), a barrister and solicitor of the Supreme Court or a stipendiary magistrate. An application to the Tribunal was heard by one member of the Tribunal.\n\nThe Tribunal operated closely with the Ministry of Consumer Affairs and its successors in administering the Residential Tenancies Act, in particular in raising awareness of disputes and in further developing policy and legislation in relation to residential tenancy.\n\nAdministrative support to the Tribunal was provided by the Ministry of Consumer Affairs to 1992 and was since provided by the Department of Justice through its Courts, Tribunals and Registries Division. The Director of Consumer Affairs (later the Director of Fair Trading and Business Affairs) could request that certain applications made to the Tribunal be referred to him or her and the Tribunal may request the Director to investigate certain applications and report back to it. Responsibility for making determinations, however, lay with the Tribunal, which reported upon its operations to the Minister of Consumer Affairs.\n\nEstablishment of VCAT and the abolition of the Residential Tenancies Tribunal\n\nThe Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal was established under the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 1998. It was created as part of a package of reforms to improve the operation of the justice system in Victoria by amalgamating a number of tribunals.\n\nThe Residential Tenancies Tribunal was abolished under section 235 of the Tribunals and Licensing Authorities (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act 1998. VCAT subsequently assumed the jurisdiction that was exercised by the Residential Tenancies Tribunal.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nSee listing below and List of Holdings 1985, section 3.7.4."

    "description": "The Small Claims Tribunal was established in 1974 following proclamation of the Small Claims Tribunal Act 1973. This Act defines a small claim as a dispute between a consumer and a trader over the provision of goods and services or over an insurance contract which involves a claim for reimbursement up to a certain amount. This amount was initially set at $500 under the Small Claims Tribunal Act and Act No.8486 s2(1) has been increased by successive amendments to the Act.\n\nThe Tribunal was established to provide an alternative to court action for minor disputes in the area of consumer law.\n\nA consumer who is involved in a dispute with a trader can apply to have his/her case heard by a Reference of the Tribunal. The Referees are required to:\n\n attempt to bring the parties involved in a dispute to a mutually acceptable settlement\n\n where this is not possible, make an enforceable order with regard to the dispute.\n\nThe Referees are appointed by the Governor-in-Council and report upon their operations to the Minister for Consumer Affairs. Administrative staff are provided by the Ministry of Consumer Affairs. Between 1973 and 1981 the Ministry was a sub-department of the Department of Labour and Industry, however although this agency was ultimately responsible for the provision of administrative support to the Tribunal, the day-to-day operations of the Tribunal were linked to the Ministry of Consumer Affairs rather than the Department of Labour and Industry.\n\nSmall Claims Tribunal Credit Jurisdiction (Credit Division)\n\nUnder the Credit (Administration) Act 1984 (No. 10091) a Small Claims Tribunal was able to be constituted with powers to hear applications under Act 10091 and under the Credit Act 1984 (No.10097). The Credit (Administration) (Amendment) Act 1989 (No. 4/1989) substantially amended Act 10091 to separate the credit jurisdiction from the Small Claims Tribunal and required the establishment of the Credit Tribunal (VA 4047).\n\nSection 83(1) of Act 10091 provided for the appointment of a Credit Registrar of the Credit Division of the Small Claims Tribunal who was to be a duly qualified legal practitioner. Act 4/1989 came into operation on 29 April 1991 on which date separation of the credit jurisdiction from the Small Claims Tribunal was complete and the Credit Tribunal came into being.\n\nPrior to the formal establishment of the Credit Division the Small Claims Tribunals function of hearing disputes between consumers and providers of goods and services allowed it to determine credit related disputes.\n\n\n\n\n\nEstablishment of VCAT and the abolition of the Small Claims Tribunal\n\nThe Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal was established under the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 1998. It was created as part of a package of reforms to improve the operation of the justice system in Victoria by amalgamating a number of tribunals.\n\nThe Small Claims Tribunal was subsequently abolished under section 268 of the Tribunals and Licensing Authorities (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act 1998.

    "description": "The Toora Sewerage Authority was constituted by Order-in-Council dated the 5th of May 1964. This was in response to an application made by South Gippsland Shire Council (VA 2511) under the Sewerage Districts Act 1958 (Act No. 6368) for the proclamation of a Sewerage District and constitution of a Sewerage Authority to carry out works for the sewerage of Toora. Membership of the Toora Sewerage Authority was to consist of all of the Commissioners of the Toora Waterworks Trust for the interim period. The boundary of the Toora Sewerage District was specified by the Order, which set the amount permitted for the Sewerage Authority to borrow at being forty thousand pounds. The principal works of the Toora Sewerage Authority as specified by the application was to consist of reticulation sewers, main sewers, outfall sewer, treatment works, and effluent pipe-line.\n\nUnder the Sewerage Districts Act 1958, any municipality or group of municipalities who would like to have sewerage works constructed, maintained or continued were required to make an application to the Minister, who was to pass it on to the Commission of Public Health (VA 694). Application could also be made by a petition of not less than 200 ratepayers of a particular area, or by a constituted Waterworks Trust.\n\nThe application to the Minister was to include a general plan of works and a description which set forth the object and purpose of the proposed sewerage works, how the funds were to be obtained, an estimate of costs, a statement of the annual value of the property to be benefited by the works, the boundaries of the proposed sewerage district, details of works proposed that would lie outside of this proposed district, and the Waterworks Authority from which water would be obtained for the proposed undertaking and the terms and conditions of supply. The Minister was to forward the general plan and description to the Governor-in-Council for sanction.\n\nNotification of the application for works and the location of where the plan and description have been deposited for viewing by the public were to appear in local newspapers and the Victorian Government Gazette at least a month before the proposed works were to be sanctioned. Petitions by ratepayers in favour of or against the proposed works were to also be forwarded on to the Minister for submission to the Governor-in-Council. Inspection copies of the application, plan and description were to be deposited at the local Municipality Office of each applicant, the office of the Minister, the offices at the Commission of Public Health and/or the offices of the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission (VA 723).\n\nIf the Governor-in-Council approved the submission for works, a Sewerage District could be proclaimed by Order-in-Council. The Sewerage District was to be a body corporate, with perpetual succession, common seal, the ability to borrow money, capable of suing and being sued, and purchasing, holding and alienating land &c.\n\nIf the Sewerage District was within one municipal district the members of the municipal council were to be the members of the Sewerage Authority. If the Sewerage District was shared between several councils, then the members of the Sewerage Authority was to consist of one person appointed by the Governor-in-Council and others elected by the municipal councils concerned, the commissioners of a Waterworks Trust of other body supplying water for the project, or by the councillors of the ridings of the municipal district concerned. The members of the Sewerage Authority were not to number more than six.\n\nSewerage Authorities were required to hold regular meetings and were able to create by-laws and regulations and levy sewerage rates. Sewerage Authorities were to be regularly audited, and were therefore required to keep and maintain accurate accounts. Due to the close relationship between Sewerage Authorities and Water Authorities (such as Waterworks Trusts), office space and recordkeeping systems were often shared.\n\nThe Toora Sewerage Authority became incorporated into the South Gippsland Water Board (VA 2677) from the 1st of July 1984."

The Waterworks Trust was a body corporate, had a common seal, was able to own property and land, was able to be sued and to sue, and take out loans &c. The State Rivers and Water Supply Commission (VA 723) were consulted regarding the constitution of each Waterworks Trust, the approval of loans awarded to Trusts and in other matters relating to Waterworks Trusts. The members of a Waterworks Trust could be the members of a Municipal Council if the Waterworks district concerned was wholly or primarily within one municipal district. Waterworks Trust were to consist of commissioners to be elected at regular periods by the council or councils specified by the Order-in-Council which constituted the Waterworks Trust. No more than three commissioners were to be elected by any one council.\n\nWaterworks Trusts were empowered to make and levy rates upon the owners or occupiers of all lands and tenements within its waterworks district in order to meet its loan repayments, maintain its waterworks effectively, extend its waterworks if this was approved by the Governor-in-Council, and pay expenses incurred in performing the acts required by the various Water Acts of Waterworks Trusts. Rates were to be made annually. Waterworks Trusts were to be audited regularly, and were required to keep and maintain accurate accounts. Annual statements were to be made as soon as possible after the 31st of December for each year. A special meeting for the purpose of settling all accounts was to be held two months after the completion of each audit.\n\nWaterworks Trusts could be dissolved upon receipt of a petition signed by the majority of the ratepayers within the district of a waterworks trust by the Governor-in-Council.\n\nThe Toora Waterworks Trust became incorporated into the South Gippsland Water Board (VA 2677) from the 1st of July 1984."

    "description": "History of Coroners' Courts\n\nThe first coroners were appointed by Superintendent La Trobe in November 1840. Prior to this, the function was handled by the local Police Magistrates, who merely accepted depositions from witnesses to sudden or suspicious deaths. Investigations into the causes of fire only date from 1858 and An Act for preventing the careless use of Fire 21 Vic., No.55.\n\nThe work of coroners was controlled by a mixture of British and Colonial legislation until the Coroners Act 1865 (No.253). This Act and subsequent legislation provided for the Governor-in-Council to appoint as many coroners and deputy coroners as appropriate. All Police (later Stipendiary) Magistrates were appointed as coroners although at times persons such as police officers, doctors and barristers were also eligible for appointment. Coronial work thus came to be based at local Courts of Petty Sessions, with the coroners' activities being confined to the area covered by their jurisdiction. Inquests were usually conducted at the relevant court although, especially in the nineteenth century, they were also held in places such as police stations, lunatic asylums and hotels.\n\nCoronial Function\n\nThe purpose of coronial investigations was to determine factors regarding certain deaths such as:\n\n the identity of the deceased\n the circumstances surrounding the death\n the medical cause of death\n the identity of any persons contributing to the cause of death\n the collection of any other information necessary to register a death.\n\nDespite the regional nature of coronial activity, there was no central co-ordination or regulation of functions. Although it was commonly referred to as the Coroner's Court from about 1952 (having also been previously known as the City Morgue), the Melbourne Coroner's Court merely had jurisdiction for the city and metropolitan area. From 1952 the Melbourne Coroner's Court occupied premises in Flinders Street Extension, Melbourne.\n\nEstablishment of State Coroner's Office 1986\n\nCoronial services were reviewed twice during the 1970's. A Coroners Review Committee, appointed by the Attorney General in 1975, reported in 1977 with recommendations relating to autopsies, laboratory facilities and forensic work. A more comprehensive review was conducted by the Hon. J.G. Norris QC between the period 1978 and 1980. This review recommended a codification of the law on coronial practice which was achieved with the Coroners Act 1985 (No.10257). The Act established the State Coroner's Office (VA 2807) with a state wide jurisdiction for the investigation of a range of defined \"reportable deaths\".\n\nUnder the provisions of the Act, the State Coroner is responsible for the efficient administration and operation of the state's coronial system. Stipendiary magistrates are appointed as coroners by the Governor-in-General and barristers and solicitors may be so appointed. Subject to the direction of the State Coroner, coroners are responsible for the investigation of all reportable deaths as defined by the Act and may initiate an investigation into certain fires.\n\nCoronial investigations may include the conduct of a formal public hearing or inquest and the holding of an inquest is mandatory for certain categories of reportable death including cases where homicide is suspected, where the deceased was held in care immediately prior to his/her death, where the identity of the deceased is not known and at the direction of the Attorney General or State Coroner. Many investigations are now conducted without the holding of an inquest. For further information about the role of the State Coroner and provincial coroners see VA 2807 State Coroner's Office.\n\nRegistration of Inquest Depositions\n\nUnder the provisions of the Justices of the Peace Acts and the Coroners Acts, coroners were required to forward depositions to the Crown Prosecutor. From 1853 and the proclamation of An Act for Registering Births Deaths and Marriages in the Colony of Victoria 16 Vic., No.26, coroners were required to inform the Chief Registrar of the particulars of deaths and the findings of the jury or the opinion of the magistrate as to the cause of death in those cases where an Inquest or Magisterial Enquiry was held.\n\nIn 1856, following correspondence between the Chief Registrar and the Attorney General concerning the obligations of coroners to provide information, the Attorney General advised the Chief Registrar that depositions in cases of inquests would, in future, be forwarded to that office as soon as it had been ascertained that they were no longer required for the administration of justice. (See registry of legal opinions in the custody of the Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages.)\n\nThe practice of forwarding inquest depositions to the Registrar-General continued until 1988 when the State Coroner's Office (VA 2807) assumed responsibility for all coronial records.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nThe Public Record Office has extensive holdings of records relating to the coronial function. Researchers are advised to consult the Inventory of Series entry for the State Coroner's Office (VA 2807) and the List of Holdings 2nd edition 1985, sections 2.4.0 Coroners Court and 3.18.2 Registrar General and Office of Titles."

    "title": "Closer Settlement Board (previously known as  Lands Purchase and Management Board 1905-1918)",
    "description": "The Closer Settlement Board (previously known as the Lands Purchase and Management Board) was responsible for the administration of closer settlement and subsequently soldier settlement from its establishment in 1905 until its dissolution in 1933.\n\nCloser Settlement Prior to the Land Purchase and Management Board\n\nThe Land Act (No.1602) 1898 had made provision for the acquisition of land for the purpose of closers settlement. The Board of Land and Works (VA 744) was authorised to repurchase land and the object of this and subsequent legislation was to transform large estates into closely settled communities engaged in agriculture. The repurchased land was made available as farm allotments, agricultural labourers' allotments and workmen's home allotments to suitable applicants under the terms of conditional purchase leases. Certain residence and improvements conditions applied, initially for the first six years, after which time lessees were at liberty to mortgage, transfer or sub-let with consent and, on payment of the balance of the purchase money, to obtain a Crown Grant. Subsequently lessees were also eligible to apply for advances to assist them to erect dwellings and outbuildings and for other approved purposes.\n\nAlthough statutory responsibility for closer settlement was vested in the Board of Land and Works (VA 744), operational responsibility was exercised by the Closer Settlement Branch of the Department of Crown Lands and Survey (VA 538).\n\nEstablishment of Lands Purchase and Management Board\n\nThe Lands Purchase and Management Board was established in 1905 as a body corporate under the provisions of the Closer Settlement Act 1904 (No.1962). The powers of the Board of Land and Works (VA 744) under part (1V) of the Land Act 1901, were vested in the Lands Purchase and Management Board which was authorised to acquire land for the Crown either compulsorily or by agreement. The Board was authorised to dispose of land previously acquired and, with the approval of the Governor-in-Council, to dispose of any unalienated and unoccupied Crown land including any swamp or reclaimed Crown land. The Board allocated land to applicants under conditional purchase leases which required lessees to fence the land, to destroy vermin and noxious weeds and to make other improvements. The leases were granted subject to residence requirements and lessees of agricultural labourers' allotments and workmen's home allotments were required to erect a dwelling within one year.\n\nThe Act authorised the Board to make advances to lessees to assist them to fence their land and to build the required dwellings and, at the request of the lessee, the Board could erect the required dwelling. The Board was also empowered to set aside land for townships and reserves; to make improvements to the land prior to sale and to sell land as sites for churches, public halls, schools, cemeteries, butter factories and creameries, quarries and recreation reserves.\n\nRelationship of Board to Department of Crown Lands and Survey (VA 538)\n\nPrior to 1905, the officers of the Closer Settlement Branch of the Department of Crown Lands and Survey had been responsible to the Secretary for Lands but following the establishment of the Lands Purchase and Management Board, the officers were to have been responsible to the Board whose Secretary was appointed by the Governor-in-Council, subject to the provisions of the Public Service Act. However the officers of the Board remained subject to the Department of Crown Lands and Survey (VA 538) in relation to promotions and matters of general discipline and their salaries were paid from the Department's salary vote.\n\nIn 1913, following concern expressed by the Minister and the Secretary of the Department of Crown Lands and Survey that the Closer Settlement Branch was not working effectively, it was agreed that a large part of the work of the Branch should be amalgamated with similar land settlement work being undertaken within the Department and divided control of the function was thus established. Administrative difficulties continued however and the chairman of the Board argued before the Royal Commission on Closer Settlement (1914) that these inefficiencies arose from there being dual control of the officers, whereby most were responsible to the Secretary for Lands and only ten or eleven were wholly responsible to the Secretary to the Board. The Royal Commission however was very critical of the Board's failure to organize its office properly and reported that \".....the Board does not appear to have taken charge of the Officers at all. Throughout, the Department has controlled the Board.\" The role of the Department in the administration of closers settlement continued to be significant until 1938 when complete responsibility was assumed by it.\n\nTransfer of Responsibilities to the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission (VA 723)\n\nIn 1913, under the provisions of the Closer Settlement Act 1912 (No.2438) certain powers of the Lands Purchase and Management Board were transferred to the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission (VA 723) which was authorised to acquire and dispose of lands for closer settlement purposes. This transfer of authority applied only to land which was considered suitable for closer settlement under irrigation conditions and which was situated or likely to be situated within an Irrigation and Water Supply District within the meaning of the Water Act 1905. However the leases were to be issued by the Governor-in-Council; the Commission was not to grant advances to lessees after the expiration of six years and after that period authority reverted to the Board. These restrictions were subsequently repealed by legislation. (Closer Settlement Act 1918 (No.2987)).\n\nSoldier Settlement\n\nIn 1917 under the provisions of the Discharged Soldiers' Settlement Act (No.2916), the Board became responsible for the settlement of discharged soldiers on lands set aside exclusively for them. The Act also authorised the Board to make special provisions for the settlement of discharged soldiers.\n\nEstablishment of Closer Settlement Board\n\nUnder the provisions of the Closer Settlement Act 1918, (No.2987) the Closer Settlement Board assumed the powers and responsibilities of the Lands Purchase and Management Board. Although the Act made changes to requirements concerning acquisition of land, valuation of land, the granting of advances, the conditions under which leases were issued and the administration of the Closer Settlement Fund, the responsibilities of the Closer Settlement Board were essentially the same as those of its predecessor.\n\nSettlement of Assisted Immigrants\n\nUnder the provisions of the Empire Settlement Act 1922, approved British immigrants, particularly those wishing to settle permanently on the land, were encouraged to migrate to Australia. Subject to the Commonwealth and State Agreement of 21 September 1922, (see schedule to British Migrants Agreement Act 1933, No.4143) the Board assumed responsibility for the settlement of immigrants on the land. Under the Agreement the State was responsible for providing farms and for receiving immigrants on arrival. The State agreed to offer them employment in country areas or to allot them land, if there was evidence of their having sufficient knowledge and previous experience; to provide supervisors to assist the settlers and to provide advances for the purchase of equipment and stock and for improvements including housing.\n\nReview of Closer Settlement Schemes\n\nIn the mid 1920's the closer settlement programmes, particulary the soldier settlers schemes became the subject of a number of inquiries including a Royal Commission in 1925 and Boards of Inquiry in 1926 and 1927. In 1927 the Commonwealth Government appointed Mr Justice Pike to inquire into soldier settlement in all States. (See VPRS 7921 Report and Working Papers, Royal Commission on Soldier Settlement).\n\nThese inquiries subsequently led to the abolition of the Board and the establishment of the Closer Settlement Commission. (VA 2268)\n\nAbolition of Closer Settlement Board\n\nIn 1933, under the provisions of the Closer Settlement Act 1932 (No.4091) the Closer Settlement Board was dissolved and the Closer Settlement Commission (VA 2268) was established. The Commission assumed responsibility for all functions previously administered by the Closer Settlement Board and for the closer settlement responsibilities of the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission (VA 723).\n\nLocation of Records\n\nThere are significant holdings of records concerning the administration of closer settlement in the custody of the Public Record Office.\n\nSee List of Holdings 2nd edition 1985, section 3.6.2 (Department of Crown Lands and Survey); 3.6.21 (Closer Settlement authorities) and 3.23.2 (State Rivers and Water Supply Commission)."

    "title": "Farmers' Relief Board",
    "description": "The Farmers Relief Board was established under the provisions of Part II of the Unemployed Occupiers and Farmers Relief Act 1931 (No. 3962) as part of a scheme to assist debt-ridden farmers during the Depression. Under Section 23 the Board was to consist of three members appointed by the Governor in Council, including one nominee from the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce and one farmer nominated by the Chamber of Agriculture. The Governor in Council was to appoint one member as Chairman. The Board reported to the Minister for Lands.\n\nThe initial Act was amended extensively over the next four years, including three amending Acts in 1931 and 1932 (Nos. 3971, 4019, 4025) and the Farmers Relief Acts of 1932 (No. 4060) and 1933 (No. 4201).\n\nUnder Section 21 farmers were able to apply for a Protection Certificate which protected them from adverse action to recover debt. Initially applications were made to the Court of Petty Sessions held near the farm concerned. However, the Farmers Relief Act 1932 (No. 4060) changed the jurisdiction from the courts to the Board. The Court or Board could issue a Protection Certificate if satisfied that debt proceedings were impending and that it was in the interests of the farmer and his creditors to issue the certificate [S. 21(4)].\n\nUnder Section 27 and 28, the Board could appoint a committee to act in an advisory capacity to the Board and to the farmer. The farmer was to comply with the advice of the committee and the Board, could not dispose of property without the consent of the Board, and was to send to the committee monthly statements of sales of produce. The Board was to deal with the property of the farmer for the benefit of the farmer and his creditors. Under Section 32 the Board controlled the income of the farmer, ensuring that the income was used first to pay a living allowance to the farmer, then to purchase supplies, then to make payments towards debts.\n\nIn response to the continuing rural and financial crisis there were further discussions on the best way to assist the rural sector. George Brown, the secretary of the Farmers Relief Board, presented a report to the Minister for Lands dated 23 April 1933, on Farmers Relief and similar legislation in other states and in New Zealand. Mr Brown reported that the Farmers Relief Acts were operating smoothly, but recommended that consideration be given to increasing the use of the provisions for 'amicable arrangement' between the farmer and his creditors, and also to whether there should be funds provided for farmers advances. From 5 to 23 May 1933 the Premier hosted a Rural Rehabilitation Conference, during which nine plans were presented by individuals and interest groups.\n\nAs a result of these public discussions the Farmers Relief Act 1933 (No. 4201) was developed, extending the date of operation of the Farmers Relief Acts and increasing the provision for schemes of reduction of debt. Under Section 30 of the initial Act, the Board could negotiate to bring about amicable arrangements between farmers and creditors, including the reduction or extinguishment of debts. Amendments in the 1933 Act developed this further so that farmers could apply to the Board for reduction of debts. Schemes for reduction of debts or interest had to take into account industry conditions and the interests of all parties, and could be made binding by the Board. A further clause required that the Board must be satisfied that the farmer was working the land to its full capacity and had reasonable prospects of becoming able to carry on farming operations without loss [S. 21(4)]. Under Section 27 the Board had the power to make recommendations to the Closer Settlement Commission (VA 2268) to make advances to farmers under Protection Certificates.\n\nIn 1935 the Commonwealth Government allocated 10 million to the States for the purpose of adjusting debts of farmers who were in financial difficulty as a result of adverse seasonal and economic conditions (see Annual Report of the Rural Finance Corporation 1951). The Farmers Debts Adjustment Act 1935 (No. 4326) was developed to manage plans of debt adjustment using Commonwealth funds. The Act abolished the Farmers Relief Board and replaced it with the Farmers' Debts Adjustment Board, VA 2269. The new Board continued to administer the Farmers Relief Acts and had new responsibilities under the new Act."

    "description": "Closer Settlement Prior to the Closer Settlement Commission\n\nThe acquisition of land for the purpose of closer settlement had first been authorised under the provisions of the Land Act 1898 (No.1602). The object of this and subsequent legislation had been to transform large estates into closely settled communities engaged in agriculture. The repurchased land was then made available as farm allotments, agricultural labourers' allotments and workmen's home allotments under the terms of conditional purchase leases.\n\nLater legislation authorised the compulsory acquisition of land, the disposal of any unalienated and unoccupied Crown land including any swamp or reclaimed Crown land, the acquisition of land held under lease from the Crown, the setting aside of land for townships and reserves and the sale of sites for churches, schools, cemeteries, public halls, recreation reserves and other purposes.\n\nLessees were eligible to apply for advances to assist them to meet the improvement requirements of their leases including the erection of dwellings and outbuildings, fencing and the control of vermin and noxious weeds.\n\nCloser settlement was initially the responsibility of the Department of Crown Lands and Survey (VA 538) a sub department of the Board of Land and Works (VA 744). In 1905 responsibility was transferred to the Lands Purchase and Management Board which was succeeded by the Closer Settlement Board (VA 2266) in 1918. Under the provisions of the Discharged Soldiers Settlement Act (No.2916) the Board also became responsible for the administration of soldier settlement from 1917 and from 1922, under the provisions of the Empire Settlement Act 1922 and the subsequent Commonwealth and State Agreement, the Board was responsible for the settlement of British immigrants on the land. For further information about the administration of these functions see VA 2266, Closer Settlement Board (previously known as the Lands Purchase and Management Board).\n\nEstablishment of the Closer Settlement Commission\n\nThe Closer Settlement Commission was established in 1933 under the provisions of the Closer Settlement Act 1932 (No.4091). Its establishment represented a consolidation of the administration of closer settlement and soldier settlement. The Act transferred to the Commission powers and obligations previously vested in the Closer Settlement Board (VA 2266) and the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission (VA 723) which had become responsible for the administration of closer settlement on irrigable lands from 1913 under the provisions of the Closer Settlement Act 1912 (No.2438).\n\nThe Closer Settlement Commission was appointed by the Governor-in-Council and consisted of five members who were to include a chairperson, one person previously a member of the Closer Settlement Board, one person previously a member of the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission or an officer of that Commission who had been responsible for closer settlement and two persons having a knowledge of finance and primary production.\n\nPowers of the Closer Settlement Commission\n\nThe Commission, with the approval of the Minister, could make use of the services of any of the officers and employees of the Department of Crown Lands and Survey (VA 538); staff previously employed under the Closer Settlement Acts were deemed to have been appointed to temporary office in the Department and officers of the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission (VA 723) who had previously been engaged in the administration of closer settlement were transferred to the Public Service as officers of the Department of Crown Lands and Survey (VA 538).\n\nIn addition to powers concerning the acquisition and disposal of land the Act conferred on the Commission certain powers that had previously been the prerogative of the Minister or the Governor-in-Council. The Commission was also made responsible for the administration of the Land Act in so far as it related to lessees or licensees who had received advances under the Closer Settlement Acts and for the administration of the Seed Advances Acts, the Fallowing Advances Acts, the Cultivation Advances Act and part 1 of the Wire Netting Act 1928, these powers having been previously exercised by the Minister, the Board of Land and Works (VA 744) or the Closer Settlement Board (VA 2266).\n\nThe Act removed restrictions on the transfer of leases and provided for the consolidation of debts arising from the issue of leases and the authorization of advances. The Commission was authorised to reassess the value of the land, to make annual adjustments of liabilities and in doing so to take into account the prices of farm products, seasonal conditions and the personal circumstances of the licensee or lessee.\n\nAbolition of the Closer Settlement Commission.\n\nIn 1938, under the provisions of the Closer Settlement Act (No.4596), the Closer Settlement Commission was abolished. The Board of Land and Works (VA 744) was deemed its successor in law and statutory responsibility for the administration of the Closer Settlement Acts, Fallowing Advances Acts, Cultivation Advances Acts, part 1 of the Wire Netting Act 1928 and the Farmers Advances Acts was vested in the Board.\n\nThe Closer Settlement Act 1938 was to be administered by the Department of Crown Lands and Survey (VA 538). No provision was made for the further acquisition of land; the Closer Settlement, Discharged Soldiers' Settlement and Discharged Soldiers' Concession Funds were abolished and the funds were transferred to consolidated revenue. The Board of Land and Works (VA 744) was authorised to dispose of land under closer settlement leases, subject to the payment of a deposit of not less than ten percent of the lease or by auction or public tender. If the land could not be sold by auction or tender, the Board was authorised to dispose of it by sale.\n\nThe Act also provided for the issue of new leases to existing settlers and made provision for the adjustment and repayment of existing liabilities. The new closer settlement leases were to be registered with the Registrar of Titles (VA 862) and all encumbrances including registered mortgages in respect of advances made or charges arising from the Advances to Settlers Act 1923, Wire Netting Act 1928, Vermin and Noxious Weeds Act 1928, Land Tax Acts and the Unemployment Relief Loan and Application Acts were to be endorsed on the leases. The Act also established conditions for the transfer, surrender and forfeiture of leases and for the issue of Crown Grants.\n\nThe Department of Crown Lands and Survey (VA 538) continued to be responsible for the administration of Closer Settlement until the repeal of all legislation relating to closer settlement and authorisation of advances to farmers in 1982 under the provisions of the Closer Settlement (Winding-up) Act (No.9798).\n\nLocation of Records\n\nThere are significant holdings of records concerning the administration of closer settlement in the custody of the PRO.\n\nSee List of Holdings 2nd edition 1985, sections 3.6.2.

    "title": "Farmers' Debts Adjustment Board",
    "description": "The Farmers' Debts Adjustment Board was constituted under Section 2(1) of the Farmers Debts Adjustment Act 1935 (No. 4326). The Board was to consist of three members appointed by the Governor in Council with the chairman being a person experienced in legal and business matters. One other member was to have practical farming experience and the other was to have commercial experience. The Act was proclaimed on 24 December 1935 and the first Board was appointed on that day (see Government Gazette 8 January 1936, p. 57). It appears that the Board reported to the Treasurer, as the Board appears under the Treasury Votes in the Annual Finance Statements.\n\nThe Farmers' Debts Adjustment Board was the successor to the Farmers Relief Board (VA 2267). With the passing of the Rural Finance Corporation Act 1949 (No. 5414), the Farmers' Debts Adjustment Board was dissolved on 26 April 1950 and succeeded by the Rural Finance Corporation (VA 2272).\n\nThe Farmers' Debts Adjustment Board was responsible for the administration of the Farmers Relief Acts. This included Part II of the Unemployed Occupiers and Farmers Relief Act 1931 (No. 3962), subsequent Farmers Relief legislation, and the Farmers Debts Adjustment Act 1935. See VA 2267 for a description of the earlier Farmers Relief Acts. The Board was later also responsible for the administration of the Farmers Protection Act 1940 (No. 4737) and the Farmers Protection Act 1941 (No. 4877).\n\nIn 1935 the Commonwealth allocated 10 million to the States for the purpose of adjusting debts of farmers who were in financial difficulty as a result of adverse seasonal and economic conditions. The Farmers Debts Adjustment Act was developed to manage plans of debt adjustment using the 2.3 million of Commonwealth funds allocated to Victoria.\n\nThe Farmers Debts Adjustment Act did not repeal all of the provisions of the previous Farmers Relief Acts. However farmers applying for protection under the Farmers Debts Adjustment Act were ineligible to apply for protection under the earlier Acts. Any existing Protection Certificates were cancelled when a farmer was issued a Stay Order under the 1935 Act. It is not clear whether farmers continued to apply for protection under the earlier Farmers Relief Acts once the Farmers Debts Adjustment Act was proclaimed.\n\nUnder Section 12 of the Farmers Debts Adjustment Act, farmers were able to apply for an adjustment of debts to a local Conciliation Officer.These officers were under the control and direction of the Board, and were charged with the local administration of the Act. On receipt of an application, the officer issued a Stay Order that protected the farmer from any action, execution or proceeding in respect of any debt of the farmer. The Conciliation Officer was responsible for working with the farmer and the farmer's creditors to develop a plan of debt adjustment, taking into account the farmer's prospects and the interests of all parties concerned. The Conciliation Officer submitted the plan to the Board for confirmation or refusal.Stay Orders stayed in place until cancelled by the Board.\n\nIt appears that once a plan of debt adjustment was approved, the Board took responsibility for managing the case. Throughout the period of the stay order or plan, the farmer was required to supply to the Board information on receipts and expenditure, and was required to seek the Board's approval in the disposal of assets including property. A plan of debt adjustment could include the cancellation of Crown debt, or the Board consolidating the farmer's debts and paying creditors. Any monies paid by the Board on the farmer's behalf were repayable by the farmer over a lengthy term and could be secured by a mortgage on the farmer's property.\n\nUnder Section 43, the Board was able to recommend to the Closer Settlement Commission (VA 2268) that advances be made to enable a farmer to continue farming operations. Subsequent Farmers Advances acts made reference to Section 43, so that the Board was able to recommend payments under those acts (eg. Drought Relief Act 1940 (No. 4782)).\n\nAll applications under the Farmers Debts Adjustment Act had to be submitted by 24 December 1937, although later legislative amendments extended the application date to 30 June 1944. As there were no current provisions for debt protection for farmers in 1940, the Farmers Protection Act 1940 (No. 4737) was introduced. It was repealed a year later by the Farmers Protection Act 1941 (No. 4877). Both Farmers Protection Acts included provisions for the development of plans of debt adjustment, and for debt protection through the issuing of protection or stay orders. Both Acts generally applied to debts incurred prior to the commencement of the 1940 Act on 9 September 1940. The Board was responsible for managing all cases under both Farmers Protection Acts. Farmers applied directly to the Board for protection or stay orders.\n\nUnder the Farmers Protection Act 1940 creditors were required to give farmers 21 days notice of their intention to take action to recover any debt. On receipt of such a notice, the farmer could apply to the Board for a Temporary Protection Order. During the period the order was in force, the Board was to negotiate with the farmer and the creditor to secure an adjustment of debt. If negotiation failed, the Board was able to issue a Conditional Protection Order, taking into account any benefits available to the farmer under the Farmers Relief Acts.\n\nThe Farmers Protection Act 1941 tightened the process whereby farmers could apply for protection. Farmers could apply for a Limited Stay Order in relation to debts incurred before or after 9 September 1940. In certain circumstances the Board could issue a General Stay Order in relation to other debts. Once an order was issued, the Board was to continue to seek an agreement between the farmer and the creditor in relation to adjustment of the debt. The Board was able to control the income of the farmer during the operation of any order. Under the 1941 Act farmers could apply for protection until 1 March 1943. Later amendments extended the application date to 1 March 1948 and the expiry date for all stay orders to 1 March 1949."

    "description": "The Soldier Settlement Commission (SSC) was established under the Soldier Settlement Act 1945 (No. 5107) and began operating in February 1946.\n\nThe powers and functions of the Commission included the following:\n\n- To inspect and report on land deemed to be potentially suitable for soldier settlement\n\n- To recommend the setting apart or acquisition of land for soldier settlement\n\n- To view all books and accounts relating to land and its operations, where this information would assist in determining the suitability of land\n\n- To acquire land either by agreement or compulsorily for the purposes of the Act\n\nThe Soldier Settlement Amendment Act 1946 (No. 5133) went through Parliament in May 1946, making it easier for people with sufficient capital to buy their own farms. In December 1946, Parliament passed the Soldier Settlement Act 1946 (No. 5179) which, among other things, authorised the Soldier Settlement Commission to advance money to former members of the forces for single unit farms. The last single unit farm applications were accepted in 1959 when World War II settlement in Victoria was nearing its end.\n\nThe SSC purchased more than half of the freehold acreage it would eventually acquire for War Service Land Settlement (WSLS) subdivision in the first 3 years of its establishment. Victoria's land price controls were lifted in late 1949 and land costs increased by 60%. Throughout the 1950s, (except for an enforced halt for some months in 1952 due to loan fund cutbacks) the SSC steadily bought established properties from private owners however the annual acreages purchased were lower than those of earlier years and the prices higher. In 1961 the SSC purchased its last major estate, the Gooramgong property outside Euroa, owned by the Sargood family.\n\nThe last group settlement was on the 24 block Warrowie estate near Colac, which was formally advertised in the Government Gazette on 30 November 1960. Ivan Roy Fitzgerald was recorded as the last name in that group. It wasn't until 1969-70 that the last settler obtained his Purchase Lease.\n\nLand Settlement\n\nBy the beginning of 1951 the SSC commissioners had decided to think seriously about developing three major areas of Crown land - Heytesbury, Yanakie and Nyora. A conference was held on 8 February 1951 to discuss the feasibility of settlement in these areas and the Minister of Lands expressed interest in settlement opportunities for others as well as ex-servicemen.\n\nIn December 1953, the Land Settlement Act (No. 5768) was passed opening up settlement opportunities for young civilian men without previous war service. The main provisions of the Soldier Settlement Act for acquiring and setting apart land were to apply to the Land Settlement Act, although settlers could choose whether to finance their own farm development or accept assistance from the SSC. The enterprise was an initiative of the Victorian Government and funded and administered through the SSC. However, the SSC's primary task was still to be soldier settlement and until this tapered off no large scale operations under the Land Settlement Act were visualised.\n\nThorough preparation of undeveloped Crown land for settlement took some time. Major operations didn't begin at Heytesbury until 1956, by which time Victoria's World War II Soldier Settlement program was starting to wind down. The last of Nyora's 15 blocks were allocated to soldier settlers in that year.\n\nBy the time Victoria's soldier settlement scheme ended in 1961 (the final loan request had been processed by July that year), two major Crown land areas had been developed solely for soldier settlers - at Robinvale and Nyora. Civilian and soldier settlement schemes operated side by side at Yanakie, the first eight civilian settlers having been allocated blocks during that year. Yanakie's second-stage development under the Land Settlement Act was eventually completed by 1965."

    "description": "The Rural Finance Corporation was constituted under Section 5 of the Rural Finance Corporation Act 1949 (No.5414), and was the legal successor to the Farmers' Debts Adjustment Board (VA 2269). The Corporation was deemed to be a legally constituted body corporate from the date of the first meeting [S12(2)], which was to be held on 12 April 1950. The Corporation was to report annually to the Treasurer, and copies of the reports were to be presented to Parliament.\n\nUnder Section 7 the Corporation was to consist of three members appointed by the Governor in Council, with one member having knowledge and experience in business finance and another having knowledge of and experience in primary production and rural industries. The objects of the Corporation were set out in Section 6 and include the encouragement of country development and improvement of country industries. The Corporation was able to do this through low-interest loans to persons or groups engaged in country industry.\n\nThe Corporation was able to raise money by application to the Public Account, by the issuing of debentures or inscribed stock, or from interest charged on loans and other fees and charges. Under Section 42 the Corporation was authorised to make loans to persons or bodies carrying on primary industry or other rural pursuits, secondary industry in non-metropolitan areas, or the co-operative marketing or manufacture of rural products.\n\nThe Corporation took on some of the debt adjustment functions of the Board. From 26 April 1950 all existing Stay Orders under the Farmers Debts Adjustment Act 1935 (see VPRS 10192) were cancelled, and there were to be no further orders issued nor plans of debt adjustment confirmed under that Act. Under Section 51 of the Rural Finance Corporation Act a farmer could apply for assistance in discharging debts. This was to be achieved through a composition or scheme of arrangement between the farmer and creditors, which could include the Corporation advancing monies to the farmer. To support the development of schemes of arrangement, a Rural Rehabilitation Fund was established. Into the fund were to be paid all monies remaining in the Farmers' Debts Adjustment Fund, and all monies received by the Corporation as repayment of loans.\n\nThe Rural Finance Corporation was dissolved on 17 March 1962 under the Rural Finance and Settlement Commission Act 1961 (No.5414). Under that Act the functions of the Corporation were combined with those of the Soldier Settlement Commission (VA 2270) to form the Rural Finance and Settlement Commission (VA 2273)."

    "description": "The Rural Finance and Settlement Commission was established in 1962 and assumed the powers and functions of the former Soldier Settlement Commission (VA 2270) and the Rural Finance Corporation (VA 2272). To achieve this, two distinct branches were created - the Settlement Branch and the Finance Branch.\n\nThe former Crown land area of Heytesbury became the Rural Finance and Settlement Commission's major project for civilian land settlement. The first section of the Heytesbury settlement was officially opened in late 1959, by which time it was no longer part of the Soldier Settlement Scheme, having been formally transferred for civilian settlement under the Land Settlement Act. There were 88,000 acres that had been formally transferred for civilian settlement by the end of 1961, some of which had been originally developed and funded originally through the Commonwealth's Special Advance for Soldier Settlement. During the 1960s two other settlements, at Rochester and in the East Goulburn Irrigation Area, were developed by the Rural Finance and Settlement Commission under the Land Settlement Act.\n\nIn 1977 the Rural Finance and Settlement Commission became the Rural Finance Commission (VA 1073), with continued responsibility for the administration of soldier settlement legislation."

The initial proposal to constitute a Committee named the Evacuation of Industries Committee to investigate these matters was made in February 1942. Under the chairmanship of Hon J H Lienhop, M.L.C. and with representatives from both Commonwealth and State departments and instrumentalities, its function was to give effect to resolutions of the Premiers Conference regarding the Evacuation of Industry. It would seem that this Committee became the precursor of later Committees concerned with investigating and encouraging decentralisation of industry."

    "title": "Court of Insolvency, Melbourne",
    "description": "Historical background\n\nA separate administration developed for dealing with insolvency matters in Port Phillip District following the appointment of a Chief Commissioner of Insolvent Estates in February 1842. Commissioners for Insolvent Estates were appointed for Portland in the 1840s, Geelong in 1855 and Beechworth in 1866.\n\nIn the English legal system a distinction was made between bankruptcy and insolvency. Bankruptcy law had related only to traders or those engaged in commercial activities while insolvents were non-traders who could not pay their debts. The titles of early insolvency act (refer to 5 Vict. No.17, December 1841 and 7 Vict. No.19, December 1843) indicate that the legislation was effected as a means of giving relief to insolvent persons and subsequently imprisonment for debt was abolished. The Supreme Court was given jurisdiction over both residents and persons carrying on business in the Colony. The system differed from the English practice, for it combined, in one insolvency jurisdiction, the two branches of law, insolvency and bankruptcy.\n\nThe Commissioners of Insolvent Estates who administered the provisions of insolvency acts appear to have been administrative officers of the Supreme Court of New South Wales for the District of Port Phillip (VA 914, 1842 to 1852) and of the Supreme Court of Victoria (VA 2549, 1852 to 1871).\n\nFrom 1852 to 1859 the master in Equity (VA 2624) also held the position of the Chief Commissioner of Insolvent Estates. In 1859 the two offices were separated.\n\nCourt of Insolvency, Melbourne VA 2304\n\nIn 1871 under the provisions of the Insolvency Statute (No.379) the offices of Chief Commissioner and Commissioners of Insolvent Estates were abolished and these officials were deemed at the commencement of this Act to have become judges of the Court of Insolvency.\n\nA Court of record called the Court of Insolvency was established in and for Victoria. The Court of Insolvency was a Court of law and equity and was to have a seal to seal all records, documents, proceedings and copies. The court was to have all the powers, rights and privileges of the Supreme Court of Victoria.\n\nThe Court was to have original jurisdiction and control in all matters of insolvency and to hear and determine any matter relating to the disposition of insolvent estates or of property taken under sequestration and claimed by the assignees or trustees for the benefit of the creditors.\n\nAll judges of County Courts in Victoria, except the judge of the County Court at Melbourne were also to be judges of the Court of Insolvency. The Melbourne Court of Insolvency was presided over by a judge of the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Governor-in-Council was empowered to establish Insolvency Districts for Victoria and appoint places and times for the court to sit in each District. The Clerks of Insolvency Districts were required to send a copy of the Order of Sequestration to the Chief Clerk at the Court of Insolvency at Melbourne.\n\nAppeals against an order of the court of insolvency could be made to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe clerks of the District Courts of Insolvency and the Chief Clerk of the Court of Insolvency at Melbourne were required to send a copy of the Order of Sequestration to the Registrar-General to be registered and details of Orders of Sequestration were published in the Government Gazette.\n\nThe officers of the Court of Insolvency including the Chief Clerk were officers of the Crown Law Department. The Chief Clerk reported to the Secretary of the Law Department.\n\nApparently, from 1900, the Registrar of the County Court also held the position of Chief Clerk in Insolvency.\n\nTransfer of Function to Commonwealth\n\nA Bankruptcy Act, passed by the Commonwealth Parliament in October 1924 and amended in 1927, was brought into operation on 1 August 1928. It superseded the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Acts of the States. A Federal Court of Bankruptcy was established and directly exercised its jurisdiction in Victoria from 1928.\n\nFunction\n\nThe jurisdiction in insolvency encompassed the legal proceedings governing the distribution of the property of insolvent persons among their creditors and the relief of insolvents from responsibility for the unpaid balance of their liabilities.\n\nProcedure\n\nA person was considered insolvent when he/she was unable to meet his/her debts in full. A debtor could petition to be declared insolvent by the court and as such to be discharged of all debts. In the case of compulsory sequestration, (confiscation) a persons creditors would petition the court for an order. The court would determine whether an Order of Sequestration should be granted. An Order of Sequestration gave temporary control of an insolvent persons property to an official assignee or trustees. The Insolvency Statute 1870 provided for dealing with insolvent estates not merely by the insolvency machinery but also by arrangement and liquidation. If no composition or scheme of arrangement was approved, he/she was ajudged an insolvent and his/her property was vested in a Trustee to determine how the property should be distributed among the creditors.\n\nCourt Records\n\nFor insolvency records from the Melbourne and metropolitan area see inventory of series below.\n\nRecords of local insolvency courts were attributed to grouping of courts by geographic location, e.g., for Geelong see Geelong Courts, and so on. Even though the clerks of the District Courts of Insolvency were required to send a copy of the Order of Sequestration to the Chief Clerk at Melbourne, these orders were not incorporated into the Register of Insolvencies VPRS 757 created by the Court of Insolvency at Melbourne.\n\nRegistrar-General's Records\n\nResearchers are also advised to consult the registers and indexes which were created by the Office of the Registrar-General and Office of Titles to register copies of Orders and adjudications of Sequestration forwarded to the Registrar-General under the provisions of successive Insolvency Acts. See Inventory of Series for VA 862."

This was in accordance with the provisions of the Water Act 1958 (Act No. 6413) in order to set up a Waterworks Trust to carry out works for the supply of water to the Township of Dumbalk. The Order specified that the Commissioners of the Trust were to be five people elected by the ratepayers and one other person. It also specified that the amount of the loan granted to undertake the works was to be nineteen thousand pounds. The principal work to be undertaken by the Trust was to be construction and maintenance of a pumping station, rising main, elevated storage, reticulation and service meters in the Township of Dumbalk.\n\nUnder the Water Acts, any municipality or group of municipal councils who desired to have waterworks contrasted, maintained or continued in or for their municipal districts were to send to the Minister an application for submission to the Governor-in-Council details including a general plan and description of the works for his sanction. Notification of the plan and suggested works were to be published in newspapers and the Government Gazette for at least a month, and proof of this notification was to be supplied to the Minister. If a petition against or for the construction of the works was also created, they were to also be forwarded to the Minister for submission to the Governor-in-Council.\n\nUpon approval of the waterworks constructions, the Governor-in-Council caused a Waterworks Trust to be constituted in order to construct and maintain the works. The Waterworks Trust was a body corporate, had a common seal, was able to own property and land, was able to be sued and to sue, and take out loans e.t.c. The State Rivers and Water Supply Commission (VA 723) were consulted regarding the constitution of each Waterworks Trust, the approval of loans awarded to Trusts and in other matters relating to Waterworks Trusts. The members of a Waterworks Trust could be the members of a Municipal Council if the Waterworks district concerned was wholly or primarily within one municipal district. Waterworks Trust were to consist of commissioners to be elected at regular periods by the council or councils specified by the Order-in-Council which constituted the Waterworks Trust. No more than three commissioners were to be elected by any one council.\n\nWaterworks Trusts were empowered to make and levy rates upon the owners or occupiers of all lands and tenements within its waterworks district in order to meet its loan repayments, maintain its waterworks effectively, extend its waterworks if this was approved by the Governor-in-Council, and pay expenses incurred in performing the acts required by the various Water Acts of Waterworks Trusts. Rates were to be made annually. Waterworks Trusts were to be audited regularly, and were required to keep and maintain accurate accounts. Annual statements were to be made as soon as possible after the 31st of December for each year. A special meeting for the purpose of settling all accounts was to be held two months after the completion of each audit.\n\nWaterworks Trusts could be dissolved upon receipt of a petition signed by the majority of the ratepayers within the district of a waterworks trust by the Governor-in-Council.\n\nThe Dumbalk Waterworks Trust became incorporated into the Tarwin Valley Water Board (VA 2258) from the 1st of July 1984."

The role of the National Film Board was, to expand, promote, assist and coordinate the production, distribution and importation of films for school and adult education, social development, international understanding, trade and tourist expansion and immigration. The various State Governments were invited to form State Advisory Committees to assist the Board in its duties in making or acquiring suitable films and to act as distributing agencies.\n\nIn July 1945, the acting Executive Officer of the National Film Board asked the State Committees, in addition to encourage the expanded use of documentary films, teaching films and other visual aids, and the establishment and development of films and visual aids within their states.\n\nThe State Advisory Committee set up in Victoria held its inaugural meeting on 18 December 1945 . On 22 February 1946, the Committee decided that a central organisation was needed in Victoria to distribute educational and documentary films. The Committee submitted a report to the State Government, proposing the establishment of the State Film Centre, whose functions would be: the maintenance of a film library, information and booking service, and the provision of centralised film production facilities for State Government Departments.\n\nIn June 1946 the Government accepted the Committee's recommendation and the State Film Centre was established in December 1946. The Victorian Documentary Film Council (formed in 1946 or 1948) advised the Government of Victoria on all matters relating to documentary film and supervised the functions of the State Film Centre.\n\nThe State Film Centre purchased its first film in January 1947 and commenced the Library in April 1947.\n\nFinance was determined by the State Government and every two months the Victorian Documentary Film Council met at the State Film Centre to determine policy matters, supervise the general activity of the film library and discuss the reports and correspondence submitted to it. There was close collaboration between the Centre and the Film Division of the National Library of Australia, in Canberra, for which the Centre acted as the Victorian distribution centre.\n\nThe governing structure of the State Film Centre changed in 1983. The State Film Centre of Victoria Council Act 1983 (No. 9943) established the State Film Centre of Victoria Council as governing Council to the Centre. The Council was set up as a body coporate and was successor to the Victorian Documentary Film Council. The State Film Centre was given for the first time since establishment, a legislative base from which to operate. The Act defined the functions and objectives of the State Film Centre and articulated the Centre's intent to increase the appreciation of and promote public interest in film as a medium for providing education, information, knowledge and entertainment. The State Film Centre became known as the State Film Centre of Victoria\n\nFunction\nThe State Film Centre functions, while the Victorian Documentary Film Council was the advisory body, were:\n\n- to collect and maintain a list of all suitable documentary and educational films\n\n- to assist and promote the more extensive exhibition of these films in schools and approved public bodies\n\n- to place prospective users of films in contact with the source of supply of suitable films\n\n- to acquire copies of suitable films\n\n- to recommend to the National Film Board the production of films of national interest\n\n- to maintain a record of all National Film Board production, and\n\n- to coordinate where possible the production and utilisation of films in matters of mutual interest to State Departments.\n\nThe functions of the State Film Centre of Victoria Council were:\n\n- to operate and develop the State Film Centre\n\n- to preserve, develop and maintain a library of documentary films\n\n- to develop and maintain a library of periodicals, books and other materials relating to or for use in connection with documentary films\n\n- to provide a documentary film information service\n\n- to provide a technical advisory service to assist documentary film users\n\n- to distribute and exhibit or arrange for the distribution or exhibition of documentary films\n\n- to conduct research for the purpose of improving the quality and effectiveness of documentary films\n\n- to advise the Minister in respect of the development of policies dealing with the production, acquisition, exhibition and distribution of documentary films\n\n- to investigate, report and make recommendations to the Minister in respect of any matter relating to documentary films referred to the Council by the Minister\n\n- to perform such other functions appropriate to the State Film Centre as the Minister may direct\n\nLocation of Records\n\n Some records are presumed to have been transferred to the National Film and Sound Archive in Canberra."

    "title": "Department of Water Resources",
    "description": "The Establishment: Background\n\nThe Department of Water Resources was established under the Water (Central Management Restructuring) Act 1984 as the central management agency for the State's water resources. Its establishment followed a review of Victoria's non-metropolitan water industry by the Public Bodies Review Committee in 1980-1982 (see 2 April 1980 reference from Parliament in Victoria Government Gazette of 20 May 1981, No.42, p.1595, and the Committee's Reports to Parliament, Nos. 1-8, in particular Eighth Report, Future Structures for Water Management, Vol 3, Final Report: The Central and Regional Management of the Water Industry). The objective of the review was to recommend structures and procedures that would enable more efficient, effective and economic utilisation of water resources. It addressed in particular the geographical and functional fragmentation of the water industry and the need to develop an integrated system of water management.\n\nTraditionally water resource management in Victoria had been divided between authorities responsible for the Melbourne and Metropolitan area on the one hand and rural Victoria on the other. The 1975 Act establishing a Ministry of Water Resources and Water Supply (abolished by the 1984 Act) represented an attempt to set up a central coordinating body, but the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission (VA 723) and the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works (VA 1007) continued to operate much as before with no changes in their powers, responsibilities or functions. With the establishment of the Department of Water Resources, for the first time there was a central management agency with statewide responsibilities for policy development, planning and coordination for the water industry.\n\nDate of Establishment\n\nThe Department came into being on 1 July 1984 (Governor-in-Council Order of 19 June 1984 amending Schedule Two of the Public Service Act 1974 - Victoria Government Gazette No.67, 20 June 1984, p.2025).\n\nObjectives\n\nThe Department's principle responsibility is concerned with the provision of advice to the Minister on matters relevant to the Water Portfolio and its statutory functions enable it to play a central policy, planning and coordinating role. The Water (Central Management Restructuring) Act 1984 set down the major objective of the Department as provision of policy advice to the Minister to ensure:\n\n that the water resources of the State are managed in ways which are most beneficial to the people of Victoria\n that water services are provided to local communities to the extent and to standards appropriate to the needs of those communities\n that there is secured in the water sector a working environment which is safe and satisfying\n that the management of water resources and the provision of water services are undertaken in a socially and environmentally responsible manner and in consultation with the appropriate authorities.\n\nDirector-General of Water Resources\n\nThe Act also establishes the Director-General of Water Resources as a corporate body. The first Director-General was Dr. John Paterson.\n\nFunctions\n\nThe functions of the Department as specified in an Order-in-Council of 26 June 1984 (Victoria Government Gazette No.69, 27 June 1984, p.2127) are:\n\n To provide advice to the Minister on - the management, development and use of the water resource of the State; and the provision of water services to the people of Victoria;\n\n To review and develop policy options, plans and programs for the water sector in consultation with operating agencies where appropriate, to co-ordinate policy development within the industry, and to advise the Minister on industry plans, programs and institutional arrangements;\n To ensure the development of a comprehensive data base for the Victorian water sector relating to water resources and water-related matters, and financial, physical, and manpower resources, and to analyse and monitor the data base in the development of policies, plans and programs;\n To develop guidelines and planning parameters, to assist operating agencies in the water industry to develop plans and programs and to provide advice to agencies;\n To analyse financial programs and budgets prepared by various operating agencies in the water industry, to identify associated policy issues and to provide advice to the Minister on all aspects of such programs and budgets prior to their consideration and approval by Government;\n To monitor and review the performance of operating agencies against approved budgets, programs and objectives, and to assist the Minister in evaluating and reporting on industry performance;\n To provide management and technical support and to disseminate information to the various bodies in the water industry;\n To develop public education programs to promote community awareness of the need for more efficient and effective management of the State's water resources; and\n To undertake water services and related functions as may be assigned by legislation, directed by the Minister or delegated to the Department by other public authorities.\n\nAbolition of Department\n\nIn April 1990 all the functions and responsibilities of the Department were transferred to the newly established Department of Conservation and Environment (VA 3004).\n\nLocation of Records\n\nNo records have been transferred to the Public Record Office."

Some restructuring of the industry had already occurred in the previous year, when the Geelong Waterworks and Sewerage Trust accepted responsibility in July 1983 to supply water to the area previously suplied by the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission. This area included the Bellarine Peninsula and along the coast to Anglesea.\n\nIn order to ensure a smooth transition of responsibility, each merging authority ceased operation on the last day of its financial year and was amalgamated by the Board on the following day.\nThe Geelong Waterworks and Sewerage Trust ceased to exist on 30 June 1984 and its responsibilities were transferred to the Board on July 1, 1984.\nOn 1 October 1984, Anglesea, Barwon Heads, Torquay and Queenscliff Sewerage Authorities merged with the Board. The Winchelsea Waterworks Trust and the Winchelsea Sewerage Authority merged with the Board on 1 January 1985. The Bellarine Sewerage Authority closed its books on 30 September 1985 and amalgamated with the Board on 1 October 1985.\n\nFrom 1995, water and sewerage for this region has been under the control of the Barwon Region Water Authority."

Caulfield became a City by Proclamation dated 26 July 1913.\n\nCaulfield largely retained its original borders as defined at the time of its creation as a district in 1857. The only significant alterations to the municipality's boundaries were by severance of part of the Shire of Caulfield to the City of StKilda in 1896 and part of the City of Caulfield to Oakleigh Borough in 1913.\n\nAs at 1871 Caulfield was divided into four ridings: SouthWest, NorthWest, Eastern and EastStKilda ridings. From 1901/02 the municipality was divided into four wards: East, North, South and West wards. The Municipality most recently underwent re-subdivision in 1977 and retained the names of the four wards previously existing.\n\nLocal Government Reform 1993-1995\n\nThis council was abolished in 1994 as part of a statewide program of local government reform enacted between 1993 and 1995.

The City of Glen Eira (VA 3687) has been appointed as the successor in law for Caulfield City Council and has assumed all rights, assets and liabilities of this abolished council.\n\n\n\nFile Note\n\nThe above registration was based largely on the entry for the City of Caulfield in the 1988 Municipal Directory. Most dates have been confirmed by reference to Victorian Government Directories. The exception is the 1896 annexation to St Kilda.

    "title": "Langi Kal-Kal Youth Training Centre (previously Male Reformatory Prison 1950 to 1965)",
    "description": "The Aboriginal name, Langi Kal Kal, means resting place for the singing cicada. In 1838 the property was a 70,000-acre property with a substantial farmhouse built around 1900. The property was officially named in 1940. After World War 2, the land was subdivided and the central area, including the farmhouse, was set aside for prison purposes. Specifically, in 1948 the Penal Department bought the homestead and 5,000 acres for a Training Centre at a cost of 63,000 pounds. Chief Secretary Galvin said:\n\n'The sheep station at Langi Kal Kal is to be transformed into a model school for vocation, academic and cultural training of youths committed there. There is no thought of turning the farm into a profit making venture.'\n\nNomination of Langi Kal Kal as a Penal Purpose Reserve occurred on 17 May 1950. The institution known as the Langi Kal Kal Training Centre was established as a reformatory prison for male persons under the provisions of the Crimes Act 1928 as to indeterminate sentences by Order of the Governor in Council under section 523 of that Act. The Order was published in the Government Gazette of 31 May 1950. By regulation under the Children's Court Act 1928, published in the Government Gazette of 4 April 1951, the institution was prescribed as a place to which children could be committed by a Children's Court under section 28 (1) (g) of the Act. By virtue of these provisions, Langi Kal Kal was available for the detention of two classes of male prisoner:\n\n- Those apparently of the age of seventeen years or upwards who, upon conviction for an offence, were directed by a Judge of the Supreme Court or a Chairman of the Court of General Sessions, pursuant to either section 515 or section 516 of the Crimes Act, to be detained during the Governor's pleasure in a reformatory prison; and\n\n- Those above the age of fifteen years and under the age of seventeen years against whom certain indictable offences had been found by a Children's Court to be proved and who had been ordered by the Court to be committed to Langi Kal Kal either for a fixed term of not more than twelve months or for such a fixed term together with a direction that, on the expiration of the term, they should be further detained there during the Governor's pleasure.\n\nThe first prisoners arrived in September 1950 from Castlemaine, and the prison was officially opened on 22 February 1951. At the official opening, the Chief Secretary Mr Dodgshun stated that 'I want this to be regarded as a youth training centre, and not a prison'.\n\nLocated on a 1080 hectare property near Ballarat, the facility housed offenders between the ages of 17 and 21 who had received sentences in the adult courts, but whose offences and age were thought insufficiently serious to warrant detainment at an adult prison such as Pentridge. Offences fell largely into the category of crimes against property - burglaries, theft of motor vehicles, shop lifting and so on. In addition, Langi Kal Kal provided for the detention of the younger second class of prisoner described above.\n\nThe Penal Reform Act 1956 abolished the system of indeterminate sentences and the machinery necessary for the administration of that system. Such places as were set apart as reformatory prisons ceased to be reformatory prisons and became gaols within the meaning of the Gaols Act 1928. All sentences of imprisonment (including those of Children's Courts) were to be for specified terms. Under the new legislation, Langi Kal Kal would become a gaol.\n\nLangi Kal Kal housed between 50 and 120 offenders at any one time over its 40 plus years history. They were variously trained in educational programs focussing on literacy, oracy, and numeracy extension courses, a trades section, community projects, and farming projects involving agricultural and farming produce. In its operation as a general purpose farm on its 2700 acre property, Langi Kal Kal supplied farm products to other Departmental institutions.\n\nYouths were placed into different sections depending upon their age, whether they were Wards, the nature and seriousness of the offence(s) they committed, and whether they had a history of absconding. Although this basic structure was sustained throughout the life of the institution, the centre changed to reflect shifting thought on reform of youth offenders, beginning with the transfer of Langi Kal Kal from the Prisons Department to the Youth Welfare Division of the Social Welfare Branch, Chief Secretary's Department, in 1965. Langi Kal Kal changed from being a prison to become a youth training centre.\n\nRehabilitation enjoyed its greatest educational support in the 1950s, aiming to teach new skills and behaviours, particularly basic numeracy, literacy and work skills. Such programs were seen to be appropriate preparation for jobs at the lower end of the work market. The first teacher was appointed in 1958 (School No. 4758). By the 1970s, moves were underfoot to replace rehabilitation with reintegration, which sought to equip youth offenders for the move into the community. According to a promotional brochure published by the Department of Community Services, the training program at Langi Kal Kal aims to promote the types of attitudes and relationships which will help trainees to mature and to develop socially while at the same time giving them a sense of personal achievement. Trainees could earn a set amount of money each week, some of which could be spent on canteen. The rest of the money was kept until the trainee was discharged.\n\nBy 1991 there was concern expressed from within and beyond the Department that Youth Training Centre facilities fell well below international standards. The Department of Community Services' 1991 Annual Report concluded that while access of young offenders to mainstream services for education, self-development and accommodation are being improved, pressing demands for capital investments remain. As youth supervision and attendance orders were issued increasingly in preference to custodial sentences, Langi Kal Kal was prepared for closure in March 1993.\n\nThe Department of Community Services announced the closure of Langi Kal Kal in December 1992. When the Langi Kal Kal Youth Training Centre was closed in March 1993, Malmsbury became Victoria's main Youth Training Centre for 17 to 20 year old offenders. There were about 40 trainees at the Centre when its closure was announced and they were progressively released on parole or remissions. Approximately 5500 trainees passed through the Centre during its history.\n\nLangi Kal Kal became an adult prison in June 1993."

    "title": "Supreme Court of Victoria",
    "description": "Establishment and Constitution\n\nPrior to separation and the establishment of the Supreme Court of Victoria in 1852, the highest court for the Port Phillip District was the Supreme Court of New South Wales for the District of Port Phillip (VA 914). Prior to 1841, the highest local courts had been the Courts of Quarter Sessions which had first been proclaimed on 14 August 1838 and consequently criminal cases and civil litigation of any importance had been heard in New South Wales. In 1841 a Resident Judge of the New South Wales Supreme Court for the Port Phillip District was appointed. In 1852, following separation from New South Wales, the Legislative Council passed an Act (15 Vic.,No.10) to establish the Supreme Court of Victoria.\n\nThe Supreme Court is the highest court of the State, having jurisdiction over all civil and criminal matters, which have not been excluded by statute. The 1975 Constitution Act (No.8750) provides for the Supreme Court to consist of two divisions, the Court of Appeal and the Trial Division. All judges are appointed by the Governor on the advice of the Executive Council, from practitioners of not less than eight years standing, and retire by the age of seventy or seventy-two years, depending on when appointed. At present the Supreme Court is comprised of a Chief Justice and a President of the Court of Appeal, and nine Judges of Appeal and twenty Puisne Judges.\n\nThe Full Court and from June 1995, the Court of Appeal,(usually three, but sometimes five, judges) hears and determines appeals arising from cases heard by single Judges of the Supreme Court and from the County Court in both civil matters and criminal cases and, with leave, the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal. There is no general right of appeal in civil matters from a decision of a Magistrates' Court, however a dissatisfied party may apply to have a Supreme Court Judge review a case in law. The main activities of the Supreme Court are centred in Melbourne and Judges go \"on circuit\" to Ballarat, Bendigo, Geelong, Hamilton, Horsham, Mildura, Sale, Shepparton, Wangaratta and Warrnambool.\n\nFunctions of the Court\n\nCurrently the Supreme Court deals with cases such as murder, manslaughter and other criminal matters, civil actions involving large claims and appeals against decisions of the lower courts. Historically the Supreme Court dealt with matters such as equity, lunacy, divorce and insolvency. Jurisdiction in some of these matters passed to the Commonwealth at or since federation in 1901, for example divorce in 1976, though the State Courts continued to be vested with federal jurisdiction in some cases. Federal laws regarding divorce and marriage had been passed in 1959 and 1961 respectively and these laws superseded state law. Under the provisions of the Family Law Act 1975, operational from 5 January 1976, a Family Court of Australia was established to administer Family Law including considerations for the dissolution of marriage. Appeals against the decisions of the Supreme Court may be heard in the High Court of Australia. Prior to the passing of the Australia Acts in 1986, appeals could also be heard by the Privy Council, although in recent decades such appeals became increasingly rare.\n\nOfficers of the Supreme Court\n\nVarious officers of the Supreme Court exercise or have exercised judicial and/or administrative responsibility.\n\nFrom 1842, prime responsibility for the administration of insolvency proceedings was exercised by the Chief Commissioner, and Commissioners of Insolvent Estates. In 1871, under the provisions of the Insolvency Statute 1871 (No.379), jurisdiction in insolvency matters passed to the Court of Insolvency, Melbourne (VA 2304) and to various district Courts of Insolvency. The offices of the Chief Commissioner and Commissioners of Insolvent Estates (for country areas) were abolished. These officials were deemed at the commencement of the Act to have become judges of the Court of Insolvency.\n\nThe Master in Equity (also known as the Master in Equity and Lunacy 1867-1923) (VA 2624) was responsible for the administration of matters dealt with under the provisions of the Law of Equity as opposed to those of Common Law and enacted law. The Master in Equity assisted the Supreme Court; provided legal opinions on matters referred by the Court; undertook enquiries and investigations as ordered by the Court; managed financial matters relating to the court, including payments made by trustees or executors and arranged the payment of costs in equity proceedings, conveyancing and other business of the Court.\n\nUnder the provisions of the Lunacy Act 1867 (No.309) and subsequent legislation, the Master in Equity as Master in Lunacy was responsible for the supervision and administration of the estates of persons found to be lunatic by inquisition (their estates being managed by individuals known as \"committees\" who were appointed by the Court following an inquiry by the Master in Equity); patients admitted to public mental hospitals or mental homes and persons of unsound mind who were incapable of managing their own affairs. It was the Master's role to act for persons declared to be lunatics or inebriates before a Judge of the Supreme Court.\n\nIn 1940, under the provisions of the Public Trustee Act 1939 (No.4654) responsibility for the administration of estates of patients in mental hospitals and persons incapable of managing their own affairs was assumed by the Public Trustee (VA 719) who also assumed responsibility for functions previously administered by the Curator of Estates of Deceased Persons.\n\nThe Master in Equity was also responsible for the granting of probate in cases where it was considered that probate would be granted by the Supreme Court and for the administration of the estates of deceased persons where the administration of the estate was not contested.\n\nUnder the provisions of the Master of the Supreme Court Act 1948 (No.5329) the Master of the Supreme Court (VA 2613) became responsible for those functions previously administered by the Master in Equity (VA 2624) and the Chief Clerk of the Supreme Court, including the granting of probate and administration of the estates of deceased persons where the administration was not contested; the investigation of matters as directed by a Judge of the Supreme Court and the supervision of \"committees\" appointed by the Court to administer the estates of \"lunatics\". Since 1986, the Master of the Supreme Court has been known as the Senior Master and is responsible for the supervision of other officers of the Supreme Court.\n\nIn 1960, the Master of the Supreme Court ceased to have responsibility for probate and administration. The Registrar of Probates (VA 2620) who had previously received direction from the Master of the Supreme Court, assumed statutory responsibility for the granting of probate in those cases where it is considered that probate would be granted by the Supreme Court and for the administration of the estates of deceased persons where such grants are uncontested. Contested estates are determined by the Court.\n\nThe Prothonotary of the Supreme Court, now also known as the Principal Registrar, oversees the administrative aspects of actions and appeals coming within the jurisdiction of the Court. Among other things, the Prothonotary is responsible for the issuing of writs and other processes that initiate civil proceedings in the Supreme Court. The Prothonotary is also responsible for the filing of documents and for the custody of Supreme Court records.\n\nThe Sheriff administers the Juries Act and is responsible for the enforcement and execution of Supreme Court Writs and Orders and the control and direction of civil warrants issued from Magistrates' Courts and executed by civilian bailiffs. The Sheriff is also responsible for the security of the Supreme Court, its judges and all persons attending the Court. Under the provisions of An Act to make provision for the better control and disposal of Offenders 16 Vic.,32.(1853) certain public gaols, prisons, houses of correction etc. were to be under the charge, care and direction of the Sheriff of the Colony of Victoria. The Sheriff retained responsibility for the supervision of certain prisons until 1871 when, following a Royal Commission on Penal and Prison Discipline, the Statue of Gaols 1864 (No.219) was amended and the Inspector of Penal Establishments became responsible for the supervision of all prisons (see the Statute of Gaols Amendment Act 1871 (No.397)).\n\nNOTE: Far more extensive research into the history of the Supreme Court of Victoria, its officers and administration is required but has not been possible for this edition of the Summary Guide. Researchers requiring further information may find it helpful to consult the Report of the Civil Justice Committee 1984 and in particular, Appendix I, Background Paper on the Administration of the Supreme Court.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nFor records of the Supreme Court and its officers see also the entries in the Summary Guide for Master in Equity, Supreme Court (VA 2624), Master of the Supreme Court (VA 2613) and Registrar of Probates (VA 2620). See also the following sections of the List of Holdings, 1985 edition, 1994 reprint: 2.2.0 (Supreme Court of Victoria); 2.2.1 (Master in Equity, Supreme Court of Victoria); 2.2.2 (Prothonotary of the Supreme Court); 2.2.3 (Registrar of Probates, Supreme Court of Victoria); 2.2.4 (Sheriff of the Supreme Court) and 3.4.10 (Master in Equity)."

Upon its establishment in 1983, the Office under the control of the Director of Public Prosecutions assumed full and independent authority for the preparation, institution and conduct of criminal proceedings on behalf of the Crown in the Victorian Supreme Court and County Courts and where relevant, the High Court of Australia. The Director of Public Prosecutions is able to conduct prosecutions for summary offences in the Magistrates' Courts and to assist a Coroner in an inquest. Although the Director of Public Prosecutions has almost exclusive jurisdiction in the area of criminal proceedings, the Attorney-General retains the residual power to grant a \"nolle prosequi\" (an application to discontinue further proceedings in a prosecution). Where commencement of criminal proceedings requires the consent of a law officer, the Director is now the appropriate law officer for this purpose.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nFor records of criminal proceedings in Victoria see also List of Holdings 2nd edition 1985, section 3.4.2 (Criminal Law Branch, Crown Solicitors Office)."

    "description": "The Victorian Sheriff's Office was created in 1852 following separation from the Port Phillip District. James Simpson was appointed Acting Sheriff until Claud Farie was appointed in 1852, serving as sheriff until 1870.\n\nKevin Morgan's 'History of the Sheriff's Office of Victoria', due to be published in early 2005 reports that, by the end of June 1854, Claud Farie had appointed 13 Deputy Sheriffs to oversee seven 'stations': Geelong, Sandhurst (Bendigo), Castlemaine, Beechworth, Heathcote, Bunninyong and Kyneton. Deputy Sheriff salaries were based on the size of their jurisdiction.\n\nAccording to Kevin Morgan's research, the Administration of Justice Act 1856 allowed for the title of \"Deputy Sheriff' to be replaced by that of 'Sheriff'. However it was not until the 1860s that the title of 'Sheriff' finally superceded that of 'Deputy Sheriff' in the jurisdiction of regional bailiwicks. Morgan also states that the Sheriff of Victoria continued to give the title 'Deputy Sheriff' to his most senior assistant in the Melbourne office and the title has continued to the present day.\n\nThe Sheriff of the Supreme Court is responsible for the enforcement and execution of Supreme Court Writs and Orders and the control and direction of civil warrants.\n\nDue to an increasing number of criminal warrants managed by the Sheriff's Office from 1989 to 1994 the Enforcement Management Unit was created in 1994 to manage administrative and operational arrangements of the Sheriff's Office. By the time Victoria's seventeenth sheriff, Peter Duncan retired in 1995 reports Morgan, 'the Victorian Sheriff's Office had acquired responsibility for all court orders, fines, enforcement warrants and civil warrants in Victoria. It had become the first Sheriff's Office in Australia to be developed in this way and its management approach represented a significant innovation in modern law under the Westminister System.'\n\nFrom 1993 the administration of juries, previously the Sheriff's responsibiity, became a separate branch of operations managed by the Deputy Sheriff Juries."

    "description": "The Legislative Assembly resolved that the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission (VA 723) and each constituted water, sewerage, drainage and river improvement authority (except the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works) be referred to the Public Bodies Review Committee for Review in April 1980. This resulted in the recommendation by the Public Bodies Review Committee that the various water and sewerage authorities be abolished and a new structure set up. This re-structuring was legislated by the Water and Sewerage Authorities (Restructuring) Act 1983 (Act No. 9895). The objectives of this Act were the following:\n- to create interim administrative arrangements designed to facilitate the effective and efficient operation of the urban water industry in Victoria.\n- to make that industry more structurally coherent and to reduce its geographical and functional fragmentation,\n- to reduce the total number of bodies responsible for the supply of water and sewerage services,\n- to define the role of the Minister in the development of new structures and procedures in the urban water industry, and\n- to promote the more efficient, economic and effective allocation and utilization of the State's water resources.\n\nAs a result of this Act, new water and sewerage authorities referred to as Water Boards were created by Order-in-Council and the details of their constitution were published in the Government Gazette.\n\nUnder this Act, the Wonthaggi-Inverloch Water Board was constituted by an Order-in-Council dated 26 June 1984. Inverloch Waterworks Trust (VA 2105), Wonthaggi Sewerage Authority (VA 2048), and Inverloch Sewerage Authority (VA 1991) were abolished. The Wonthaggi Waterworks and Wonthaggi Urban Districts were transferred from the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission to the Wonthaggi-Inverloch Water Board. The geographical areas, functions, land, liabilities, obligations, powers, property, rights and employees of these various authorities became the responsibility of the new Water Board.\n\nThe Order-in-Council was enforced from the 1st of July 1984, and continued until a further program of structural reform took place under the Water Act 1989 (Act No. 80/1989). Under this Act, the South Gippsland Region Water Authority was constituted by Order-in-Council to take effect from the 1st of January 1995.\nThis Order stated that the South Gippsland Region Water Authority was responsible for the staff, liabilities, obligations, land, property and functions of the Wonthaggi-Inverloch Water Board from that date."

By 1857 the property qualifications had been abolished and male adult suffrage was granted for the Legislative Assembly. Adult suffrage for women was not granted until 1908, and women were not eligible to stand as candidates for election until 1923. Voting was made compulsory for the Legislative Assembly elections in 1926.\n\nIn 1858 membership of the Assembly was increased to seventy-eight and extended again in 1876 to eighty-six members, with a corresponding increase in the number of electoral districts. By 1888 membership had risen to ninety-five with Legislative Assembly electoral districts numbering eighty-four. This upward trend was reversed in 1903 with a reduction in membership to sixty-eight. Two members were appointed as representatives of the Railway Department and another was to represent public servants. However this departmental representation lasted only until 1906 when the membership was further reduced to sixty-five - one member for each of the sixty-five electoral districts. By 1976 membership had risen to eighty-one and by 1987 it was eighty-eight.\n\nProcedures\n\nThe duration of each Parliament is determined by the life of the Legislative Assembly (limited to three years) but it may be dissolved by the Governor on the advice of the Premier before the expiration of that period. The Legislative Council (VA 471) cannot be dissolved except in special circumstances arising from disagreement between the two Houses.\n\nProcedure of the Assembly is governed by Standing Orders, Rules and practice, based initially on the procedures of the House of Commons, and administered by the presiding officers: the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly and the Chairman of Committees. The principal innovations in Assembly procedure are time limits on speeches and the elaborate ballot procedure at the opening of a new Parliament for the election of the Speaker.\n\nThe sittings of the House commence with the reading of the Lord's Prayer by the presiding officer.

This Act provided for a landlord or tenant to apply to a Court of Petty Sessions for the fair rent of the premises to be determined.3\n\nLegislation enacted in the 1940's, however, controlled the level of rent of all rented premises, not just those in respect of which an application was made to a court.4 Under Commonwealth National Security (Landlord and Tenant Regulations) the level of rent of all rented premises was frozen on 31 December 1940 and the role of a Commonwealth Rent Controller was established to determine appropriate variations to rent.\n\nThis procedure was embodied in Victorian Legislation in 19485 and later that year the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act transferred the responsibilities of the Rent Controller to the Fair Rents Boards.6 Under this Act, the Governor-in-Council could constitute a Board in any place in Victoria that was deemed to be appropriate. Each Board consisted of one stipendiary magistrate.\n\nUnder the Landlord and Tenant Act and its amendment, two processes were established relating to the administration of prescribed premises; the determination of fair rents and the hearing of applications for orders for the termination of tenancy agreements (recovery of possession). The Fair Rents Boards were responsible for the first of these functions.\n\nDetermination of Fair Rent\n\nUnder the Landlord and Tenant Act 1948 and the 1948 amendment to it, any dwelling-house except a holiday house or house on a farm property was a prescribed premise.7 If a prescribed premise was rented at any time after the commencement of the Act or at any time since 31 December 1940 (when rent was frozen under Commonwealth Regulations) then the Fair Rents Boards were responsible for determining rent.8\n\nEither a lessor or a lessee could make an application to a Board for the fair rent of the premises to be determined. In making such a determination the Board was to take into account not only the value of the property, level of rates and state of repair, but also the financial position of both the lessor and lessee and any likely hardship which may be caused by varying the level of rent.9\n\nThe categories of premises for which the Boards were responsible for determining rent altered over time as successive legislative amendments reduced the number of circumstances in which a rented premise was prescribed. Under an amendment to the Landlord and Tenant Act made in 1953, only those premises declared to be prescribed between 31 December and 1 February 1954 (the date the amendment Act commenced) were subject to Landlord and Tenancy Legislation and were required to apply to the Board for rent determination.10 Other amendments limited the application of the Act to leases involving tenants who had leased prescribed premises between 1941 and 1954,11 and in 1971 a further amendment made provision for the lessor of prescribed premises to apply to a Board for the premises to cease to be prescribed if it was believed that this would not cause financial hardship to the tenants.12\n\nBetween 1954 and 1982, therefore, the Boards were responsible for rent determination of a gradually decreasing number of prescribed premises. A substantial proportion of these were leased to \"protected persons\" who had greater rights to the occupation of rented premises and hence remained in prescribed premises for a longer period of time.\n\nRecovery of Possession\n\nIn addition to providing for the determination of rent, the Landlord and Tenant Act 1948 also laid down provisions by which a landlord could require a tenant to vacate a prescribed premise. This was known as recovery of possession and was the responsibility of Courts of Petty Sessions, not Fair Rents Boards. Landlords could not terminate tenancy leases without such an order being made by a Court of Petty Sessions. The grounds upon which such an order could be made included that the tenant had failed to pay rent or take reasonable care of the premises, that the landlord required the premises for his or her own occupation, or in some circumstances, that the premises were to be sold.\n\nIn the case of protected tenants, who included discharges members of the allied forces, a female dependent or parent of a member of the forces or a recipient of certain types of war service pensions13, many of the grounds upon which an order for the recovery of possession could be made did not apply.14\n\nTransfer of Functions to the Residential Tenancies Tribunal\n\nIn 1982 all of the powers and responsibilities of the Boards were transferred to the Residential Tenancies Tribunal, which was established the previous year to adjudicate in a wide range of tenancy disputes.15 All arrangements for the administrative support of the fair rents determination function were transferred to the Ministry of Consumer Affairs which also provided administrative support to the Residential Tenancies Tribunal.16 At the same time, the Tribunal also took on all the powers and responsibilities relating to orders for the recovery of possession of prescribed premises however powers relating to this function were also retained by Magistrates' Courts (formerly Courts of Petty Sessions).17\n\nLocation of Records\n\nSee also List of Holdings 2nd edition 1985, section 3.7.4. As Fair Rents Boards could be constituted at any centre in the State where a Court of Petty Sessions (Magistrates Court) sat, it is possible that some records of the Boards are listed with other local court records. See List of Holdings 2nd edition 1985, section 2.\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17"

    "description": "Establishment/composition\n\nProvision for the establishment of Boards of Advice was made in Sections 15 and 16 of the Education Act 1872. Under this provision the Governor in Council could constitute and define school districts containing one or more schools with a Board of Advice elected for the District.\n\nEach Board consisted of between five and seven persons elected by the ratepayers residing within the district. The Governor in Council could appoint a Board if one was not elected. Board members held office for fixed periods, however, the Governor in Council had power to remove any member.\n\nFunction\n\nThe duties of Boards of Advice were defined in the 1873 Act as: -\n\n (I.) To direct with the approval of the Minister what use shall be made of school buildings after the children are dismissed from school or on days when no school is held therein; to suspend any school teacher for misconduct and report the cause of such suspension to the Minister:\n\n (II.) To report on the condition of the schools, as to the premises and their condition, whether new schools are required, and as to books, furniture, gymnastic appliances, or other requirements;\n\n (III.) To visit the schools from time to time, and to record the number of children present, and their opinion as to the general condition and management of the schools:\n\n (IV.) To use every endeavour to induce parents to send their children regularly to school, to compare the attendance of children at school with the roll for the school district, and to report the names of parents who fail or refuse to educate their children or send them to school:\n\n (V.) To recommend the payment by the Education Department of school fees or the grant of a scholarship or exhibition in the case of any child displaying unusual ability. '\n\nAbolition\n\nAll Boards of Advice were abolished under Section 12 of the Education Act 1910. The role performed by these Boards was effectively assumed by a new body known as the School Committee which under Section 14 of the Act was to be established within every school.\n\nLocation of records\n\nAlthough Section 13 of the 1910 Act specified that all books, papers and documents in the possession or under the control of any Board were to be handed to the Crown, the Public Record Office holds very few records of the various Boards. Those in custody are listed below and in Section 3.8.5 of the 1985 List of Holdings."

    "description": "R J Ellery was appointed by the Government in 1853 as the first Government Astronomer to establish an observatory at Williamstown. Initially, the main purpose was the supply of accurate time to shipmasters. After the recognition by the Government that basic surveys on trignometrical principles were essential for accurate mapping and survey, the operations of the Geodetic Survey were commenced in 1858 by starting a meridian line from Hobson's Bay to the Murray River.\n\nAs well as the determination and the laying out of the meridians of longitude and the parallels of latitude, a trignometrical survey was initiated simultaneously with a base line of five miles being determined on the plains near the Werribee River and a triangulation commenced aided by the points and stations erected on the most conspicuous mountain tops. Although far from complete the geodetic survey was, apart from the mapping of the Victoria - New South Wales border, abandoned in 1868.\n\nThe observatory moved from Williamstown to Domain Park with the Melbourne Observatory ready to commence work at the end of 1863. Initially, observations were limited to the requirements of the geodetic survey. In 1866 the Observatory took up a share of the observations for a southern survey catalogue of the stars and continued routine work for time and the determination of star positions.\n\nR J Ellery was succeeded as Government Astronomer in 1895 by P Baracchi. From 1915 until 1943 Dr J M Baldwin was Director of the Observatory. From 1943 the Commonwealth Government supervised the work of the Observatory as the Victorian Government had made the decision to close it. Until 1945, when the Observatory was closed by the Commonwealth, magnitude and time-service data continued to be supplied."

    "title": "Master in Equity, Supreme Court (also known as Master in Equity and Lunacy 1867-1923)",
    "description": "Law of Equity\n\nUnenacted law is made by the Courts without direct Parliamentary authority.\n\n The unenacted law is often called 'Common Law'. Strictly speaking, the Common Law is but a part of the unenacted law - the part developed mainly in three particular English Royal Courts, called Queen's (or Kings') bench, Common Pleas and Exchequer. There were other Royal Courts which attended to other types of cases, and built up other rule systems, such as the Court of Admiralty, which created a good deal of law concerning shipping; the most important of these other courts was the Court of Chancery, which created the system called 'Equity'. Equity to some extent supplemented and to some extent competed with the Common Law, and its rules could produce different results in a particular case from those which would have been produced by Common Law rules. In the nineteenth century, the Parliament at Westminster legislated to abolish the many historical superior Courts, merging them in a single set of Courts - the High Court of Justice. In the final stage of this process (1873-5), the Judicature Act also 'merged' or 'fused' all the various kinds of unenacted law; in particular Common Law and Equity with express provision in the latter case that where the inherited rules of the two systems conflicted, those of Equity should prevail. Victoria soon adopted this reform in full. (Sawer, Geoffrey, The Australian and the Law, Penguin Books, 1972.)\n\nIn A Dictionary of English Law 1882, (P.316) Charles Sweet LLB explained equity thus:\n ...the most important sense of the word equity is that in which it denotes a part of the general law of England, as opposed to what is called the common law (q.v.). The distinction is purely historical, and arose from the fact that in former times the common law Courts provided no remedy in many cases where one was required. Hence the custom grew up of applying for redress in such cases either to the king in parliament or to the king in council, who referred the matters to the chancellor. In later times petitions were presented to the chancellor direct. The chancellor, being an ecclesiastic, and keeper of the king's conscience, did not feel bound to follow the rules of the common law, but gave such relief as he thought the petitioner or plaintiff entitled to \"in equity and good conscience.\" For a long time \"equity\" was a indefinite standard of right and wrong, and was regarded as having the function of mitigating the rigour and supplying the defects of the common law without any limitation except the personal opinions of each chancellor; but in more modern times equity become as fixed in its principles, and as incapable of introducing new remedies without the authority of parliament, as the common law itself.\n\nThe Supreme Court in Equity ruled on matters including complicated land ownership, complex financial arrangements, execution of intestate estates where there was no apparent heir, and cases where the plaintiff was a minor. Prior to the establishment of the Supreme Court of Victoria, the Supreme Court of New South Wales for the District of Port Phillip (VA 914) was responsible for civil and criminal justice, including the hearing of Equity cases. The Supreme Court in Equity and its administration were the responsibility of the Master in Equity.\n\nMaster in Equity\n\nThe Master in Equity also held various other positions. Duties associated with these positions included:\n\n as Registrar, preserving and lodging all documents given in evidence; attending Court; making notes on decisions and giving effect to them by settling decrees or orders\n\n as Taxing Officer and Accountant General, arranging payment of costs in equity proceedings, conveyancing and other business of the Court\n\n undertaking duties of the Custodian of Wills\n\n as Master in Lunacy, being responsible for administering the estates of \"lunatics, minors and fools.\"\n\nUntil a separation of the offices in 1859, the Master in Equity had also held the position of Chief Commissioner of Insolvent Estates. From 1867 to 1923 the Master in Equity was also known as the Master in Equity and Lunacy.\n\nThe Master in Equity, as Master in Lunacy, controlled and supervised the administration of the estates of:\n\n persons found to be lunatic by inquisition (their estates were managed by individuals known as \"committees\" who were appointed by the Court following an enquiry by the Master in Equity)\n\n persons admitted to public mental hospitals or mental homes\n\n persons incapable of managing their own affairs, but not admitted to an institution, and who were of unsound mind. The Master was not able to assume control of the estates of persons who were not of unsound mind but who were nevertheless incapable of managing their own estates due to senility or illness.\n\nIn some areas of the Master's responsibility concerning lunatics, persons of unsound mind, and those incapable of managing their own affairs, decisions required the prior approval of a Judge.\n\nThe Public Trustee Act 1939 (No.4654) amalgamated the offices of the Curator of Estates of Deceased Persons and those functions of the Master in Equity which concerned the administration of estates of patients in mental hospitals and persons incapable of managing their own affairs. These functions were assumed by the Public Trustee (VA 719). The Master in Equity continued to supervise the granting of probates and administration and the work of \"committees\". The Master in Equity was also responsible for the control and administration of the Probate Office and the Registrar of Probates received direction from the Master.\n\nIn 1883 under the Judicature Act (No.761) the position of Chief Clerk of the Supreme Court of Victoria had been established to relieve the Master in Equity of those responsibilities associated with the administration of matters not related to Equity. The Chief Clerk's functions were initially to assist the Judges, to take accounts and conduct investigations. The Chief Clerk later assumed responsibility for the Equity functions of the Master in Equity who was then primarily concerned with the control and management of estates, probate and administration and other business of the Court.\n\nThe Master of the Supreme Court Act 1948 (No.5329) amalgamated the offices of the Master in Equity and the Chief Clerk of the Supreme Court of Victoria and created the position of Master of the Supreme Court (VA 2613).\n\nLocation of Records\n\nFor records of the Master of Equity see also List of Holdings 2nd edition 1985, sections 2.2.1 (Master in Equity), 2.2.3 (Registrar of Probate) and 3.4.10 (Master in Equity)."

The intention was to help both sectors win contracts to export goods, services and consultancies, particularly joint ventures or multi-disciplined projects which might be beyond the scope of any individual company or government authority.\n\nEarly projects included export of Victorian-manufactured irrigation equipment to the Middle East, the drafting of mining legislation for the Kingdom of Tonga and conducting business training in Bahrain.\n\nOther Government agencies such as the Departments of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (VA 2649), Industry, Technology and Resources (VA 2661), Management and Budget (VA 1022), Water Resources (VA 2354 and VA 3132) and Sport and Recreation (VA 2691) worked in collaboration with the OPCV.\n\nMany of the OPCV's projects in Asia were related to infrastructure or public health and safety, including several where the client was AusAid.\n\nIn 2004 OPCV was purchased by VA 3748 Sinclair Knight Merz and became its International Development Assistance Division."

    "description": "Establishment\n\nThe Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1984 (No.10155) established the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT). The relevant sections of the Act came into operation on 5 December 1984. Section 19 of Act 10155 provided that the Tribunal would operate under two divisions, the General Division and the Taxation Division, as well as \"such other divisions as are prescribed\".\n\nPrevious Agency - Planning Appeals\n\nThe Planning Appeals (Amendment) Act (No.9 of 1987) created the Planning Division. On 1 August 1987 the Planning Appeals Board (PAB) (VA 1408) became the Planning Division of the AAT. In 1988 the possibility of a fourth division being created to encompass the functions of the Land Valuation Boards of Review (LVBR) was being considered. The LVBR was relocated on 4 January 1989 to the premises occupied by the Planning Division but continued to operate as a separate body. As at 1992 this situation continued.\n\nObjectives, Structure and Proceedings\n\nThe primary object of the Tribunal was to review administrative decisions upon their merits in an informal and expeditious manner and to permit a broad range of persons whose interests were affected by a decision to participate in a proceeding. Preliminary conferences were frequently employed by the Tribunal to identify points of law and to seek to reach agreement between parties to an appeal without the need to proceed to a full hearing.\n\nAct 10155 defined the Tribunal as consisting of a President and such number of Deputy Presidents and other members as was required. The President was to be a judge of the County Court. The Deputy Presidents were to be judges of, or qualified for appointment to, the County Court. Other members were to be legal practitioners or to possess special knowledge or skills relative to matters which may have been heard before the Tribunal. Act 9 of 1987 provided that a member could be appointed to a particular division. It further provided that all members of the PAB became members of the AAT; the Chief Chairperson of the PAB became a Deputy President of the AAT.\n\nFunctions\n\nUnder Act 10155 the Tribunal, in its General and Taxation Divisions, had jurisdiction to hear appeals against decisions made under certain sections of the following acts:\n Adoption; Business Franchise (Tobacco); Criminal Injuries; Compensation; Energy Consumption Levy; Estate Agents; Financial Institutions Duty; Freedom of Information; Gift Duty; Land Tax; Motor Accidents; Payroll Tax; Probate Duty; Stamps; State Employees Retirement Benefits Fund; Infertility (Medical Procedures).\n\nFrom 1 August 1987, when the functions of the PAB were assumed by the AAT, Act9 of 1987 provided that the Planning Division of the Tribunal had jurisdiction in relation to appeals under various sections of the following acts:\n Alpine Resorts; Cluster Titles; Drainage Areas; Drainage of Land; Environment Protection; Extractive industries; Health; Historic Buildings; Latrobe Regional Commission; Local Government; Mines; Port Phillip Coastal Planning and Management; Soil Conservation and Land Utilisation; Strata Titles; Town and Country Planning; Transport Act; Upper Yarra Valley and Dandenong Ranges Authority; Water.\n\nThe Tribunal's jurisdiction may be extended or reduced by further legislative changes.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nSome records of this agency have been transferred to archival custody, see list below."

The Commission can also examine, report and make recommendations to the Attorney-General on any matter which the Commission considers raises relatively minor legal issues which are of general community concern if the Commission is satisfied that the examination of such a matter will not require a significant deployment of resources available to the Commission.\n\nThe Commission may also suggest to the Attorney-General that a proposal or matter relating to law reform in Victoria be referred to the Commission by the Attorney-General; and to monitor and co-ordinate law reform activity in Victoria.\n\nThe Act also empowered the Attorney-General to grant references to the Commission and also empowered the Attorney-General to give directions to the Commission as to the priority in which the Commission is to accord each reference and the length of time within which it is to report. The Attorney-General is also empowered to seek interim reports from the Commission when appropriate.\n\nThe Law Reform Commission was abolished by the Law Reform Commission (Repeal) Act 1992.

This resulted in the recommendation by the Public Bodies Review Committee that the various water and sewerage authorities be abolished and a new structure set up. This re-structuring was legislated by the Water and Sewerage Authorities (Restructuring) Act 1983 (Act No. 9895). The objectives of this Act were the following:\n- to create interim administrative arrangements designed to facilitate the effective and efficient operation of the urban water industry in Victoria,\n- to make that industry more structurally coherent and to reduce its geographical and functional fragmentation,\n- to reduce the total number of bodies responsible for the supply of water and sewerage services,\n- to define the role of the Minister in the development of new structures and procedures in the urban water industry, and\n- to promote the more efficient, economic and effective allocation and utilization of the State's water resources.\n\nAs a result of this Act, new water and sewerage authorities referred to as Water Boards were created by Order-in-Council and the details of their constitution were published in the Government Gazette.\n\nUnder this Act, the South Gippsland Water Board was constituted by an Order-in-Council dated the 29th of May 1984. Foster Waterworks Trust (VA 2090), Toora Waterworks Trust (VA 2163), Fish Creek Waterworks Trust (VA 2088), Toora Sewerage Authority (VA 2037) and Foster Sewerage Authority (VA 1979) were abolished and their geographical areas, functions, land, liabilities, obligations, powers, property, rights and employees became the responsibility of the new Water Board. The boundaries of the former Waterworks Trusts, Urban Districts, and Sewerage Districts became the boundaries of the new Water Board. The Board was to consist of eight members, two each to be elected by the voters of the Toora and Foster Electoral Districts, one to be elected by the voters of the Fish Creek Electoral District, one to be elected from the Councillors of the West Riding of the Shire of South Gippsland (VA 2511), one to be elected from the Councillors of the Centre riding of the Shire of South Gippsland, and one to be elected from the Councillors of the East Riding of the Shire of South Gippsland.\n\nThe Order-in-Council was enforced from the 1st of July 1984, and continued until a further program of structural reform took place under the Water Act 1989 (Act No. 80/1989). Under this Act, the South Gippsland Region Water Authority was constituted by Order-in-Council. This was to take effect from the 1st of January 1995. This Order stated that the South Gippsland Region Water Authority was responsible for the staff, liabilities, obligations, land, property and functions of the South Gippsland Water Board from that date."

    "description": "Establishment\n\nThe Melbourne Tramways Trust, also referred to as the Municipal Trust, was established under the provisions of the fourth schedule to the Melbourne Tramway and Omnibus Company Act 1883 (No.765).\n\nA Member's Bill had been introduced in Parliament with the purpose of authorising the Melbourne Tramway and Omnibus Company Limited (M.T. & O.C.Ltd) (VA 2976), to construct and operate Melbourne tramways. The Company had been registered in 1877 and purchased the property and assets of the Melbourne Omnibus Company Limited which operated horse bus lines.\n\nBefore the Bill was passed a Municipal Conference in September 1882 decided that it would be better if the tramways could be constructed by a body representing interested municipalities and that the Company should operate the tramways under lease since the municipalities were disinclined to part with their control of the streets to any body. The Bill was amended accordingly.\n\nMembership of the Trust\n\nThe Trust was set up to represent the municipalities interested in tramways. It consisted of seven members from the Melbourne City Council and one from each of the eleven other municipalities in which tramways were to be constructed. The Trust thus included representatives from Prahran, Richmond, Fitzroy, Collingwood, South Melbourne, the town of Hotham and the Boroughs of St. Kilda, Brunswick, Port Melbourne, Hawthorn, and Kew.\n\nTransfer of Powers\n\nThe Trust was authorised to be the agency responsible for the construction and operation of the tramway system in Metropolitan Melbourne and by means of a notarial instrument dated August 1884 the powers conferred on the M.T. & O.C.Ltd by the Act, were transferred to the Trust. The responsibility for operating the tramway system was leased to the Melbourne Tramway and Omnibus Company under a contract for a period of 30 years, until 30 June 1916. The cable tramways operated by the Company were the property of the municipalities represented on the Trust. The whole tramway system was to be handed over to the Municipal Trust on the expiry of the lease.\n\nOperation of the Trust\n\nThe Act required that the Trust report monthly to the respective municipal councils regarding all contracts entered into, works undertaken and expenditure incurred by it. The Trust was authorised to borrow for construction purposes by means of debentures or loans secured on the lines themselves and on the revenues of the constituent municipalities. The lines when constructed were to be leased to the Company. The interest paid by the Trust on the loan was to be refunded to the Trust by the Company.\n\nThe Company paid the Trust a sinking fund on the amount borrowed, which was then invested and reinvested by the Trust in government debentures or stock. The Company and the Trust were to enter into an agreement before borrowing money for major construction. The State was exempted from any ultimate financial responsibility in what was essentially a local undertaking.\n\nThe first meeting of the Trust was convened by the Town Clerk of Melbourne on 4 March 1884 and was held on 7 March 1884. The work of the Trust was carried out by three Committees namely the Works Committee, the Legislative Committee and the Finance Committee. The Legislative and Finance Committees were amalgamated in December 1885.\n\nFollowing a conference with the M.T. & O.C. Ltd., it was decided that the main lines would be operated by an underground cable system. The branch lines to Kew and Hawthorn and those to South and Port Melbourne, West and North Melbourne were to be worked by horses, since the routes contained too many curves to be suitable for a cable system. Subsequently a change of routes for the latter four lines led to their conversion to cable traction.\n\nPending the finalisation of financial arrangements the Trust arranged in October 1884 for the Company to construct the Richmond line. The Company was to charge the Trust cost only, to be repaid when the loan was floated. The line was duly completed and opened for traffic on 11 November 1885.\n\nOpening Dates of Tramway Lines\n\nRichmond 11 November 1885 (a)\nCollins St and Fitzroy 20 October 1886 (a)\nVictoria St East 22 November 1886\nCollingwood and Clifton Hill 10 August 1887\nBourke St and Nicholson St 26 August 1887\nBrunswick 01 October 1887\nCarlton 21 December 1887\nKew (incomplete) 28 December 1887\nSt Kilda 11 October 1888\nPreston 26 October 1888\nKew horseline August 1890\nHawthorn 27 January 1890\nRoyal Park horseline 10 March 1890 (b)\n\n(a) Built by the Company as agent of the Trust, pending the floating of the first loan.\n\n(b) Constructed and operated by the M.T. & O.C.

The Tramway Board Act 1915 (No.2818) also provided for the transfer of employees to the Tramway Board.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nSee list below."

    "description": "Establishment of the Tramway Board\n\nThe Tramway Board was constituted under the provisions of the Tramway Board Act of 30 December 1915 (No.2818) to be a temporary authority responsible for the cable tramway system pending the establishment of a tramway authority to administer the whole of the tramways.\n\nThe Board was appointed by the Governor-in-Council on 18 January and its first meeting was held on 28 January 1916.\n\nTransfer of Responsibilities to the Board\n\nThe Act provided for the transfer of responsibility for the cable system from the Melbourne Tramway and Omnibus Company (VA 2976) and the Melbourne Tramways Trust (VA 2692) (with the exception of the Northcote Municipal Cable line (VA 520)) when the Company's lease expired on 30 June 1916. However, following the expiry of its lease, the Melbourne Tramways and Omnibus Company demanded compensation for the loss of its assets. Negotiations were protracted and the dispute was finally resolved by a decision of the Supreme Court in 1919.\n\nOther Tramways\n\nThe suburban municipal councils continued to conduct their own electric tramway services. Due to the temporary nature of the Board and to the war, no major changes in the administration of the transport system were attempted. There were, within or on the fringe of the Metropolitan area, electric tramways run by:\n\n(i) North Melbourne Electric Tramway and Lighting Company Ltd (VA 2974)\n(ii) Prahran and Malvern Tramways Trust (VA 2977)\n(iii) Hawthorn Tramways Trust (VA 2978)\n(iv) Melbourne, Brunswick and Coburg Tramways Trust (VA 2971)\n\nTramways were also run by several independent trusts and companies which were allowed to continue to work their own lines.\n\nThe Melbourne Tramways Trust (VA 2692) was dissolved on 1 March 1916 and its liabilities and assets were transferred to the Tramway Board. The liabilities consisted of debentures which matured on 30 June 1916, and were met by the realization of the Sinking Fund. On the expiration of the Melbourne Tramway and Omnibus Company's lease on 30 June 1916, the Board also took over the operations of the tramways. In addition to the lines constructed by the Trust, the Tramway Board also acquired from the Melbourne Tramway and Omnibus Company Limited, the Royal Park Horse tramway (on lease), various car houses, tramway repair shops and other assets. The Board also ensured the rights of the municipalities, the state and the persons employed by the Company and the Trust.\n\nHandover to Melbourne and Metropolitan Tramways Board\n\nIn accordance with the Melbourne and Metropolitan Tramways Act 1918 (No.2995) responsibility for the entire Metropolitan Tramways were transferred to the Melbourne and Metropolitan Tramways Board (M.& M.T.B.) (VA 2694). The temporary Tramway Board ceased to exist on 1 November 1919 when the first meeting of the M.& M.T.B. was held.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nSee list below."

    "description": "Establishment\n\nThe Melbourne and Metropolitan Tramways Board (M. & M.T.B.) was established under the provisions of the Melbourne and Metropolitan Tramways Act 1918 (No.2995). The Board was established to operate, control, manage and maintain all tramway undertakings and tramways constructed by, vested in, transferred to, or acquired by it. The Board was authorised to construct and to complete the existing tramways. By an order of the Governor-in-Council dated 22nd July 1919, the seven members of the Board, including a Chairman and a Deputy Chairman were appointed.\n\nUnder the provisions of a further Order-in-Council, the first meeting of the M. & M.T.B. was held on 1 November 1919 and under the provisions of the Act, this was deemed to be the date on which the majority of the sections of the Act, came into operation. The M. & M.T.B. was an independent statutory body which reported to the Minister of Public Works until 1952 and subsequently to the Minister of Transport.\n\nThe M. & M.T.B. was given responsibility for the operation of all tramways within a sixteen kilometre radius of the General Post Office. The only exceptions were the lines operated by the Victorian Railways.\n\nTakeover of Existing Tramways\n\nThe M. & M.T.B. was deemed to be the successor of the Cable Tramway Board (VA 2693) and the Royal Park Horse Tramway. These cable tramways (except the Northcote Cable Tramway, which was taken over on 20 February 1920) were taken over by the Board on 1 November 1919. The assets and obligations of the following suburban tramways were transferred to the Board on 2 February 1920:\n\n Prahran and Malvern Tramways Trust (VA 2977)\n Hawthorn Tramways Trust (VA 2978)\n Melbourne, Brunswick and Coburg Tramways Trust (VA 2971)\n Fitzroy, Northcote and Preston Tramways Trust (VA 2972)\n Footscray Tramway Trust (VA 2973)\n Northcote Municipality Cable Tramways (VA 520)\n\nOf the respective tramways taken over by the M. & M.T.B. the Footscray and the Fitzroy, Northcote and Preston Tramways were only in the process of construction at the time the M. & M.T.B. was established. The construction of the Fitzroy, Northcote and Preston Tramways was completed on 1 April 1920 and the Footscray Tramways on 6 September 1921.\n\nThe M. & M.T.B. did not take over the North Melbourne - Essendon Electric Tramways (VA 2974) at the time it took over the other suburban lines. The Government eventually bought the Company's interest in both the lighting and tramways undertakings and transferred the tramway function to the Board by a subsequent Act (3247) which came into operation on 21 December 1922.\n\nAdministrative Structure\n\nInitially the various tramways and their administration were grouped into three systems as follows:\n\n Cable System\n (i) Metropolitan Cable Tramways\n (ii) Northcote Cable Tramways\n\n Eastern System\n (i) Prahran and Malvern Electric Tramways\n (ii) Hawthorn Electric Tramways\n\n Northern System\n (i) Melbourne, Brunswick and Coburg Electric Tramways\n (ii) Fitzroy, Northcote and Preston Electric Tramways\n (iii) Footscray Electric Tramways\n\nIn 1923 centralisation of the management of these systems resulted in all three systems being brought under the supervision of a traffic superintendent who was responsible to a newly appointed manager for the operation of the combined system.\n\nThe accountancy departments of the three systems were amalgamated and transferred to the head office under the Secretary's Department. The Secretary was the signatory to all the official correspondence of the Board. The individual departments had to channel all their correspondence through the Secretary. The Chairman of the Board occasionally handled some correspondence personally. However, generally the Secretary handled all matters pertaining to the Board, drew up agenda for meetings, acted upon the decisions taken by the Board and negotiated on all property matters.\n\nThe Engineer's Department was placed under a Chief Engineer (T.P. Strickland) on 1 October 1921. The supervision of the permanent way, power Houses, power supply, rolling stock and buildings as well as the construction and conversion of cable tramways to electric traction was carried out by the Engineer's Department. The Chief Engineer was responsible for all engineering matters eg, civil. mechanical, electrical, architectural, design, maintenance and construction work, all contracts concerning buses and trams and purchases of vehicles. From 1939 to 1952 (from T.P. Strickland's retirement to the appointment of a new Chief Engineer) the officers in charge of each sub-department reported directly to the Chairman of the Board.\n\nDevelopment of Tramways\n\nUnder Section 34 of the Act, the Board was directed to prepare and adopt a \"General Scheme\" which was to provide a plan or framework upon which a systematic extension could be carried out, and to provide a basis for the future development of the tramways of the Metropolis. The proposal envisaged a vast expansion of the tramway system with several new lines.\n\nThe proposals for the \"General Scheme\" were submitted to the Commissioner of Public Works and were referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Railways for consideration and report.\n\nThe Melbourne and Metropolitan Tramways Board Act 1918 provided for the creation of an \"Appeals Board\" consisting of one representative appointed by the Board, one elected by the employees and an independent Chairman appointed by the Governor-in-Council. The Appeals Board was established to hear appeals from employees' against dismissals, fines, deduction from wages, reduction in rank, grade or pay and other punishments inflicted' by the Board.\n\nIntroduction of Bus Services\n\nFollowing the proclamation of the Melbourne and Metropolitan Tramways Act 1923 (No.3308), the Board was empowered to operate omnibuses. The Motor Omnibuses Acts of 1924 and 1925 removed competition on tramway routes. The power conferred on the Board to operate buses was intended only to be subsidiary to its main function of tramway operations.\n\nParks and Gardens\n\nThe M. & M.T.B. was also empowered to purchase lands for use as parks or gardens. Wattle Park was acquired as part of the tramway undertaking of the Board. The Board took over the debenture liability on Wattle Park from the Hawthorn Tramways Trust and developed the park as a place of recreation.\n\nAdministrative Restructures 1952 and 1983\n\nThe Transport Act 1951 (No.5559) transferred responsibility for the administration of the Melbourne and Metropolitan Tramways to the Minister of Transport. The Act came into operation on 14 March 1952.\n\nResponsibility for the functions of the M. & M.T.B. passed to the Metropolitan Transit Authority (VA 1044) in a major administrative restructure in 1983 with the passing of the new Transport Act 1983 (No.9921) which came into operation on 1 July 1983.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nSee list below and inventories of series for other tramway trusts mentioned in this text."

    "description": "The Chief Secretary was responsible for the administration of the Hospitals and Charitable Institutions Acts until 1923 when, following the proclamation of the Hospitals and Charities Act 1922 (No.3260) the Charities Board of Victoria was established and the Treasurer became responsible for its administration\n\nFrom 1864 the Hospitals and Charitable Institutions Acts had provided for the incorporation of any institution, society or association which had been established with the object of saving human life, promoting health, temperance or morality, preventing cruelty or vice or for other philanthropic or humane purposes and which was funded entirely or in part by voluntary contributions. Such institutions were governed by trustees and committees or boards of directors elected by contributors.\n\nMany of these institutions received financial assistance from the Government and by 1882 an Inspector of Industrial and Reformatory Schools and Public Charities had been appointed within the Chief Secretary's Department (VA 475). In 1895 the Inspector of Charities was transferred to the Department of the Treasurer (VA 2886).\n\nEstablishment of Charities Board of Victoria 1922\n\nThe Charities Board of Victoria (VA 2707) was established under the provisions of the Hospitals and Charities Act 1922 (No.3260). The Board comprised fourteen members representing the Metropolitan Hospitals Association, the Country Hospitals Association and the committees of metropolitan and country subsidized institutions and benevolent societies. The Board was responsible for benevolent societies and institutions which were supported in whole or in part by voluntary contributions and which had as one of their objects the provision of \"charitable relief to diseased, infirm, incurable, poor or destitute persons (including children and convalescent patients)\".\n\nMany institutions, including those wholly maintained by the State; institutions established under the provisions of the Lunacy Acts, Mental Treatment Act 1915 and Inebriates Act 1915; hospitals i.e. those receiving no aid from the State; municipal hospitals and institutions; institutions established by the Commonwealth Government; the Queen's Memorial Infectious Diseases Hospital at Fairfield and the Sanatorium at Heatherton for patients suffering from tuberculosis were to be exempt from the provisions of the Act.\n\nThe Act further provided for the appointment of an Inspector of Charities who was to be the ex officio secretary of the Board and whose appointment was not subject to the provisions of the Public Service Act. The Inspector of Charities was responsible both to the Charities Board and to the Treasurer (VA 623) who was the Minister responsible for the administration of the Hospitals and Charities Acts from 1923 until 1944 when responsibility was assumed by the Minister of Health (VRG 39).\n\nPowers and Responsibilities of the Charities Board\n\nThe Board was responsible for determining what charitable relief was required to meet the needs of diseased, infirm, incurable, poor or destitute persons resident in Victoria and which institutions or benevolent societies should be subsidized. The Board was also responsible for the allocation of funds from the Hospitals and Charities Fund which was to be established and kept in the Treasury in accordance with section 42 of the Act. The Board could recommend to the Minister that subsidized institutions be closed or amalgamated and that subsidized benevolent societies cease to exist, if they believed them to be mismanaged or to be failing to effectively provide the services for which they were responsible. The Board could also recommend for what purposes a subsidized institution should be used.\n\nFrom the commencement of the Act no institution or benevolent society could be established without the prior consent of the Board and all existing institutions and societies were to apply to be registered with the Board. Unregistered institutions and societies were not eligible to receive funds from the Hospitals and Charities Fund, consolidated revenue or municipalities and were prevented from making appeals for voluntary contributions. The Board was empowered to refuse or cancel the registration of an institution.\n\nThe Act further provided for the incorporation and government of hospitals and philanthropic institutions other than those run by religious denominations; the regulation of fund raising; the liability of patients for the cost of their care and treatment; the resumption of land for the benefit of institutions and the making and publication of regulations. The second and third schedules to the Act listed the names of existing incorporated institutions and separate institutions (i.e. those established by religious denominations).\n\nIn 1948 following the proclamation of the Hospitals and Charities Act 1948 (No.5300) the powers and responsibilities of the Charities Board were assumed by the newly established Hospitals and Charities Commission (VA 693).\n\nNote: For further information about the administration of health from 1836 to 1989 see VRG 39 Health.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nFor records of the Charities Board of Victoria and its successor see List of Holdings 2nd edition 1985, section 3.11.4.

    "description": "In accordance with the provisions of An Act for protecting the Crown Lands of this Colony from Encroachment, Intrusion and Trespass 4 Will IV No.10 1833, \"Commissioners of Crown Lands in the Colony of New South Wales\" were to be appointed. They were to have the power of Bailiffs and were to prevent any unauthorised intrusion, encroachment or trespass on crown lands. They were authorised to make \"perambulations and surveys\" of crown lands and to require the assistance of Justices of the Peace when necessary. They were also authorised to erect landmarks or beacons in a manner approved by the Surveyor-General to denote crown lands and their boundaries.\n\nIn the following year, settlement in the Port Phillip District was authorised and Captain William Lonsdale was appointed Police Magistrate. An Act to restrain unauthorised occupation of Crown Lands 7 Will IV No.4 became operative in 1836. This Act provided for the issue of annual licences to depasture cattle and other animals on lands beyond the limits of location. Regulations governing the issue of these licences were published in the New South Wales Government Gazette of October 5 1836 and the Commissioners of Crown Lands were to be responsible for giving effect to the regulations. Renewal of depasturing licences was subject to the approval of the Commissioner of Crown Lands on whose report a licence could be cancelled. Surveyors Robert Russell and Frederick Robert D'Arcy were appointed Commissioners of Crown Lands in September 1836.\n\nThe Civil Establishment of 1839 for Port Phillip District cites a single Commissioner for Crown Lands - H F Gisborne. By 1840 there were Commissioners for Western Port and Portland Bay and by 1843 there were Commissioners of Crown Lands for Portland Bay, Western Port, Gippsland, Murray, the County of Bourke and the County of Grant. By 1846 a further Commissioner for the Wimmera District, proclaimed on 9 November 1846, had been added to the Civil Establishment.\n\nAdministration of Crown Lands\n\nThe Commissioners of Crown Lands reported to the Superintendent until 1851 and then to the Colonial Secretary until 1853 when F A Powlett was appointed as Chief Commissioner of Crown Lands and head of the Crown Lands Department (VA 2878). This Department was to be responsible for the sale, occupation and exploration of crown lands. With the establishment of responsible government in 1855, the Surveyor-General became the Minister responsible for the Commissioners of Crown Lands until March 1857 when the Commissioner of Crown Lands and Survey was appointed to the Ministry.\n\nIn 1857 the Board of Land and Works (VA 744) was established and the powers of the Commissioner of Crown Lands and Survey were vested in the Board. In 1858 a Commissioner of Crown Lands and Survey was reappointed to the Ministry, but statutory responsibility remained with the Board of Land and Works of which the Commissioner was President. From 1857 the Commissioners of Crown Lands were located within the Department of Crown Lands and Survey (VA 538), a sub-department of the Board of Land and Works.\n\nDuties of the Commissioners\n\nThe duties of Commissioners of Crown Lands included the prevention of unauthorised occupation of crown land; regulation of the boundaries of pastoral runs; prevention of encroachment and settlement of disputes; prohibition of cattle stealing and the impounding of stray beasts; collection of fees payable for government licences and collection of the stock assessment tax. The Commissioners dealt with applications for depasturing licences and provided each settler with a stock assessment notice. Commissioners also prepared returns for the Colonial Secretary regarding licensed runs and their occupants, the employment and conduct of the Border Police under their command and a monthly itinerary of their own activities. The Commissioners were also responsible for preventing clashes between the settlers and the Aborigines and as part of their duties as honorary protectors of Aborigines, they were required to visit reserves, report on the condition of the Aborigines and to supply them with food and clothing in cases of extreme emergency.\n\nIn 1853, the recently appointed Chief Commissioner of Crown Lands, F.A. Powlett, described the field duties of the Commissioners as being, \"estimating the grazing capabilities of runs, the value of land allotted under pre-emptive right, visiting the localities where new runs have been tendered for, preventing the unlawful occupation of Crown Lands, and the performance of other services\". He described their official duties as being, \"the recommendation of all transfers of runs, the examination of claims to purchase land under the eighth clause of the Orders in Council. The preparation of reports and returns and general correspondence with the Government and the public.\n\nIn the unsettled parts of the colony and in Districts beyond the boundaries of location, the Commissioners of Crown Lands also acted as Stipendiary or Police Magistrates. In correspondence accompanying the Return of duties performed by the Commissioners of Crown Lands from 1 January to 20 October 1853, (Papers Presented to Parliament 1853/54, Vol.3), F.A. Powlett, reported that the discharge of their Magisterial duties occupied so much of the Commissioners' time that they were unable to properly perform their duties as Commissioners of Crown Lands.\n\nBorder Police\n\nIn 1839, an Act (2 Vic No.27) provided for the establishment of the Border Police. The Act authorized the levying of a tax on cattle and other animals depastured beyond the boundaries of location to defray in part the expense of maintaining the Border Police. Standing Orders for the Border Police published in the Victoria Government Gazette of 22 May 1839 placed the Border Police under the command of the Commissioners of Crown Lands who were to report monthly on the conduct of each individual. Instructions from the Colonial Secretary's Office to the Commissioners of Crown Lands dated 20 June 1846, required them to discharge the Border Police from 30 June 1846 since no further provision had been made for them within the Appropriation Act, although they were permitted to retain half a division if there had been a recent clash between the Aborigines and the settlers.\n\nA Confidential Circular to Commissioners of Crown Lands from the Colonial Secretary's Office dated 20 June 1846 warned them of an imminent loss of powers following the expiry of provisions of Act 2 Vic No.27. They were no longer to have the power to settle disputes between the occupiers of crown lands nor to call for returns of stock. They were further informed that while their powers to remove intruders were in doubt, it remained unlawful for anyone to occupy crown lands without a licence and the Commissioners were to continue to report any unauthorised occupation.\n\nReplacement of Commissioners with District Surveyors\n\nSome secondary sources such as the Victorian Year Book (e.g. 1968) have suggested that following a reorganisation of the Department in 1857, Commissioners of Crown Lands were replaced by District Surveyors. There is some support for this view in the report of the Civil Service Commission of 1859/60 which states that the Legislative Assembly had made no provision for the continuation of the Land Occupation Branch to which the Commissioners belonged. This report also affirms that District Surveyors had been appointed to act as Commissioners of Crown Lands. The Civil Establishment for 1858, however, continues to cite a Chief Commissioner of Crown Lands and Commissioners of Crown Lands for Wimmera and Portland Bay but there is no reference to the Commissioners for the other districts.\n\nThere is evidence to suggest that the duties of the Commissioners of Crown Lands were carried out by officers who held other positions in the Civil Service. William Piper, who was the Commissioner of Crown Lands for the Murray District (VA 2711) continued to carry out duties associated with this position at least until 1860, although from 1858 he is listed in the Civil Establishment as the Police Magistrate, Benalla (see VPRS 7294). Appointments of Commissioners of Crown Land are found in the Government Gazettes for this period, but the appointees usually hold another substantial position eg. as Police Magistrate or Resident Warden and the Commissioner of Crown Lands positions are not designated by district. Further research is required to determine the final year in which Commissioners of Crown Lands were appointed."

Regulations governing the issue of these licences were published in the New South Wales Government Gazette of October 5 1836 and the Commissioners of Crown Lands were to be responsible for giving effect to the regulations. Renewal of depasturing licences was subject to the approval of the Commissioner of Crown Lands on whose report a licence could be cancelled. Surveyors Robert Russell and Frederick Robert D'Arcy were appointed Commissioners of Crown Lands in September 1836.\n\nThe Civil Establishment of 1839 for Port Phillip District cites a single Commissioner for Crown Lands - H F Gisborne. By 1840 there were Commissioners for Western Port and Portland Bay and by 1843 there were Commissioners of Crown Lands for Portland Bay, Western Port, Gippsland, Murray, the County of Bourke and the County of Grant. By 1846 a further Commissioner for the Wimmera District, proclaimed on 9 November 1846, had been added to the Civil Establishment.\n\nAdministration of Crown Lands\n\nThe Commissioners of Crown Lands reported to the Superintendent until 1851 and then to the Colonial Secretary until 1853 when F A Powlett was appointed as Chief Commissioner of Crown Lands and head of the Crown Lands Department (VA 2878). This Department was to be responsible for the sale, occupation and exploration of crown lands. With the establishment of responsible government in 1855, the Surveyor-General became the Minister responsible for the Commissioners of Crown Lands until March 1857 when the Commissioner of Crown Lands and Survey was appointed to the Ministry.\n\nIn 1857 the Board of Land and Works (VA 744) was established and the powers of the Commissioner of Crown Lands and Survey were vested in the Board. In 1858 a Commissioner of Crown Lands and Survey was reappointed to the Ministry, but statutory responsibility remained with the Board of Land and Works of which the Commissioner was President. From 1857 the Commissioners of Crown Lands were located within the Department of Crown Lands and Survey (VA 538), a sub-department of the Board of Land and Works.\n\nDuties of the Commissioners\n\nThe duties of Commissioners of Crown Lands included the prevention of unauthorised occupation of crown land; regulation of the boundaries of pastoral runs; prevention of encroachment and settlement of disputes; prohibition of cattle stealing and the impounding of stray beasts; collection of fees payable for government licences and collection of the stock assessment tax. The Commissioners dealt with applications for depasturing licences and provided each settler with a stock assessment notice. Commissioners also prepared returns for the Colonial Secretary regarding licensed runs and their occupants, the employment and conduct of the Border Police under their command and a monthly itinerary of their own activities. The Commissioners were also responsible for preventing clashes between the settlers and the Aborigines and as part of their duties as honorary protectors of Aborigines, they were required to visit reserves, report on the condition of the Aborigines and to supply them with food and clothing in cases of extreme emergency.\n\nIn 1853, the recently appointed Chief Commissioner of Crown Lands, F.A. Powlett, described the field duties of the Commissioners as being, \"estimating the grazing capabilities of runs, the value of land allotted under pre-emptive right, visiting the localities where new runs have been tendered for, preventing the unlawful occupation of Crown Lands, and the performance of other services\". He described their official duties as being, \"the recommendation of all transfers of runs, the examination of claims to purchase land under the eighth clause of the Orders in Council. The preparation of reports and returns and general correspondence with the Government and the public.\n\nIn the unsettled parts of the colony and in Districts beyond the boundaries of location, the Commissioners of Crown Lands also acted as Stipendiary or Police Magistrates. In correspondence accompanying the Return of duties performed by the Commissioners of Crown Lands from 1 January to 20 October 1853, (Papers Presented to Parliament 1853/54, Vol.3), F.A. Powlett, reported that the discharge of their Magisterial duties occupied so much of the Commissioners' time that they were unable to properly perform their duties as Commissioners of Crown Lands.\n\nBorder Police\n\nIn 1839, an Act (2 Vic No.27) provided for the establishment of the Border Police. The Act authorized the levying of a tax on cattle and other animals depastured beyond the boundaries of location to defray in part the expense of maintaining the Border Police. Standing Orders for the Border Police published in the Victoria Government Gazette of 22 May 1839 placed the Border Police under the command of the Commissioners of Crown Lands who were to report monthly on the conduct of each individual. Instructions from the Colonial Secretary's Office to the Commissioners of Crown Lands dated 20 June 1846, required them to discharge the Border Police from 30 June 1846 since no further provision had been made for them within the Appropriation Act, although they were permitted to retain half a division if there had been a recent clash between the Aborigines and the settlers.\n\nA Confidential Circular to Commissioners of Crown Lands from the Colonial Secretary's Office dated 20 June 1846 warned them of an imminent loss of powers following the expiry of provisions of Act 2 Vic No.27. They were no longer to have the power to settle disputes between the occupiers of crown lands nor to call for returns of stock. They were further informed that while their powers to remove intruders were in doubt, it remained unlawful for anyone to occupy crown lands without a licence and the Commissioners were to continue to report any unauthorised occupation.\n\nReplacement of Commissioners with District Surveyors\n\nSome secondary sources such as the Victorian Year Book (e.g. 1968) have suggested that following a reorganisation of the Department in 1857, Commissioners of Crown Lands were replaced by District Surveyors. There is some support for this view in the report of the Civil Service Commission of 1859/60 which states that the Legislative Assembly had made no provision for the continuation of the Land Occupation Branch to which the Commissioners belonged. This report also affirms that District Surveyors had been appointed to act as Commissioners of Crown Lands. The Civil Establishment for 1858, however, continues to cite a Chief Commissioner of Crown Lands and Commissioners of Crown Lands for Wimmera and Portland Bay but there is no reference to the Commissioners for the other districts.\n\nThere is evidence to suggest that the duties of the Commissioners of Crown Lands were carried out by officers who held other positions in the Civil Service. William Piper, who was the Commissioner of Crown Lands for the Murray District (VA 2711) continued to carry out duties associated with this position at least until 1860, although from 1858 he is listed in the Civil Establishment as the Police Magistrate, Benalla (see VPRS 7294). Appointments of Commissioners of Crown Land are found in the Government Gazettes for this period, but the appointees usually hold another substantial position eg. as Police Magistrate or Resident Warden and the Commissioner of Crown Lands positions are not designated by district. Further research is required to determine the final year in which Commissioners of Crown Lands were appointed."

    "description": "Establishment\n\nThe Department of the Premier was established in December 1936 superseding the Premier's Office (VA 672), a sub-department of the Department of the Treasurer (VA 865).\n\nRelationship to Subordinate Agencies and Statutory Bodies\n\nThe Department often took on responsibility for new Government initiatives and priority areas. In such cases it was common for a Minister to be commissioned with direct responsibility for the function while agency responsibility was exercised by an administrative unit within the Department of the Premier. The Department of the Premier will therefore be listed as a Department of State for the Ministerial Group that had the direct responsibility. It is assumed that the Department of State, as a superior agency, would have exercised some degree of responsibility for financial, personnel and other administrative functions including record-keeping. If the administrative unit has been registered as a separate agency it is likely that the unit exercised greater independence from the Department than a unit that has not been registered.\n\nExamples of this situation where the administrative units have not been registered separately from the Department are those units that were responsible for regional development and decentralisation which were located in the Department of the Premier from 1943 to 1971 although they were responsible to the Minister for State Development and Decentralisation (VRG 51).\n\nExample of this situation where the administrative units have been registered as separate agencies include the Tourist Development Authority (VA 2918) which was located within the Department from 1958 to 1970 although it was responsible to the Minister for State Development and Decentralisation (VRG 51) and the Ministry of Fuel and Power (VA 627) which was located within the Department from 1965 to 1975 although the responsible Minister was the Minister of Fuel and Power (VRG 47).\n\nFrom 1975 to 1982 a Ministry for Federal Affairs was established within the Department.\n\nThe Department also provided financial and personnel services to the following bodies:\n Agent-General for Victoria (in London) (VA 1829)\n Auditor-General (VA 1031)\n Public Service Commissioner/Board (VA 886)\n\nFrom 1936 to 1986 the Official Secretary to the Governor was located within the Department of the Premier however records maintained by the Official Secretary will be found attributed to the Governor (VA 466). Likewise, although the Clerk of the Executive Council has been located within the above Department since 1936 records will be found attributed to the Executive Council (VA 2903).\n\nEstablishment of Department of the Premier and Cabinet (VA 1039)\n\nIn 1982 the Department of the Premier and Cabinet was established (Victoria Government Gazette No.102, 13 October 1982) superseding the Department of the Premier.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nSignificant holdings of records have been transferred to the Public Record Office Victoria.\n\nSee also List of Holdings 2nd edition 1985, section 3.17.1."

    "description": "Establishment and Functions\n\nPrior to 1860, the Chief Secretary's Department (VA 475) had been responsible for the administration of the goldfields and associated mining activities. In November 1860 a Commissioner of Mines was appointed and a Department was established under his administration. For the period November 1861 to June 1863, the Postmaster General was responsible for the Mining Department. A Minister of Mines was again appointed in 1863.\n\nThe major responsibilities of the Department of Mines were:\n\nregulation of mining and related activities through the issue of miners rights, business and residence licences, mining leases, mineral and other prospecting licences\n\nsuperintendence of the activities of mining surveyors, registrars, wardens and Mining Boards (see VRG 25 Mining Districts for more information on these offices and agencies)\n\ninvestigation of the state's geological structure, mineral wealth and underground water resources\n\ndevelopment of the mining industry\n\nsupervision of the safe working of mines, machinery and quarries including the credentialling of mine managers, inspectors and operators\n\nregulation of the disposal of sludge and other waste products\n\nadministration of the Victorian Mining Accident Relief Fund.\n\nArising from its initial responsibility for the supply of water on the gold fields, the Department became responsible for rural water supply from the mid 1860s. Statutory responsibility for rural water works during this period rested with the Board of Land and Works (VA 744). In 1865 the Waterworks Act gave the Board power to construct waterworks, purchase land, levy charges and lease or sell works, while the Public Loans Act 1865 empowered it to provide loans to local water trusts for waterworks. The actual administration of these statutory provisions was undertaken by the Victorian Water Supply Department (VA 2787) which operated from 1865 to 1889 as a sub-department of the Department of Mines, from 1889 as a department in its own right, and from 1895 to 1909 as a sub-department of the Department of Mines and Water Supply (VA 2720). For a brief period from 1891 to 1893 the Department of Mines was also responsible for forests and, until 1880, for the Schools of Mines subsequently transferred to the Education Department (VA 714).\n\nIn 1895 the Department of Mines and the Victorian Water Supply Department (VA 2787) were amalgamated to form the Department of Mines and Water Supply (VA 2720).\n\nLocation of Records\n\nRecord holdings are patchy but include long runs of mining title records.

    "description": "Establishment and Functions\n\nIn 1895 the Department of Mines (VA 2719) and the Victorian Water Supply Department (VA 2787) were amalgamated to form the Department of Mines and Water Supply.\n\nThe new Department, in which the Victorian Water Supply Department continued to operate as a sub-department, was responsible for management of the rural water supply, including the provision of water for mining, manufacturing and industrial uses, domestic and stock supply and irrigation.\n\nStatutory responsibility for rural water works rested with the Board of Land and Works (VA 744) under the provisions of the Waterworks Act and the Public Loans Act 1865. Its statutory powers related to commissioning the construction of waterworks, purchasing land, levying charges, leasing or selling works, and providing loans to local water authorities. The Victorian Water Supply Department (VA 2787) functioned as the Board's operational arm in these matters.\n\nThe Department was also responsible for:\n\nregulating and licensing mining activity\n\nsuperintendence of the activities of Mining Surveyors, Registrars, Wardens and Mining Boards (see also VRG 25 Mining Districts)\n\ninvestigating the State's geological structure, mineral wealth and underground water resources\n\ndeveloping the mining industry\n\nsupervising the safe working of mines, machinery and quarries\n\nregulating sludge and other waste products until the establishment of the Sludge Abatement Board in 1904.\n\nIn 1909 the Department of Mines and Water Supply was abolished. From 1906 to 1909 the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission (VA 723) gradually assumed statutory and operational responsibility for all matters relating to rural water supply from the Board of Land and Works (VA 744) and Victorian Water Supply Department (VA 2787). The Mines Department inherited responsibility for the administration, regulation, licensing and development of mining activity in Victoria.\n\nState Forests and Nurseries\n\nResponsibility for this function was shared by a number of portfolios until 1909 when the Minister of Forests assumed responsibility for the Department of State Forests (VA 534). Until that time, responsibility had been exercised by:\n\nCommissioner of Crown Lands and Survey prior to 1875\nMinister for Agriculture (VRG 34) 1875-1890\nCommissioner of Crown Lands and Survey 1890-1891\nMinister of Mines (VRG 30) 1891-1893\nCommissioner of Crown Lands and Survey 1893-1899\nMinister for Forests 1899-1900\nCommissioner of Crown Lands and Survey 1900-1903\nMinister of Agriculture 1903-1904\nMinister of Mines and Forests 1904-1909.\n\nFor convenience each of the Ministers responsible for forests from 1900 to 1909 has been placed in the Forests Group (VRG 41) for the period of their responsibility for this function.\n\nUntil 1908 the Departments of Agriculture (VA 618), Crown Lands and Survey (VA 538), Mines (VA 2719), and Mines and Water Supply were at various times responsible for State Forests. In 1908 the Department of State Forests (VA 534) was established. Until it became a department of State in its own right in 1918, it functioned as a sub-department of the Mines and Water Supply Department until 1909 and thereafter of the Mines Department (VA 612). The Department of Mines and Water Supply has therefore been included in the Forests Group (VRG 41) for the period 1904 to 1909.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nRecord holdings at the Public Record Office are patchy.

The Companies Office was initially a branch of the Office of the Registrar General and the Office of Titles (VA 862) which was a division of the Law Department (VA 2825) but subsequently became a division in its own right. The Registrar of Companies assumed responsibility for functions previously administered by the Registrar General.\n\nResponsibilities of the Companies Office\n\nThe Companies Office was responsible for:\n\n administering the various provisions of the Companies Act 1958\n\n registering (or denying registration to) companies incorporated as either limited, unlimited, or, in the case of mining companies, with no liability to members; (The majority were \"limited liability\" companies either \"public\", in which the general public could hold shares, or \"proprietary\" () in which a maximum of fifty people could hold shares)\n\n preventing the use of undesirable trading names for companies, or names too similar to ones already existing\n\n registering \"foreign\" companies incorporated outside Victoria but with established places of business within Victoria\n\n registering the memorandum or Articles of Association of a company, its prospectus, and its allotment of shares\n\nThe Act also made provision for the winding up of companies, \"take-over\" offers, compliance with conditions where public subscriptions were involved, inspection and investigation of companies affairs, company directors and their responsibility to disclose interests in contracts and to register their shareholdings, the keeping, auditing and publication of company accounts, the holding of Annual General Meetings, the maintenance of a register of debenture holders, and the alteration of Articles of Association.\n\nThe Act made provision for a Companies Auditors Board to be established with responsibility for the registration and discipline of company auditors and liquidators.\n\nEstablishment of the Corporate Affairs Office\n\nIn 1974, in accordance with the provisions of the Interstate Corporate Affairs Agreement, the governments of Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria agreed to establish an Interstate Corporate Affairs Commission.

    "title": "Transport Regulation Board",
    "description": "Establishment Transport Regulation Board 1933\n\nThe first Transport Regulation Board was established by the Transport Regulation Act 1932 (No.4100) which was proclaimed on 16 February 1933. Under section 15 of the Act the Board was to prepare two reports, to be submitted to the Governor-in-Council, with respect to the efficient co-ordination, better regulation and control of railway, tramway, motor, sea and air transport. However in the time available the Board was only able to submit reports on railway and road motor transport. The Minister of Railways (VRG 32) was responsible for the establishment of the Board.\n\nFrom 1 January 1934 a second Transport Regulation Act 1933 (No.4198) came into operation. This Act re-constituted the Transport Regulation Board and, by amending section 15, provided for the Board to report to a responsible Minister. The first meeting of this reconstituted Board was held on 1 May 1934. By the time the Board submitted its first annual report in 1935 a Minister for Transport had been appointed as the Minister responsible.\n\nFunctions of the Board\n\nIn its initial reports to the Governor-in-Council the Board proposed that the \"first step towards 'the better and more economic co-ordination or the better regulation and control' of transport is the introduction of a system of licences and permits applied to all commercial road motor vehicles, both passenger and goods\", and that such a system be administered by a transport licensing authority. In effect the Transport Regulation Board became that authority, with primary responsibility for:\n\n licensing country commercial passenger vehicles including stage, touring and light motor omnibuses\n licensing of commercial goods vehicles\n licensing vehicles of commercial travellers\n regulation of vehicle standards and conditions\n regulation of passenger vehicle routes and timetables.\n\nResponsibility for licensing country commercial passenger vehicles had previously been the responsibility of the Country Roads Board (VA 722) under the provision of the Motor Omnibus Acts 1924-1929.\n\nThe introduction, in 1934, of more extensive licensing and regulation of motor transport services reflected the Government's concern with the increasing competition between transport services and the State's transport network.\n\nIt is evident that a significant role of the Board before 1951 was to conduct public hearings concerned with matters relating to the administration of transport services throughout the State. Hearings were held in metropolitan and country locations.\n\nExtension of Regulatory Role 1952\n\nWith the proclamation of Part III of the Transport Act 1951 (No.5559) on 1 February 1952 the Board became responsible for the licensing of all metropolitan passenger matters previously handled by the Melbourne City Council, and also urban passenger transport in Ballarat, Bendigo and Geelong previously controlled by the respective City Councils. Part II of the Act, introducing the licensing of commercial aircraft, was not proclaimed until 1 July 1952.\n\nThe Transport Act 1951 also established a Ministry of Transport (VA 673) \"for the purpose of securing the improvement, development and better co-ordination of railway, tramway, road and air transport in Victoria\" and empowered the Minister of Transport to utilize the services of officers employed within the various transport authorities.\n\nAs the Ministry primarily performed a co-ordinating function and did not carry out any operations, the licensing and regulation functions of the Transport Regulation Board were not significantly affected by this development.\n\nIn 1961 the Board became responsible, under the provisions of the Motor Boat Act 1961, for the registration of motor boats and the control of boating activities on Victorian waters.\n\nMotor Registration and Driver Licensing from 1981\n\nFollowing proclamation on 29 April 1981 of the Motor Registration Act 1980 (No.9403), the Transport Regulation Board assumed responsibility for the functions of the Motor Registration Branch, including motor registration and driver licensing, from the Office of the Chief Commissioner of Police (VA 724).\n\nRestructuring of Transport Portfolio and Abolition of Board 1983\n\nThe introduction of the Transport Act 1983 (No.9921) significantly influenced the administration of transport functions in Victoria, including the establishment of a Road Traffic Authority (VA 1036) which assumed all licensing and registration functions of the Transport Regulation Board.\n\nResponsibility for the co-ordination of urban bus services outside the metropolitan area, however, passed to the State Transport Authority (VA 1038).\n\nLocation of Records\n\nSee List of Holdings 2nd edition 1985, section 3.21.0."

    "description": "The State Electricity Commission of Victoria, Mid-Western Supply Region was initially established in 1934 taking over the organisation operated by the Electric Supply Company of Victoria. With headquarters at Ballarat, the Mid-Western Supply Region includes district centres at Ararat, Bacchus Marsh and Daylesford.\n\nThe State Electricity Commission of Victoria (VA 1002) Australia's largest electricity supply authority and individual coal producer. It was a semi-government authority with the principal responsibility of generating or purchasing electricity for supply throughout Victoria.\n\nThe Commission was established by an Act of Victorian Parliament in 1921 and operated under the State Electricity Commissions Act, 1958. Since it began operating the Commission has expanded and co-ordinated the generation, purchase and supply of electricity on a State-wide basis, to the stage where its system provided almost all the electricity produced in Victoria.\n\nRestructuring of the Victorian Electricity Industry\n\nIn 1993-1994 the State Electricity Commission of Victoria was disaggregated into three entities, covering mining and generation; transmission and system security; and distribution and retailing. The Electricity Industry Act 1993 (No. 130/1993) was the basis for implementing the government's objectives with regard to the structure and regulation of the Victorian electricity industry.\n\nWith the disaggregation and privatisation of the State Electricity Commission, the State Electricity Commission of Victoria, Mid-Western Supply Region was abolished and became part of the new private entities."

He suggested to acquire part of the land for a geriatric hospital. The PANCH board appointed a special sub-committee to follow up the matter. In December 1972 the Minister for Health, Mr John Rossiter, secured the land.\n\nIn December 1974, the complex received $200,000 for preliminary site work.\n\nIn May 1981 the Provisional Committee of Management received a proposal from the Health Commission suggesting that the first stage of building should comprise a day hospital and wards containing 44 beds, 22 beds in Ward 1 and Ward 2, at a total cost of $5 million.\n\nBundoora Extended Care Centre opened its doors to hospital clients on April 17, 1984. The Day Hospital (now Community Therapy Service area) was named after Cyril Barling.\n\nThere was an official opening of Bundoora Extended Care Centre (BECC) in 1984 by then Premier John Cain. In 1989 construction work began on what was to be a Nursing Home (now Percy Cleland Ward). It was completed in June 1990 but was unable to be utilised due to lack of funding to open it.\n\nThe Ian Brand Nursing Home opened on November 24th 1991.\n\nIn 1994 Merv Irvine Nursing Home opened. It was first intended to house war veterans but was subsequently utilized as a psychogeriatric facility for aged people with disabilities associated with disturbances of behaviour. It provided long term care for 30 residents and was part of Melbourne Health.\n\nIn 1995 BECC became part of the North Eastern Health Care network.\n\nIn 1996 Kath Atkinson Wing, a combined Geriatric Psychiatry and Geriatric Assessment Unit, was opened.\n\nIn 1997 BECC became part of the North Western Health Care network and in 2000 BECC became part of Northern Health."

The formation of the Branch represented a linking of the administration of the Children's Welfare Department (VA 1467) and the Penal and Goals Branch (VA 1464) both within the Chief Secretary's Department and arose from a recognition of the need to concentrate on the prevention rather than the mere alleviation of social problems. All functions of the former Children's Welfare Department and Penal and Gaols Branch were assumed by the Social Welfare Branch.\n\nThe Branch was administered by a Director-General of Social Welfare who was accountable to the Chief Secretary. Within the Branch, six divisions were established reflecting the new approach of the Government to social problems.\n\nFamily Welfare Division\n\nPrior to the establishment of this Division emphasis had mostly been placed on child behaviour rather than on parental neglect. The establishment of this Division acknowledged the dynamics of child/parent relationships and the need for preservation of the family unit. Its major functions were:\n\n promotion and development of family welfare\n co-ordination of voluntary organizations, government departments and persons concerned with the provision of welfare services for families\n control and supervision of children and young persons in need of care and protection, including foster care, adoption, wardship, infant life protection, child employment and child migrants\n management and control of state institutions for the reception and treatment of children and young persons including children's homes and reception centres\n provision of aftercare for children and young persons\n family counselling\n family assistance (financial)\n\nYouth Welfare Division\n\nThe establishment of this Division effectively separated the provision of services to delinquents from services directed at children requiring care and protection and hence acknowledged their different needs. The major functions of this Division were:\n\n administration of youth training centres and remand centres for young offenders\n classification of young offenders\n treatment and rehabilitation of young offenders\n after care of young offenders including accommodation in hostels and employment services\n prevention of delinquency through youth work/services programs\n\nPrisons Division\n\nSection 16 of the Social Welfare Act 1960 established the Prisons Divisions with two main functions:\n\n to control and supervise all persons imprisoned or detained in any gaol\n to assist in the rehabilitation into the community of all persons released or discharged from any gaol.\n\nPrior to the establishment of this division, the control of all prison services had been the responsibility of the Penal and Gaols Branch of the Chief Secretary's Department (VA 1464). The Penal and Gaols Branch had also been responsible for the provision of probation and parole services, however responsibility for these services was assumed by a Probation and Parole Division.\n\nUnder the Act, the Prisons Division was administered by a Director of Prisons accountable to the Director General of Social Welfare, who in turn reported to the Minister. The Division was responsible for the accommodation of prisoners, prisoner classification and the provision of prisoner support services such as education and prison industries.\n\nFor further information about the administration of prisons and correctional services, see VRG 9 Prisons and Youth Training Centres and VRG 93 Corrections.\n\nProbation and Parole Division\n\nThe administration of adult and youth probation and parole services in conjunction with the Adult Parole Board and the Youth Parole Board and the co-ordination of Children's Court probation services were the major responsibilities of this Division. Responsibility for the Children's Court probation services was inherited from the Law Department (VA 2825) in 1960.\n\nResearch and Statistics Division\n\nThe compilation of statistics and information regarding the Branch and related matters and the encouragement of research into social problems were the major functions of this Division.\n\nTraining Division\n\nThis Division was required to plan, supervise and co-ordinate the development of training for prison, childcare, youth and family welfare workers and to supervise the training of children, youths and adults in institutions controlled by the Branch.\n\nEstablishment of the Social Welfare Department\n\nUnder the provisions of the Social Welfare Act 1970 (No.8089) a Minister for Social Welfare was appointed in 1970 and subsequently, in 1971, a Department of State known as the Social Welfare Department (VA 946) was established and assumed responsibility for all functions previously administered by the Social Welfare Branch.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nFor records of the Social Welfare Branch see list below and the List of Holdings 2nd edition 1985, section 3.5.1.

    "title": "Victorian Water Supply Department",
    "description": "Background\n\nEarly attempts to provide water supplies for rural Victoria were made as a result of a mixture of local initiatives through the establishment of Water Trusts from the 1850's and Government action on the goldfields. The earliest reticulated supplies were developed in Bendigo (1858-1859), Ballarat (1860-1862) and Geelong (late 1860's).\n\nFrom 1861 reservoirs were constructed on the goldfields by the Public Works Department (VA 669) for the Board of Land and Works (VA 744); some were maintained by the Government, others leased to Water Trusts. The need for legislative control led to the passage of the Waterworks Act in 1865 which gave the Board of Land and Works power to complete and construct water works, to purchase land, levy charges, lease or sell works and provide loans to local Water Trusts (under the Public Loans Act 1865) to complete and construct water works. The actual administration of these statutory provisions came to be undertaken by the Victorian Water Supply Department (VWSD).\n\nEstablishment\n\nThe Victorian Water Supply Department was set up as a sub-department within the Department of Mines (VA 2719) in 1865 and its first Chief Engineer (H.O. Christopherson) appointed on 1 November (Civil Establishment of Victoria 1866, 1867). By 1867 all Public Works responsibilities for water reservoirs and water supplies to the goldfields had been taken on by the VWSD (Treasurer's Statements of Receipts and Expenditure for 1866 and 1867). The Chief Engineer's Report to 31 December 1867 to the Minister for Mines and Vice-President of the Board of Lands and Works reported on surveys undertaken of proposed works by Water Trusts and their works-in-progress, land purchases, administration of loans and the works under the direct control of the VWSD - Coliban (Sandhurst-Castlemaine), Geelong and Echuca (Parliamentary Papers 1868). Control and management of the Coliban and Geelong Schemes continued until they were taken over by the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission (VA 723) in 1905-1906.\n\nWater Conservation Acts 1881-1886\n\nThe need for better central regulation and co-ordination of rural water supplies led to an inquiry by a Water Conservancy Board and the subsequent passage of the first attempt at comprehensive legislation, the Water Conservation Act 1881 (subsequently amended between 1883 and 1886 and consolidated 1887). Its provisions, administered by the VWSD, included the constitution of and appointment of Commissioners for local Waterworks Trusts and Districts, including Urban Districts, their powers and duties, loans and rating, supply and sale of water.\n\nRoyal Commission on Water Supply 1884-1885\n\nContinuing dissatisfaction with the situation and the growing requirements of agriculture resulted in the setting up on 23 December 1884 of a Royal Commission on Water Supply with Alfred Deakin as President and Stuart Murray as Secretary. Its recommendations resulted in the Irrigation Act 1886 and the restructuring of the VWSD (see Further Progress Report to Parliament 31 August 1885).\n\nIrrigation Act 1886, Water Act 1890\n\nThe Irrigation Act 1886 vested water rights in surface water in the Crown, made the Minister responsible for promoting efficient storage and use of water resources for mining, manufacturing and industrial use, domestic and stock supply and irrigation, established \"national works\" and the responsibilities of the Board of Land and Works (VA 744), provided for irrigation and Rural Water Supply Districts and set down requirements for their constitution by the Governor-in-Council (specified boundaries, proposed works, water entitlement, water sources, rates, costs, loans, number of Commissioners), and provided for the issue of pumping leases and licences to construct water works. The VWSD administered the provisions of the Irrigation Act 1886 (subsequently consolidated with the Water Conservation Acts in the Water Act 1890) and took on operational responsibility for the statutory or lease responsibilities given to the Board of Lands and Works (VA 744) by the Act. These related to the administration of loans to water and irrigation trusts, surveys of water storage resources and improvement planning, surveying of rivers and streams, boring and exploration for underground water and construction and management of \"national works\" (ss.124-133 Irrigation Act 1886, ss. 283-291 Water Act 1890). \"National works\" were works declared by Act of Parliament to be of state wide significance. They were constructed and managed under the direct control of the State. The Chief-Engineer of VWSD was responsible for reporting to the Minister on the financial viability of proposed \"national works\" (s. 126 Irrigation Act 1886, s. 293 Water Act 1890).\n\nSeparation from Department of Mines (VA 2719) 1889\n\nFollowing the Royal Commission's recommendations on its restructuring, the VWSD became an independent agency in late 1889 (see Victoria Government Gazette 13 December 1889, p.4368 for abolition of position of Secretary of Mines and Water Supply on 12 December 1889). Stuart Murray (Secretary to the Royal Commission) had become its Chief Engineer in September 1886 (Victoria Government Gazette 10 September 1886 p. 2612) replacing William Heron Steel (also Inspector-General of Public Works). In January 1890 the Department acquired its own Secretary, H W Meakin (Civil Establishment Return for 31 December 1890 gives 17 January as the appointment date). At this stage the Department was organised into four Branches - Engineering, Correspondence, Accounts and Country (management of Coliban and Geelong Schemes).\n\nReamalgamation with Department of Mines 1895\n\nIn 1895 the VWSD was amalgamated with the Department of Mines (VA 2719), forming the Department of Mines and Water Supply (Victoria Government Gazette 31 May 1895 p. 1946 as of 22 May 1895). The VWSD continued to function much as before under Chief Engineer Stuart Murray as a sub-department of the Department of Mines and Water Supply (VA 2720), although its main accounting and audit responsibilities were undertaken by the latter's Accounts Branch.\n\nAbolition of the VWSD 1906-1910\n\nGradually there was a recognition that there was a need for a single more powerful and independent co-ordinating authority to manage the State's water resources. Inadequate water conservation, fragmented control, insufficient charges and irregular revenue had led to the failure of many Trusts. The Water Act of 1905 therefore vested overall responsibility for conservation and distribution of Victoria's rural water supplies for irrigation, industrial and\nurban purposes with the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission (VA 723). The VWSD's responsibilities relating to Water and Irrigation Trusts, water rights and those operations it carried out for the Board of Lands and Works (VA 744) under ss. 283-291 of the 1890 Act passed to the Commission. A few legislative provisions were still the responsibility of the Department's Chief-Engineer (eg. reporting on viability of proposed \"national works\" under s.293 1890 Act), but these were removed by the Water Act 1909 which formally merged the Department and its remaining staff into the Commission (proclaimed 4 January 1910 Victoria Government Gazette 19 January 1910, p 274). Stuart Murray, while still retaining the position of Chief-Engineer, became one of the first three Commissioners of the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission. In 1908 he was replaced as Chief-Engineer by Elwood Mead (the first Chairman of the Commission). The years 1906 to 1909 saw a gradual scaling down of the activities of the VWSD and transfer of its staff to the new Commission.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nSee List of Holdings 2nd edition 1985, section 3.23.0."

During its first years, the Commission was engaged in the construction of a natural gas pipeline from Longford to Dandenong. Once the pipeline was constructed, the Commission also oversaw the provision of gas through the pipeline and its maintenance.

The Act provided for the appointment of fifteen Commissioners representing various interests in the Port.\n\nThe first election and appointment of Commissioners occurred on 30 March 1877, followed by a meeting on 11 April 1877 at which office bearers were elected.\n\nFunctions\n\nThe long title of the establishing Act states as its purpose,\n \"to provide for the Regulation, Management and Improvement of the Port of Melbourne and certain portions of the River Yarra Yarra and certain portions of the Saltwater River....\"\nand thus identifies the key responsibilities vested in the Melbourne Harbor Trust Commissioners, which in more specific terms included the following major functions:\n\nRegulation of the trade of the port with respect to such matters as\n\\* landing of shipping of merchandise\n\\* arrivals and departures of vessels\n\\* wharfage rates\n\nManagement of port facilities such as wharves, piers, jetties, docks, ships, lights, buoys, beacons, moorings, tugs, workshops, water police, emergency services, and land adjacent to the port's waterways\n\nImprovements to the port including\n\\* widening and deepening the port's waterways\n\\* construction and maintenance of wharfage accommodation, docks and other port facilities as mentioned above\n\\* regular dredging operations\n\\* control of noxious trades and deposits of refuse within the port boundary\n\\* co-ordination of the above functions to ensure the efficient operation of all port activities.\n\nPrior to the establishment of the Trust there had been no co-ordinated management and development of the Port of Melbourne. Ports and harbours functions, including the control of vessel movements and berthings, provision and maintenance of navigational aids, and collection of wharfage rates, were previously the responsibility of the Ports and Harbours Branch which operated within the Department of Trade and Customs (see VA 606).\n\nDevelopment and Reconstitution\n\nOn 14 November 1883 two additional Commissioners were appointed under provisions of the Melbourne Harbor Trust Act Further Amendment Act 47 Vic., No.763 1883.\n\nUntil 1900 the Melbourne Harbor Trust Commissioners was responsible to the Commissioner of Trade and Customs (VRG 22) and thereafter to the Minister for Public Works (VRG 28).\n\nA major reconstitution of the Melbourne Harbor Trust Commissioners occurred in 1913. Under the Melbourne Harbor Trust Act 1913 (No.2449) the body of seventeen elected Commissioners was replaced by five Commissioners appointed by the Governor-in-Council.\n\nThe five Commissioners included a full-time Chairman and four representatives of the following : owners of ships, exporters, importers and primary producers. The first meeting of the new body occurred on 4 February 1913. Under the provisions the Melbourne Harbor Trust Act 1913, responsibility for the railway piers at Port Melbourne and Williamstown were also vested in the Commissioners with effect from 1 December 1913. This brought all wharves, piers and jetties within the Port of Melbourne under the authority.\n\nIn 1954 a sixth Commissioner was appointed to represent the interests of labour.\n\nEstablishment of Port of Melbourne Authority\n\nUnder the Port of Melbourne Authority Act 1978 the Melbourne Harbor Trust Commissioners was reconstituted as the Port of Melbourne Authority (VA 1426), with effect from 8 November 1978. Although the change of name, which was in line with modern practice with respect to the naming of organizations responsible for the operation of ports throughout the world, did not reflect a change in function, the Port of Melbourne Authority has been registered as a separate agency (see VA 1426).\n\nLocation of Records\n\nSee list below and also List of Holdings 2nd edition 1985, section 3.21.16 Melbourne Harbor Trust Commissioners."

The Superintendent apparently exercised joint responsibility with the Colonial Engineer from the latter's appointment in 1852. From separation in 1851, these colonial officials were responsible to the Colonial Secretary.\n\nEstablishment and Functions\n\nIn 1853, the Central Roads Board was established under the provisions of An Act for making and improving Roads in the Colony of Victoria (16 Vic., No.40). The Board consisting of three members appointed by the Lieutenant Governor, was to be responsible for the formation, construction, improvement, management and maintenance of proclaimed main roads and bridges and for the co-ordination of the works undertaken by the District Roads Boards. The Act provided for the appointment of a Secretary and Treasurer to the Board and for the appointment of an Inspector General of Roads and a staff of engineers, surveyors, clerks and other officers who were responsible to the Board. The Board was also responsible for the calling of tenders, determination of the position of toll gates, appointment of toll keepers, levying of tolls which were payable at any punt or ferry constructed at public expense at a rate which was determined by the Lieutenant Governor and for prosecutions for the non payment of tolls.\n\nMunicipal Responsibility\n\nIn rural areas the earliest local government authorities were concerned with roads. The New South Wales Parish Roads Act 1840 provided for the establishment of elective Road Trusts to maintain and repair roads in their areas. The first trust was Warringal (Heidelberg) in 1841. Under the provisions of Act 16 Vic.,No.40, District Road Boards were established and given responsibility for the construction and maintenance of roads and bridges other than those proclaimed as main roads. In the exercise of their powers District Road Boards were expected to comply with the requirements of any general plan established by the Central Roads Board for the development of the colony's roads and bridges and the Chairmen of the District Road Boards were entitled to attend the meetings of the Central Roads Board in an ex-officio capacity having the right to be heard but not to vote. District Road Boards also had the power to levy rates and tolls.\n\nThe Municipal Institutions Act 1854 provided for the establishment of Municipal Districts which were responsible for the construction and maintenance of local roads and bridges.\n\nAbolition\n\nThe Central Roads Board was abolished on 1 January 1858 under the provisions of the Board of Land and Works Act 21 Vic.,No.31 1857.

With the passing of the Act, common law rules affecting coroners no longer apply and coroners' responsibilities are confined to those specified in the Act.\n\nUnder the provisions of the Act, the State Coroner is responsible for the efficient administration and operation of the state's coronial system. Stipendiary magistrates are appointed as coroners by the Governor-in-Council and barristers and solicitors may be so appointed. Subject to the direction of the State Coroner, coroners are responsible for the investigation of all reportable deaths as defined by the Act and may initiate an investigation into certain fires.\n\nCoronial investigations may include the conduct of a formal public hearing or inquest and the holding of an inquest is mandatory for certain categories of reportable deaths including cases where homicide is suspected, where the deceased was held in care immediately prior to his/her death, where the identity of the deceased is not known and at the direction of the Attorney General or State Coroner. Many investigations are now conducted without the holding of an inquest.\n\nThe State Coroner is notified of all reportable deaths including those to be investigated by provincial coroners. The State Coroner may investigate any individual case at his/her own discretion or following referral by a provincial coroner. The Act removed the power of a Coroner to commit persons for trial but if a coroner believes that an indictable offence has been committed a report must be made to the Director of Public Prosecutions. A coroner may also make recommendations to the Attorney General on any matter arising from the investigation of a death including public health or safety or the administration of justice.\n\nResponsibilities of State Coroner\n\nUnder the provisions of the Coroners Act 1985, the State Coroner is required to:\n\nensure the efficient administration and operation of the State coronial system\noversee and co-ordinate coronial services throughout the State\nensure that all deaths in Victoria reportable to a coroner under section 3 of the Act are investigated\nensure that an inquest is held whenever one is desirable or essential as required under section 17\nissue guidelines to coroners to help them carry out their duties\nperform any other duties conferred or imposed on the State Coroner by the Act.\n\nThe Act also provided for the establishment of the Victorian Institute of Forensic Pathology which is required to provide and administer mortuary, pathology and related scientific services subject to the direction of the State Coroner. With the establishment of the Coronial Services Centre in South Melbourne in 1988, the integration of all functions has now been achieved within a facility which is staffed by a full time specialist team of coroners, coroners clerks, police attached to the Office, pathologists, social workers and other staff.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nThe Public Record Office has significant holdings of coronial records. See list below and List of Holdings 2nd edition 1985, section 2.4.0. (Coroners Court) and section 3.18.2. (Registrar General)."

    "description": "The Attorney General's Department (previously known as the Law Department and the Crown Law Department) is primarily responsible for the administration of the State's legal system including the management of the Courts system.\n\nDuring its early years this agency was variously known as the Attorney-General's Offices/Chambers, Law Offices of the Crown and Crown Law Offices, and more recently has been known as the Crown Law Department and the Law Department.\n\nAs from 1 March 1987 the Law Department became known as the Attorney-General's Department because the Government considered that the new name more accurately reflected the functions of the Department. The change was one in name only and there was no change in the functions for which the Department was responsible.\n\nFollowing significant machinery of government changes after the election of the first Kennett Government in October 1992, the Attorney-Generals Department was abolished. Under Administrative Arrangements Order No.114 the Department of Justice assumed responsibility for all of its functions.\n\nJoint Ministerial Responsibility\n\nWith separation from New South Wales on 1 July 1851, administration of the judicial system became the joint ministerial responsibility of the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General with a \"Chief Clerk\" as Secretary, and subsequently, as Permanent Head of the Department. Prior to this, the Superintendent of the Port Phillip District was ultimately responsible for the administration of the Courts system in the Port Phillip District.\n\nJoint ministerial responsibility for the Department continued until 1951 when, under the provisions of the Solicitor-General Act (No.5604), the Attorney-General became the sole political head of the Law Department, and the position of Solicitor-General became a non-ministerial appointment made by the Governor-in-Council. Between 1985 and 1992 the Premier (VRG 50) was responsible for the Solicitor General. In some ministries during the period 1861 to 1891, the Solicitor General was known as the Minister of Justice.\n\nAlthough the division of ministerial responsibilities was not constant for the entire period 1851 to 1951, the Attorney-General was usually responsible for the administration of the Supreme Court and its Officers and their staff who were employed in the Law Department. The Officers of the Supreme Court included the Master in Equity (also known as the Master in Equity and Lunacy 1867-1923) (VA 2624), the Master of the Supreme Court (VA 2613), the Register of Probates (VA 2620) the Sheriff and the Prothonotary.\n\nThe Attorney-General was also responsible for the Court of Insolvency and for the administration of the Crown Law Officers including the Crown Solicitor (VA 667), the Crown Prosecutors, the Parliamentary Draftsman and the Court Reporting Branch. The Attorney-General was responsible for the Curator of estate of deceased persons from 1931 and for its successor the Public Trustee (VA 719), for the Office of the Public Solicitor (VA 2282) from 1928 and for the Registrar General's Department (VA 2889), subsequently the Office of the Registrar General and Office of Titles (VA 862), the Commissioner of Titles (VA 2926) and the Office of Titles (VA 2888) and the Commissioner of Patents, all of which were part of the Law Department.\n\nThe Solicitor General/Minister of Justice were traditionally responsible for the staff and administration of the County Courts, Courts of General Sessions, Courts of Requests, Courts of Petty Sessions, Courts of Mines, Licensing Courts, Coroner Courts and Children's Courts and were thus responsible for the Police (later Stipendiary) Magistrates, Wardens, Clerks of Court and Coroners.\n\nFunctions of the Attorney-General's Department\n\nThe major functions for which the Attorney-General's Department is currently responsible include:\n\n the administration of justice including the operation of the Courts system in Victoria through the Courts Management Division\n the regulation of commercial and professional affairs through the Corporate Affairs Office\n the provision of legal and policy advice to the Attorney-General and the development and co-ordination of Government initiatives in the legal area\n the provision of solicitor services and legal advice to Government, its agencies and instrumentalities through the Office of the Victorian Government Solicitor\n the provision of legal drafting services to Government and Members of Parliament through the Chief Parliamentary Counsel's Office\n the implementation of Government policy concerning legal reform and regulatory matters and the provision of means to protect individual liberties and human rights through the Law Reform Commission, the Legal Aid Commission, the Public Advocate and the Office of the Commissioner for Equal Opportunity\n the provision of administrative and legal services to certain associated statutory bodies.(see below)\n\nA number of the agencies within the Attorney-General's Department have the status of associated administrative units and the heads of these units exercise the powers of a Chief Administrators under the provisions of the Public Service Act 1974 (No.8656) as amended by the Public Service (Amendment) Act 1984 (No.10046). Units having this status include the Office of the Victorian Government Solicitor (previously the Crown Solicitor) (VA 667), the Corporate Affairs Office (VA 679) and the Office of the Chief Parliamentary Counsel (VA 629).\n\nBrief History of Functions and Agencies associated with the Attorney-General's Department (previously the Law Department).\n\nCourts Management\n\nResponsibility for the management of the Courts system is currently exercised by the Courts Management Division which is responsible for the administration and the provision of services and staffing in the Supreme, County, Magistrates', Coroners' and Childrens' Courts and other boards and tribunals associated with the Attorney-General's Department.\n\nFor information about the history, operations and officers of the State's Courts see VRG 4 Courts and the Inventory of Series entries for the Supreme Court (VA 2549), and its officers including the Master in Equity (VA 2624), the Master of the Supreme Court (VA 2613) and the Registrar of Probate (VA 2620); the Coroners' Courts (VA 2263) and the local Magistrates Courts listed in the Inventory of Agencies for VRG 4 Courts.\n\nVictorian Government Solicitor\n\nThe Office of the Crown Solicitor (VA 667) was established in 1841 with the appointment of James Montgomery as Crown Solicitor. The Crown Solicitor was responsible for the conduct of criminal proceedings and civil litigation on behalf of the Government until 1983 when responsibility for the conduct of criminal proceedings, particularly those in the higher courts was transferred to the Director of Public Prosecutions (VA 2550).\n\nIn 1987 following an amendment to the Schedule Two of the Public Service Act the Crown Solicitor became known as the Victorian Government Solicitor. This Officer acts as solicitor to the Executive Government, Ministers, Government departments and instrumentalities and the Office provides legal services which range from the provision of legal advice, drafting and conveyancing services to the conduct of summary prosecutions and civil litigation. See also the Inventory of Series entry for VA 667.\n\nDirector of Public Prosecutions\n\nThis office was established in 1983 with the proclamation of the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1982 (No.9848) and assumed responsibility for those functions previously administered by the Criminal Law Branch of the Crown Solicitor's Office. The Director of Public Prosecutions (VA 2550) is responsible for the preparation, institution and conduct of criminal proceedings on behalf of the Crown in the Victorian Supreme Court (VA 2549) and County Court (VA 686) and where relevant, in the High Court of Australia. The Director of Public Prosecutions may also conduct prosecutions for summary offences and assist coroners in the conduct of an Inquest.\n\nAlthough the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions is to some extent associated with the Attorney-General's Department and responsible to the Attorney-General, it is quite independent of the Department and has the status of a separate administrative unit under the provisions of the Public Service Act 1974 (No.8656) as amended. The Director of Public Prosecutions has the powers of a Chief Administrator. (See also Inventory of Series entry for VA 2550).\n\nChief Parliamentary Counsel\n\nThe Office of Chief Parliamentary Counsel previously known as the Parliamentary Draftsman, is responsible for the preparation of Bills for introduction in Parliament. The Office also gives assistance to the Judges of the Supreme Court and to the Magistrates in the preparation of Rules of Court.\n\nThe Subordinate Legislation (Review and Revocation) Act 1984 (No.10169) conferred responsibility on the Chief Parliamentary Counsel to review statutory rules and advise on clarity, validity and compliance with guidelines before submission of the rule to the Governor in Council. For further information about subordinate legislation see VRG 20 Parliament.\n\nRegistration and Regulation of Companies\n\nPrior to the appointment of a Registrar of Companies under the provisions of the Companies Act 1958 (No.6455), the Registrar General had been responsible for the registration of companies. In 1959 a Companies Registration Office (subsequently the Companies office) (VA 2725) was established. The Office was initially a branch of the office of the Registrar General and Office of Titles (VA 862) but subsequently became a separate division of the Law Department.\n\nThe Companies Office was responsible for the administration of the Companies Act including the registration and regulation of companies and the registration of business names and for ensuring compliance with the provisions regarding matters such as company take-overs, the responsibilities of company directors, the registration of share holdings and the audit and publication of accounts.\n\nEstablishment of Corporate Affairs Office (VA 679)\n\nIn 1974 in accordance with the provisions of the Interstate Corporate Affairs Agreement, the governments of Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria agreed to establish an Interstate Corporate Affairs Commission, the members of which were nominated by the States' Attorneys-General. The Agreement sought to achieve greater uniformity in the law relating to companies and the regulation of the securities industry and to establish reciprocal arrangements and common standards and procedures with regard to such matters as the incorporation of companies; regulation of the securities industry and trading in securities; registration of prospectuses; approval of trust deeds; requirements relating to accounts and audit; proclamation of companies as investment companies and class and individual exemption powers relating to fund raising and to take-overs.\n\nUnder the provisions of the Companies (Interstate Corporate Affairs Commission) Act 1974 (No.8565) the powers of the Registrar of Companies were transferred to the Commissioner for Corporate Affairs and the Companies Office was renamed the Corporate Affairs Office.\n\nEstablishment of National Companies and Securities Commission (N.C.S.C.)\n\nThe National Companies and Securities Commission was established by the Commonwealth Government with the agreement of the States.\n\nThe N.C.S.C. f... truncated"

    "description": "The Warrnambool Harbour Board was the only agency established under the provisions of the Harbour Boards Act 1927 although the Act also made provision for the establishment of other Boards at Gippsland Lakes, Welshpool, Port Fairy and Portland. The Warrnambool Board was constituted by an Order-in-Council dated 29 May 1928. Prior to this date responsibilities were vested in the Ports and Harbours Branch of the Public Works Department (VA 669).\n\nConstitution\n\nThe Board consisted of seven members; one appointed by the Governor-in-Council and six elected by the ratepayers of the five subdivisions comprising the proclaimed Harbour Board District. This District was defined as including the entire City and Shire of Warrnambool, parts of the Borough of Koroit and parts of the Shires of Hampden, Heytesbury, Mount Rouse and Mortlake. The Board itself appears to have been responsible to the Commissioner of Public Works.\n\nFunctions\n\nThe duties of the Board were set out in Section 39 of the Act as entailing the \"exclusive management and control\" of the port, all shipping and port facilities as well as the general preservation and improvement of the port. Duties entailed such activities as dredging, construction of port facilities and the drafting of port regulations.\n\nAbolition\n\nTo finance operations, the Board derived revenue from the imposition of port tolls, rates and charges and a Harbour District Rate on all rateable land within the District which was collected on its behalf by the councils. The Board was also empowered to borrow up to 300,000 pounds by means of a Government loan as well as to acquire an overdraft not exceeding 10,000 pounds. It appears that the inability of the Board to secure this loan for what it saw as essential major port developments directly led to its demise. The decision to abolish the Board was made in September 1933 but according to the terms of the abolition agreement made with the Minister for Public Works, the Board was required to function until it had paid off its overdraft. It appears to have exercised nominal control for the next three years. The Board was officially abolished by an Order-in-Council dated 30 June 1936 with responsibilities being formally resumed by the Public Works Department (VA 669). Functions are currently exercised by the Port of Portland Authority.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nSee below."

The Act was not proclaimed until 31 January 1952 at which time the Authority became operative.\n\nEstablishment of Mental Hygeine Authority\n\nIn 1947 the Government appointed the Mental Hospitals Inquiry Committee, whose terms of reference included a review of the administration of Mental Hygiene.\n\nThe report of the Mental Hospitals Inquiry Committee, tendered on 9 March 1948, pointed out that the volume of work undertaken by the Director of the Branch was too great for one person. The Committee reported that many of the problems and inefficiencies encountered in the administration of mental hygiene stemmed from the fact that the Director had to rely on the Public Service Board for staff and the Public Works Department (VA 669) for any maintenance, repair or construction work. They concluded that \"the well-being of the mentally sick...should not have to wait upon the pleasure of two Departments which are far removed from them, and are only remotely interested in their welfare\".\n\nThe Committee recommended that the administration of the Mental Hygiene Acts and the Mental Deficiency Act, including authority for the Mental Hygiene Branch, should be vested in an independent board of three commissioners in whom would be vested responsibility for the complete control of buildings, equipment, staff and patients, and which would function as a self-contained unit.\n\nThe Committee also made recommendations as to the provision of improved hygienic conditions, diet and clothing, greater amenities for patients, increased inspection and improved staff conditions.\n\nIn 1950 the Kennedy Report on the Mental Health and Mental Hygiene Services in the state of Victoria was presented to the Minister of Health. Professor Kennedy had visited Victoria in 1949 and he recommended modifications and additions to the Mental Hygiene Bill; re-organisation of the Department; greater emphasis on early treatment and rehabilitation as opposed to custodial care; the provision of special services to mental defectives and improved training of personnel.\n\nThe new Authority of was established under the provisions of the Mental Hygiene Authority Act 1950 (No. 5519). The Act was not proclaimed under 31 January 1952 at which time the Authority became operative.\n\nThe Mental Hygiene Authority was responsible for the development and direction of policy relating to the provision of services to the mentally ill, for the administration of the Mental Hygiene Branch, Department of Health I (VA 2866) and for the administration of and public mental health institutions.\n\nThe Authority consisted of three members appointed by the Governor-in-Council: an expert in psychiatry as Chairman; a medical practitioner with some experience in psychiatry as Deputy-Chairman and a person with skill and experience in administration. The members of the Authority were not subject to the provisions of the Public Service Act. The Authority reported directly to the Minister for Health (VRG 39).\n\n\nPowers of the Mental Hygiene Authority\n\nIt appears that only some of the recommendations of the Mental Hospitals Inquiry Committee were fully implemented. While the Chief Medical Officer, the Chief Clinical Officer and the Medical Superintendents of the institutions were also made exempt from the provisions of the Public Service Act, the staff of the Mental Hygiene Branch remained public servants within the Department of Health I (VA 695). As the 1953 Annual Report indicates, the Authority still had the problem of dealing with the Public Service Board for all staffing matters, except those relating to medical officers. Therefore technically the Secretary of the Department of Health I had control over the staff of the Mental Hygiene Branch.\n\nHowever it appears likely that the Authority did have some effective control of the employees of the Mental Hygiene Branch (VA 2866) through the Secretary to the Authority, who was also to be the Secretary of the Branch (s.15 of the Act.) The Annual Reports of the Authority provide evidence of the Authority's high level of control and direction of staff.\n\n\nThe Authority was not empowered to purchase land and execute works as had been envisaged by the Mental Hospitals Inquiry Committee and section 10(h) of the establishing legislation makes it clear that the Authority was subject to the provisions of the Public Works Act 1928 (No.3758) when carrying out any maintenance or repair work on the institutions under its control.\n\nResponsibilities of the Mental Hygiene Authority\n\nThe functions of the Authority were to formulate, control and direct general policy and administration relating to the Mental Hygiene Acts. The Mental Hygiene Branch (VA 2866), a division of the Department of Health (VA 695), implemented policy.\n\nThe Authority was required:\n\n- to make provision for the improvement of the treatment and measures for the prevention of mental defect, disorder and disease\n\n;- to provide for the carrying out of research and investigations in relation to the causation and treatment of mental defects, disorder and disease;\n\n- to arrange for the inspection and control of institutions licensed as mental homes\n\n;- to furnish recommendations and reports to the Minister upon matters affecting the accommodation, maintenance, treatment and welfare of persons suffering from any mental defect, disorder or disease\n\n;- to provide the Minister with copies of reports required under the Act\n\n;- to publish reports, information and advice concerning mental illness and, with the approval of the Minister to arrange for the provision of places for the accommodation, maintenance, treatment and welfare of persons suffering from mental illness\n\n;- to arrange for the provision of special accommodation for the treatment of ex-service people suffering from mental illness\n\n;- to establish or assist in the extension or establishment of: outpatient clinics for advice and treatment in relation to mental or emotional disorder; hostels for the welfare and rehabilitation of persons who are or who have been under the control of the Mental Hygiene Branch; and a preventative service, including clinics to deal with retarded, defective and problem children.\n\nThe Mental Hygiene Authority replaced the Director of Mental Hygiene and the Chief Medical Officer of the Mental Hygiene Branch (VA 2866) was given the statutory powers of the Director in relation to the admission, transfer, trial leave and discharge of patients. The Chief Medical Officer was also responsible for the physical well being of patients while the Chief Clinical Officer was responsible for the treatment of mental disorders, research and the training of staff.\n\nMental Health Act 1959 (No.6605)\n\nIn 1959 the law relating to mental health was consolidated and significantly amended. The Mental Health Act 1959 (No. 6605) came into operation in 1962 established the Mental Health Authority VA 692."

    "description": "Establishment and Development of Services\n\nYarra Bend was the first permanent institution established in Victoria that was devoted to the treatment of the mentally ill. It opened in 1848 as a ward of the Asylum at Tarban Creek in New South Wales. It was not officially called Yarra Bend Asylum until July 1851 when the Port Phillip District separated from the Colony of New South Wales. Prior to the establishment of Yarra Bend lunatic patients had been kept in the District's gaols. Yarra Bend was proclaimed an Asylum under the provisions of the Lunacy Statute 1867 (No.309) in the Government Gazette in October 1867.\n\nFrom its establishment until 1905 the institution at Yarra Bend was known as an Asylum. This title emphasised its function as a place of detention rather than a hospital which provided treatment for mentally ill people who could possibly be cured. The Lunacy Act 1903 (No.1873) changed the title of all \"asylums\" to \"hospitals for the insane\". This Act came into operation in 1905. Despite the change in designation the function and structure of the agency was unchanged. The title was altered to reflect the community's changing attitude towards mental illness and the Victorian Government's approach to the treatment of mentally disturbed persons.\n\nAn asylum/hospital for the insane was any public building proclaimed by the Governor-in-Council in the Government Gazette as a place for the reception of lunatics. An asylum could also provide wards for the temporary reception of patients as well as long term patients. Patients could not be retained in an asylum without a warrant requesting their admission. Prior to 1867 the warrant was signed by the Governor. After this date the Chief Secretary (VRG 26) was responsible for this function. Under the provisions of the Lunacy Act 1914 (No.2539) patients could also be admitted to a hospital for the insane on a voluntary basis, that is, on the patient's own request for a specified period of time.\n\nThe Yarra Bend Asylum was situated near the junction of Merri Creek and the Yarra River quite near the current site of Fairlea Women's Prison.\n\nClosure of Yarra Bend\n\nOvercrowding and the primitive living conditions were problems at Yarra Bend over a long period of time. The overcrowding was relieved to some extent when new asylums were opened at Kew (VA 2840) Royal Park (VA 2845) and Mont Park (VA 2846) in the metropolitan area and Ararat (VA 2841) Beechworth (VA 2842) and Sunbury (VA 2843) outside the metropolitan district.\n\nHowever despite the opening of new institutions which relieved some of the pressure on Yarra Bend, by the early 20th century the facilities at Yarra Bend were clearly too old fashioned to facilitate more modern methods of treating mental illness. New admissions to Yarra Bend ceased in 1924 and the institution was finally closed in 1925. All remaining patients were transferred to Mont Park.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nSubstantial clinical and administrative records are held at the Public Record Office. See below."

In October 1872 Kew was proclaimed a separate institution from Yarra Bend.\n\nSince its establishment the title of the institution at Kew has been altered several times to reflect both the community's changing attitude towards mental illness and the Government of Victoria's approach to the treatment of mentally disturbed persons. Despite the changes in designation the function and structure of the agency has not altered significantly, therefore the institution has been registered as one continuous agency. From its establishment until 1905 the institution at Kew was known as an Asylum. This title emphasised its function as a place of detention rather than a hospital which provided treatment for mentally ill people who could possibly be cured. The Lunacy Act 1903 (No.309) changed the title of all \"asylums\" to \"hospitals for the insane\". This Act came into operation in March 1905. The Mental Hygiene Act 1933 (No.4157) altered the title to \"Mental Hospitals\".\n\nAn asylum/hospital for the insane etc. was any public building proclaimed by the Governor-in-Council and published in the Government Gazette as a place for the reception of lunatics. An asylum could also provide wards for the temporary reception of patients as well as long-term patients. The Mental Health Act 1959 (No.6605) designated hospitals providing short-term diagnosis and accommodation as \"psychiatric hospitals\". Therefore any institution could have a section designated as a mental hospital for long-term or indefinite hospitalization and a section designated as a psychiatric hospital for short term diagnosis and treatment of acute psychiatric illness. Any such designations of particular wards are published in the Government Gazette.\n\nPatients could not be retained in an Asylum without a warrant requesting their admission. Prior to 1867 the warrant was signed by the Governor. After this date the Chief Secretary (VRG 26) was responsible for this function. From 1934 the Director of Mental Hygiene (VA 2865) and from 1952 the Chief Medical Officer of the Mental Hygiene Branch (VA 2866) were successively responsible for admission of patients.\n\nThe Lunacy Act 1914 (No.2539) made provision for the admission of patients on a voluntary basis as well as by certification.\n\nIn October 1962 Kew was formally proclaimed a Mental Hospital under the Mental Health Act 1959 (No.6605).\n\nIn January 1982 wards G1, G3, and G4 of Kew Mental Hospital were proclaimed a Psychiatric Hospital under the provisions of the Mental Health Act 1959 (No.6605). There wards were known as the Willsmere Unit and were established to receive and accommodate short-term acute patients.

Its proclamation as an Asylum was published in the Government Gazette on 1 October 1867 under the provisions of the Lunacy Statute 1867 (No.309).\n\nPatients had previously been confined to the town's gaol due to lack of more appropriate accommodation. As the first patients were admitted, the men were put to work as farm labourers, carpenters, blacksmiths, painters, shoe-makers and tailors, while the women worked as launderers, knitters, seamstresses and domestics. From 1880, records indicate that recreational activities were introduced. In the ensuing years, additional buildings were added to meet demand for patients to be placed in the area.\n\nSince its establishment, the title of the institution at Beechworth has been altered several times to reflect both the community's changing attitude towards mental illness and the Victorian Government's approach to the treatment of mentally disturbed persons.

In 1952, the Mental Health Authority established the Open Door policy, demolishing the perimeter wall in 1955.\n\nBy the 1960s, a Nurse Training School and adjacent Nurses' Home had been established at the hospital, leading to major developments in nursing education.\n\nIn 1962, the Mental Retardation and Mental Hospital sections were officially separated.\n\nIn 1964, several wards were renovated, renamed and re-opened as a Training Centre specifically to care for and train more than 200 people with intellectual disabilities. Beechworth Training Centre operated within the institution from 1964-1990.\n\nIn 1967 the institution at Beechworth became widely known as \"Mayday Hills Hospital\" which included the Mental Hospital (1967-1991)and Psychiatric Hospital (1978-1995).\n\nIn 1977, the Psychiatric Hospital was proclaimed under the Mental Health Act 1959. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the development of other residential options (day placements, education, employment, and recreational opportunities) meant there were fewer clients.\n\nBy 1992, all intellectual disability clients had been removed from the hospital and placed in other forms of accommodation. By 1993, the Psychiatric Hospital had a capacity of 130 beds, with only 20 available for acute adult patients and more than 70 for geriatric patients.\n\nBy 1996, the Hospital consisted of two psycho-geriatric wards (Emerald and Amethyst), the Kerferd Acute Clinic, Willow, and external housing at Gilchrest Avenue and Mayday Court.

    "description": "Establishment and Development of Services\n\nThe institution at Ballarat was first proclaimed a Public Asylum under the provisions of the Lunacy Statute 1867 (No.cccix) in the Government Gazette of August 1877. Its first patients were transferred from Yarra Bend Asylum (VA 2839) to ease the crowded conditions there. Ballarat was to cater for the \"imbecile and idiot\" class of patient rather than patients suffering from acute insanity. Both male and female patients were in residence at Ballarat until 1878 when the buildings were handed back to the Department of Industrial and Reformatory Schools (VA 1466).\n\nIt was decided to reconvert the building to its original use as an Industrial School. All patients were transferred to the new Asylum at Sunbury (VA 2843) which the Hospitals for the Insane Branch (VA 2863) had just recently acquired from the Department of Industrial and Reformatory Schools.\n\nIn March 1893 that the Ballarat Asylum was reopened to relieve overcrowding in metropolitan asylums, and the facility came under the jurisdiction of Hospitals for the Insane Branch. Its proclamation as an Asylum was published in the Government Gazette on 17 March 1893.\n\nIn 1893, it was decided that Ballarat would specialize in the care of epileptics and three large wards each with 100 beds opened in 1902.

    "description": "Establishment od the Receiving House and Hospital for the Insane\n\nRoyal Park was opened as a Receiving House in September 1907. Receiving Houses were used to provide accommodation for those patients who required only short term diagnosis and treatment. No person was to be detained in a receiving house for more than two months in any event. Patients diagnosed as insane were transferred to a Hospital for the Insane by order of the Superintendent of the Receiving House.\n\nOn 7 April 1909 Royal Park was gazetted as a Receiving House and a Hospital for the Insane. The Receiving House and Hospital for the Insane/Mental Hospital operated concurrently, with some patients being transferred directly from the Receiving House to the Hospital for the Insane, or to other institutions.\n\nIn addition, a special Military Mental Hospital was opened at Royal Park in 1915. The date range of this agency is unknown\n\nSince its establishment the title of the institution as Royal Park has been altered to reflect both the community's changing attitude towards mental illness and the Victorian Government's approach to the treatment of mentally ill people Despite the changes in designation the structure and function of the agency has not altered significantly, therefore the institution has been registered as one continuous agency. The Mental Hygiene Act 1933 (No.4157) altered the title of all \"Hospitals for the Insane\" to \"Mental Hospitals\" (proclaimed 14.2.1934).\n\nA Hospital for the Insane/Mental Hospital was any public building proclaimed by the Governor-in-Council and published in the Government Gazette as a place for the reception of insane persons. A Hospital for the Insane\\Mental Hospital could also provide wards for the temporary reception of patients as well as long term patients.\n\nDevelopment of Services\n\nIn 1950, there were 201 patients at Royal Park Receiving House. Following the 1950 formation of the Mental Hygiene Authority, changes occurred across Victorias mental health services. Up until 1954 Royal Park functioned as a mental hospital for long term patients and a receiving house for short term patients. In April 1954 Royal Park's function as a Mental Hospital was revoked, published in the Government Gazette on 7 April 1954.\n\nFrom 1954 Royal Park has functioned as a hospital providing short term diagnosis and accommodation only. The Mental Health Act 1959 (No.6605) (operational since 1962) changed the title of \"Receiving House\" to \"psychiatric hospital\".\n\nResearch into mental health also developed within Royal Park with the opening of the Mental Health Research Institute in 1956 and the Central Library.\nUntil 1958, Royal Park was dealing with far too many metropolitan cases. The opening of Larundel and the regionalisation of metropolitan and surrounding country mental health services greatly reduced the number of patients for Royal Park to treat.\n\nSignificant renovations took place at Royal Park throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Four large aluminium structures were acquired for use as the social therapy centre for the early-treatment unit, and were modified to also provide a ward for insulin patients. It was complete with its own kitchen, a patients kiosk, a laboratory, a nurses home, a staff cafeteria, a geriatric ward and a nurses training school. The major structure converted Royal Park hospital, previously little more than a boarding house, into a full psychiatric unit. Both the Mental Hospitals Auxiliary and Country Womens Association performed significant contributions by furnishing and improving the appearance of wards.\n\nIn 1961, the school of Royal Park was constructed, vastly improving teaching facilities and the school, which served Beechworth, Sunbury, Kew and Royal Park hospitals, and the intellectual disability colonies at Kew Cottages and Travancore.\nImproving the facilities greatly enhanced the mental health services. In 1961 Royal Park had an adult outpatient facility and an early treatment hospital that also served alcoholics: in the early 1960s 40 per cent of men and 10 per cent of women admitted to Royal Park cited alcohol as the main cause of their illness.\n\nIn 1962, after the Mental Health Act 1959, the new Mental Health Authority named the facility the Royal Park Psychiatric Hospital.\n\nFrom 1965 to 1991, a separate unit also operated out of Royal Park known as Parkville Psychiatric Unit, which opened in October 1965 as a day hospital. Originally the unit treated adults but later changed to an adolescent only service.\n\nThe unit also served as a post-graduate teaching centre for the Mental Health Authority hospitals and accepted its first medical students in January 1966 from Melbourne University. Research studies were conducted at the unit as well as a Drug Information Service which was introduced in 1976. The Parkville Psychiatric Unit/Adolescent Unit closed in 1991.\n\nRoyal Park continued to develop and by 1975 was providing comprehensive short-term treatment for both voluntary and recommended patients. Royal Park had a large catchment area including suburbs from Altona to Essendon, Brighton through to Collingwood, Fitzroy, Coburg and Broadmeadows. Its outpatient services included Royal Park Outpatient Clinic, Clarendon Clinic and Elizabeth Street Clinic.\n\nRoyal Park provided diverse community mental health services within the context of Inner North and North West Community Mental Health Services. Royal Park worked with various mental health services such as Melville Clinic, North West Community Assessment and Treatment Team and Alexandra Parade Clinic, and had a pivotal role in delivering mental health services within a regional framework.\n\nOn the 7 May 1996 under section 94(4)(a) of the Mental Health Act 1986 (Victoria Government Gazette S.?) Royal Park function as an Acute Mental Hospital was revoked. In the same gazette was the notice of Proclamation of Centre for Young People's Mental Health, under section 94 (2) of the Mental Health Act 1986 (see below \"Conitnuing youth mental health services at Royal Park\").\n\nOn the 19 January 1999 under section 94(1)(b) of the Mental Health Act 1986 (Victoria Government Gazette S.11), Royal Park Hosital became \"North Western Health Care Network, Royal Park Hospital Mental Health Services\".\n\nThe Royal Park Psychiatric Hospital was decommissioned in 1999. After its closure inpatient psychiatric services were transferred to the new John Cade Building at RMH City Campus, under the umbrella of NorthWestern Mental Health.\n\nConitnuing youth mental health services at Royal Park\n\nThe original Receiving House continues to be used to house youth mental health services.

    "description": "\nEstablishment of a Hospital for the Insane\n\nMont Park Hospital for the Insane was opened in April 1912 under the Lunacy Act 1903. Its proclamation as a Hospital for the Insane was published in the Government Gazette on the 23 October 1912 (No. 23, p. 707). It was located on Ernest Jones Drive, Macleod.\n\nSince its establishment the title of the institution at Mont Park has been altered to reflect both the community's changing attitude towards mental illness and the Victorian Government's approach to the treatment of mentally ill persons. Despite the changes in designation the function and structure of the agency has not altered significantly, therefore the institution has been registered as one continuous agency. The Mental Hygiene Act 1933 (No.1873) altered the title of all \"hospitals for the insane\" to \"mental hospitals\".\n\nA hospital for the insane/mental hospital was any public building proclaimed by the Governor-in-Council and published in the Government Gazette as a place for the reception of lunatics. A hospital for the insane could also provide wards for the temporary reception of patients as well as long term patients.\n\nPatients could not be detained in a hospital for the insane without a warrant requesting their admission. Prior to 1934 the Chief Secretary (VRG 26) was responsible for this function. From 1934 the Director of Mental Hygiene (VA 2865) and from 1952 the Chief Medical Officer of the Mental Hygiene Branch (VA 2866) were successively responsible for admission of patients. The Lunacy Act 1914 made provision for the admission of patients on a voluntary basis, that is, on a patient's own request for a specified period of time.\n\nDevelopment of Services\n\nAfter World War 1, Mont Park catered primarily for mentally unwell military personnel, until Bundoora Repatriation Hospital opened in 1933. In 1925, when Yarra Bend Asylum closed, all patients were transferred to Mont Park.\n\nDuring the 1930s and 1940s Mont Park was regarded as the leading hospital for the treatment of mental illnesses. In 1941, Mont Park installed the Department's first X-Ray unit, and Victorian schizophrenics were first treated with insulin at Mont Park.\n\nIn 1951, Larundel was first opened as a ward of Mont Park, becoming a separate hospital in 1953. Royal Park and Larundel Hospitals acted as the receiving or acute admission centres for Victoria's mental health service, while Mont Park functioned as a long stay mental hospital.\n\nA new surgical unit also opened at Mont Park in November 1953. The following year leucotomy operations were performed (a leucotomy is a surgical interruption of nerve tracts to and from the frontal lobe of the brain).\n\nBy 1963, Mont Park's patient population had risen to 1500 and further facilities were required to accommodate the increasing demand for mental health services. In March 1963 Plenty Mental Hospital was established as one of three psychiatric institutions (Plenty, Larundel and Mont Park) on a large campus at Bundoora. At the time, this was still Melbourne's north east fringe. Like Larundel and Mont Park, Plenty had a mix of acute and extended-care wards, with the latter having a number of long-term patients.\n\nIn 1971, the Mental Health Authority changed policy and began moves for each major mental health hospital to provide a range of psychiatric care to specified Victorian catchment areas. For the north east region, including Preston, Northcote and Whittlesea, short-term treatment was allocated to Mont Park Psychiatric Hospital, and long-term rehabilitation to the Mont Park Mental Hospital. The Mont Park Psychiatric Hospital was a unit within the Mont Park Mental Hospital. Outpatient services were provided at the (former) Ernest Jones Clinic.\n\nMont Park continued its own administration until the formation of North Eastern Metropolitan Psychiatric Services (commonly known as NEMPS) (VA 5083) in 1991. Victoria Government Gazette, G32, 21 August 1991, page 2315, stated \"by this proclamation under section 94 (1) of the Mental Health Act 1986 of hte premises known as Mont Park Psychiatric Hospital excluding Wards M5 and M6 as an approved psychiatric hospital from 19 August 1991\".\n\n\nMilitary Mental Hospital\n\nIn 1915 a ward at Mont Park was taken over as a Convalescent Military Hospital. An agreement was made with the Defence Department for the latter to erect the Mont Park central block for use as a Military Hospital. This hospital was generally referred to as the Military Mental Hospital or the Military Mental Block, and primarily catered for ex-military personnel with chronic psychiatric illness.\nThere was also a hospital variously known as the Bundoora Farm or Homestead or the Repatriation Mental Hospital built on or near the current site of the Bundoora Repatriation Hospital. This agency was established in the 1920's to accommodate ex-military personnel suffering from psychiatric illness who were considered to be the better conducted cases.\n\nClose ties were apparently kept between this establishment and the military section of Mont Park Hospital for the Insane, as some records in the custody of the Public Record Office have both Mont Park and Bundoora as the recording agencies.\nThe military block at Mont Park was closed in 1924 and handed back to the State for civilian mental cases (See VA 5087 Bundoora Repatriation Hospital).\nLocation of Records\n\nSome clinical and administrative records are in the custody of the Public Record Office.

The first children were transferred to Janefield from Kew Cottages in 1937.\n\nJanefield was known as a \"Colony\" until 1962. In October 1962 Janefield was proclaimed a Training Centre under the provisions of the Mental Health Act 1959 (No.6605).\n\nFacilities available at Janefield Training Centre included a Special School, Farm, Gymnasium and a Family Unit.\n\nIn 1985 responsibility for the Janefield was transferred from the Mental Retardation Division of the Department of Health II (VA 2695) to the Office of Intellectual Disability Services, a division of Community Services Victoria (VA 2633). In 1996, when Janefield closed, its residents were transferred to other services for people with intellectual disabilities."

It was located in Preston.\n\nUnder the provisions of the Lunacy Act 1903 (No.1873) a Licensed House was defined as an institution which held a licence granted by the Chief Secretary (VRG 26) to house one or more insane persons. To obtain a licence it was necessary to pay an annual fee and meet conditions prescribed by the Governor-in-Council.\n\nThe licensee of the institution was also the superintendent. Licensed Houses were subject to much the same requirements in terms of patient care and record keeping as the hospitals for the insane. Often the license specified the sex and maximum number of patients it was allowed to receive.\n\nHouses accommodating over fifty patients were required to have a resident medical practitioner. Those accommodating between twenty-five and fifty patients were to be visited daily by a medical practitioner. Every other licensed house was to be visited twice a week by a medical practitioner.\n\nSt. Helens Licensed House was situated in Wood Street, Preston; part of its western border was situated on Gordon Grove. Its licence was first issued in 1916. In 1928 its name was changed to Pleasant View. On 29th June 1953, the institution was taken over by the Victorian Government and became a Receiving House (Victoria Gazette, No. 524, July 1, 1953, page 3186). It housed acute short-term psychiatric patients.\n\nUnder the Mental Health Act 1959, which was brought into operation on 1st November 1962, the facility changed its name from Pleasant View Receiving House to Pleasant View Psychiatric Hospital. Pleasant View's function as a mental health facility was discontinued in March 1973.\n\nThe institution was later an \"assessment centre for the reception and classification of alcoholics and drug-dependent persons\" (Victoria Government Gazette, No. 107, Wednesday November 6, 1974) and was known as a drug and alcohol rehabilitation centre, from 1973, until the institution closed in 1995.\n\nIt was an assessment centre under the Alcoholics and Drug Dependant Persons Act (1968). The Mental Health Authority Annual Report, for year ended 31/12/1973 (page 8) reported that \"... in May, 1973, outpatient facilities were at Pleasant View (Assessment Centre) and Day Hospital facilities commenced operation in August. Later in the year patient accommodation ... was increased to ... two in-patient units of 30 and 14 beds respectively ... at Pleasant View.\"\n\nSometime after Pleasant View closed in 1995, the facility became the Northern Community Care Unit, for services including psychiatric residential rehabilitation and community care.\nNOTE: All of the early patient records include both the Sunnyside Licensed House located in Camberwell (1905-1916), and St Helen's / Pleasant View Licensed House (1916-1953) in Preston.\n\nSunnyside was licensed until 1916 and St Helen's commencement coincides with the time that Sunnyside ceased to be licensed. For reasons that have not been determined, the records relate to patients that were in care before and later than 1916."

    "description": "The Children's Cottages at Kew were first opened in 1887 as a ward of the Kew Asylum (VA 2840) and termed the \"Idiot Ward\". The institution was established to provide separate accommodation for child inmates who had previously been accommodated with adult patients. Although the Cottages only admitted children as patients, many of those children remained in residence at the Cottages as adults.\n\nThe function of the institution was to provide accommodation and educational instruction for mentally retarded children. Some Wards of the State and other various \"difficult\" children were also admitted. During its later years, the institution no longer housed children and instead accommodated adults with intellectual disabilities.\n\nThe Cottages at Kew were known as the Kew Idiot Asylum from 1887 until c.1929. From 1929 they have been known as the \"Children's Cottages, Kew\" or alternatively \"Kew Cottages Training Centre\". Also in 1929, the Department of Education established the Kew Cottages Special School, the first school in Victoria for children with intellectual disabilities which remained in operation until the end of 1991.\n\nIn 1962 the Cottages were proclaimed a \"training centre\" under the provisions of the 1959 Mental Health Act (No.6605).\n\nIn 1982, responsibility for the Cottages transferred from the Mental Health Division to the Mental Retardation Division of the Health Commission. In 1985, responsibility for the Cottages transferred to the Office of Intellectual Disability Services, a division of Community Services Victoria.\n\nFollowing a tragic fire in April 1996 which killed nine men and a subsequent Coronial Inquest, the Department of Human Services renamed the site Kew Residential Services (KRS) in c.1997.\n\nIn May 2001, the Premier Hon Steve Bracks announced the Government's plan to redevelop the Kew Residential Services by relocating the residents to community based housing. The redevelopment was undertaken over a number of years, with the site finally closing in 2008.\n\nRecords of the Kew Cottages and Mental Asylum\n\nIt appears that the Idiot Asylum/Cottages has largely functioned independently from the main Asylum/Mental Hospital at Kew. The Cottages maintained its own record keeping system for the majority of its patient records, and it has always been listed as a separate agency, rather than a ward of Kew, in the Lists of Public Servants. However it probably relied on the main Asylum for some administrative support. Patients at the Cottages are included in the Annual Examination Registers and the Post Mortem Registers of the main Asylum for example. Therefore the exact relationship between the main Asylum and the Cottages has been difficult to define.\n\nLegislation\n\nLunacy Statute 1867\nLunacy Act 1888\nLunacy Act 1890\nLunacy Act 1903\nLunacy Act 1915\nLunacy Act 1928\nMental Hygiene Act 1933\nMental Health Act 1959\nHealth Commission Act 1977\nIntellectually Disabled Persons' Service Act 1986\nDisability Services Act 1991\nDisability Act 2006"

    "description": "Development and Services\n\nThe exact date of establishment of the Northcote Inebriate Asylum is unknown. A notice appeared in the Victoria Government Gazette in July 1890 which announced that the Northcote Inebriate Asylum was open for a limited number of female patients who were unable to contribute towards their maintenance. Conceivably, however, it may have only been open to those who could contribute to their own maintenance prior to this date. Records in custody at the Public Record Office date from 1890 so this would seem to suggest that the agency commenced in that year. A formal gazettal establishing the agency has not been found.\n\nAccording to C.R.D. Brothers in his book Early Victorian Psychiatry the Northcote Inebriate Asylum opened in 1873 as a \"semi-\" venture under the direction of Dr Charles McCarthy. He financed the institution through donations from citizens and this fund was supplemented by a Government grant. The Asylum was situated in St George's Road Northcote. The Asylum (or Retreat) was established as a result of the Inebriate Act 1872 (No.449). This Act repealed the 17th section of the Lunacy Statute 1867 (No.309) which had empowered the Master-in-Lunacy to commit inebriates to an asylum for any period up to twelve months. This new institution was to be specifically for the care and treatment of inebriates. However the asylum was not successful as the majority of inebriates could not afford to pay the maintenance fees Dr McCarthy demanded.\n\nAfter the Zox Commission into Asylums into 1888 all asylums were abolished under the provisions of the Inebriate Asylums Act 1888 (No.1009). This act also provide for the establishment of public inebriate asylums. The Northcote Inebriate Retreat was taken over by the Government in 1890 and became the \"Asylum for Inebriates at Northcote\" under the provisions of the Inebriates Act 1890, s.4. This may account for the notice in the Government Gazette mentioned above and the commencement date of records in the custody of the Public Record Office.\n\nTo be committed to be an inebriate asylum inebriates could make applications to the Master-in-Lunacy or to any Judge of the County or to a Police Magistrate or to any Justice. If that person was satisfied that the applicant had habitually used excessive quantities of intoxicating drinks and was sober at the time of the application and fully understood the nature of the application, the justice could make an order for his/her reception, detention and curative treatment for any term not exceeding three months.\n\nIf a person was certified by two medical practitioners as an inebriate the Master-in-Lunacy, Judge or Police Magistrate could order their apprehension.\n\nThe Northcote Inebriate Asylum was closed in October 1892 by order of the Governor-in-Council as published in the Victoria Government Gazette under the provisions of the Inebriates Act 1890, s.4.\n\nLegislation\n\nLunacy Statute 1867, s.17\nInebriates Act 1872\nInebriates Asylums Act 1888\nInebriates Act 1890\n\nLocation of Records\n\nSome records are held.

In line with the changeover to the care of emotionally disturbed children the institution became known as Travancore Psychiatric Developmental Centre.

    "description": "Administration of Mental Health prior to the Hospitals for the Insane Branch\n\nPrior to 1848 lunatics within the Port Phillip District were either detained in gaols or transferred to the Tarban Creek Lunatic Asylum in New South Wales. In 1848 the first permanent institution for the detention of lunatics within the Port Phillip District was established as a ward of the Tarban Creek Asylum. However, despite the establishment of this institution at Yarra Bend, the authorities continued to use gaols as places of internment for people who had been certified as \"dangerous lunatics\" or \"dangerous idiots\".\n\nFollowing the establishment of Victoria as a separate colony in 1851, the Colonial Secretary (VRG 16) became responsible for the Yarra Bend Lunatic Asylum (VA 2839) until 1855 when responsibility was assumed by the Chief Secretary (VRG 26). Until at least 1856 the Chief Medical Officer (previously the Colonial Surgeon) was responsible for the Asylum and there is some evidence to suggest that this relationship continued until 1861, from which time the Superintendent of the Asylum was directly responsible to the Chief Secretary.\n\nEstablishment of the Hospitals for the Insane Branch\n\nThe Hospitals for the Insane Branch has been dated from the appointment of an Inspector of Lunatic Asylums and Licensed Houses on 1 October 1867 under the provisions of the Lunacy Statute 1867 (No.309). On the same date the following institutions were proclaimed as public asylums: Yarra Bend Asylum (VA 2839) Collingwood Receiving Hospital (VA 2851) and the Royal Park Temporary Lunatic Asylum (all previously existing institutions) and the Ararat Asylum (VA 2841) and Beechworth Asylum (VA 2842) (both of which were newly established institutions).\n\nInstitutions\n\nA distinction was apparently made between an asylum and a receiving hospital the latter being intended for the reception of patients prior to diagnosis and possible long term committal to an asylum. The Act also provided for the establishment of lunacy wards in public hospitals and for the registration of privately run institutions to be known as licensed houses. The Act authorised the admission of inebriates to an asylum or licensed house for any period not exceeding twelve months. Subsequent legislation in 1872 provided for the establishment of separate licensed houses for the treatment and cure of inebriates. These institutions were to be known as retreats. Following the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Asylums for the Insane and Inebriate in 1886, a separate asylum for \"idiot children\" was established as the Idiot Ward at Kew Asylum (VA 2852) and an Asylum for the Criminally Insane was established as \"J Ward\" of the Ararat Asylum (VA 2841).\n\nThe Lunacy Act Amendment Act 1888 (No.986) provided for the proclamation of receiving houses for the short term detention of patients and licensed houses were to be phased out. In 1889 and 1890 two government controlled inebriate retreats were established at Beaconsfield and Northcote.\n\nAdministration of Mental Health\n\nThe Inspector of Lunatic Asylums and Licensed Houses was head of the Hospitals for the Insane Branch. Until the late 1880's this officer was also the Superintendent of one of the Lunatic Asylums. The Inspector was required to visit each institution at least once in every three months and to report on the condition of the institution and the treatment of patients. The Inspector was also empowered to authorise visits by relatives or medical personnel and the transfer of patients to the care of a relative or friend and to recommend the discharge of patients. Only the Chief Secretary could authorise the transfer of patients from one asylum to another and all discharges required the consent of the Chief Secretary.\n\nThe Hospitals for the Insane Branch was essentially responsible for the care, control and detention of lunatics, inebriates and the criminally insane and for the administration of lunatic asylums and licensed houses. Although the Branch was located within the Chief Secretary's Department (VA 475), it operated with a considerable degree of autonomy. The Inspector of Lunatic Asylums reported directly to the Chief Secretary and appears to have exercised effective authority in matters of policy and the operation of institutions.\n\nAlthough the Under-Secretary of the Chief Secretary's Department was the permanent head and thus had responsibility for those officers employed within the Civil and later the Public Service, the Inspector of Lunatic Asylums made recommendations regarding the appointment and supervision of personnel. Many decisions however also required the approval of the Public Service Commissioner.\n\nThe inefficiencies of such an arrangement were frequently criticized and in 1905, with the proclamation of the Lunacy Act 1903 (No.1873), the powers of the Public Service Commissioner were vested in the newly appointed Inspector General of the Insane who thus assumed the powers of permanent head in relation to the officers and employees of the newly established Lunacy Department (VA 2864). The Hospitals for the Insane Branch and the position of Inspector of Lunatic Asylums were thus effectively abolished.\n\nFor an account of the administration of mental health in Victoria from 1836 to 1989, see VRG 39 Health.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nResearchers are advised to consult the following groups: VRG 8 Health and Welfare Agencies, VRG 9 Prisons and Youth Training Centres and VRG 26 Chief Secretary, and the following sections of the List of Holdings 2nd edition 1985: 3.11.2 (Hospitals for the Insane Branch), 3.16.5 (Chief Secretary's Office), 3.4.7(Penal and Gaols Branch), 8.0.0.

    "description": "Establishment\n\nThe Lunacy Department (located in the Chief Secretary's Department (VA 475)) was established in 1905 under the provisions of the Lunacy Act 1903 (No.1873). This Department was the main agency responsible for the care, control and treatment of persons who were deemed to be lunatics, idiots (later mental defectives) inebriates or criminally insane and of persons suffering a mental disorder arising from war service. The Department was also responsible for the administration of hospitals for the insane and licensed houses.\n\nPrior to the establishment of the Lunacy Department, the Hospitals for the Insane Branch (Chief Secretary's Department) (VA 2863) had been the agency responsible for these functions and the chief administrative officer had been the Inspector of Lunatic Asylums and Licensed Houses.\n\nInstitutions\n\nUnder the provisions of the Lunacy Act 1903, public asylums became known as hospitals for the insane and the change of name reflected the change in emphasis from detention and custody to treatment and rehabilitation that had been evolving since the mid-nineteenth century. Hospitals for the insane were for the care and control of long term patients. The Act also provided for the establishment of receiving houses to which patients were to be admitted for observation, diagnosis and short term treatment. Lunacy wards in public hospitals became receiving wards and were for the temporary reception of insane persons or persons presumed to be insane. The Act also authorised the proclamation of separate institutions for the criminally insane and the licensing of ly run institutions known as licensed houses. The Inebriates Act 1904 (No.1940) authorised the reintroduction of a system of licensed premises for the reception, control and treatment of inebriates.\n\nIn 1887 a separate institution for the care of intellectually disabled children had been established as the Idiot Asylum (VA 2852) - a ward of Kew Asylum. In 1933 Travancore (VA 2861) a special school for \" the reception of children who, although mentally defective, are capable of receiving benefit from special instruction\" was established (See Annual Report 1933).\n\nUnder the provisions of the Mental Treatment Act 1915 and subsequent legislation a Convalescent Military Hospital was established at Mont Park in 1915 and a Military Mental Hospital was subsequently established at Bundoora. These and similar institutions and special wards were for the treatment of ex service personnel who were suffering from a mental disorder arising from war service. The Lunacy Department was responsible for these patients by agreement with the Commonwealth.\n\nCentral Administration of Mental Health\n\nPrior to the proclamation of the Lunacy Act 1903, the Inspector of Lunatic Asylums and Licensed Houses and others had frequently been critical of the divided authority in the administration of the Hospitals for the Insane Branch,-the Inspector, the Under-Secretary of the Chief Secretary's Department (VA 475) and the Public Service Commissioner each having some responsibility for its administration.\n\nThe Lunacy Act 1903 placed the authority firmly in the hands of the Inspector General of the Insane who was head of the Lunacy Department. The powers of the Public Service Commissioner were vested in the Inspector General of the Insane who thus assumed the powers of permanent head in relation to the officers and employees of the Lunacy Department. The Inspector General also reported directly to the Chief Secretary and thence to Parliament. The Inspector General was not a member of the Public Service but the Public Service Lists continue to place the staff of the Lunacy Department within the Chief Secretary's Department since these officers were members of the Public Service for whom the Chief Secretary had ministerial responsibility.\n\nGiven the degree of autonomy and the powers assigned to the Inspector General, it has been decided that the Chief Secretary's Department (VA 475) should not be cited as a superior agency for the Lunacy Department. However, given that the Chief Secretary retained ministerial responsibility for mental health, it is likely that records relating to the administration of this function will be found within the records of the Chief Secretary's Department (VA 475).\n\nIn 1934 with the proclamation of the Mental Hygiene Act 1933 (No.4157) the Department of Mental Hygiene (VA 2865) assumed the responsibilities of the Lunacy Department and the powers of the Inspector General of the Insane were assumed by the Director of Mental Hygiene.\n\nFor an account of the administration of Mental Health in Victoria from 1836 to 1989 see VRG 39 Health.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nResearchers are advised to consult the following groups: VRG 8 Health and Welfare Agencies, VRG 9 Prisons and Youth Training Centres and VRG 26 Chief Secretary, and the following sections of the List of Holdings 2nd edition 1985: 3.11.2 (Lunacy Department), 3.16.5 (Chief Secretary's Office), 3.4.7 (Penal and Gaols Branch), 8.0.0.

Under the provisions of this legislation the titles of mental health agencies were altered to reflect changing community attitudes towards mental illness and new approaches to the treatment of the mentally disturbed. The Lunacy Department (VA 2864) became known as the Department of Mental Hygiene; the Inspector-General of the Insane became the Director of Mental Hygiene; hospitals for the insane became known as mental hospitals and licensed houses became mental homes.\n\nThe Department of Mental Hygiene was located within the Chief Secretary's Department (VA 475) as its predecessor had been. The Director of Mental Hygiene assumed the powers and responsibilities of the Inspector General of the Insane, as established by the provisions of the Lunacy Act 1928 (No.3721). The Director thus assumed the powers of the Public Service Commissioner in relation to the officers and employees of the Department of Mental Hygiene. The Director exercised the powers of permanent head in relation to these employees and reported directly to the Chief Secretary and thence to Parliament. Given the powers assigned to the Director of Mental Hygiene, it has been decided that the Chief Secretary's Department (VA 475) should not be cited as a superior agency for the Department of Mental Hygiene for the period 1934 to 1940.\n\nHowever in 1940, under the provisions of the Public Service Act (No.4751) the Director of Mental Hygiene ceased to exercise the powers of the Public Service Commissioner in relation to the officers and employees of the Department of Mental Hygiene. The Public Service Commissioner had been replaced by the Public Service Board (VA 886) and the permanent officers of the Department elected one member of the Board who sat whenever matters concerning officers of the Department of Mental Hygiene were being considered. The Director retained certain powers in relation to disciplinary and other matters but no longer exercised all the powers of permanent head. Consequently the Chief Secretary's Department (VA 475) has been cited as a superior agency for the period 1940 - 1944.\n\nGiven that the Chief Secretary had ministerial responsibility for mental health from 1855 to 1944, it is likely that records relating to the administration of this function will be found within the records of the Chief Secretary's Department (VA 475).\n\nBy 1937, two branches had been established within the Department of Mental Hygiene. The Mental Defectives Branch was responsible for the care of retarded children and adults, while the Mental Hygiene Branch was responsible for the treatment of the mentally ill.\n\nInstitutions\n\nUnder the provisions of the Lunacy Act 1928 (No.3721) and the Mental Hygiene Act (No.4157) and related legislation a variety of institutions had been established for the care and treatment of the mentally ill, mental defectives and inebriates and for those suffering a mental disorder consequent upon their war service.\n\nInstitutions for the long term treatment of patients suffering from chronic mental illness were known as mental hospitals. Hospitals for the short term assessment, diagnosis and treatment of people suffering from acute mental illness were known as receiving houses and special wards within public hospitals were known as receiving wards. Places for the care of ex-service personnel suffering from war related mental illness were known as mental treatment institutions. ly run institutions (or licensed houses) for the care of the mentally ill were to be known as mental homes from 1934. Separate institutions for the criminally insane such as \"J Ward\" Ararat were known as hospitals for the criminally insane.\n\nThe Mental Deficiency Act 1939 (No.4703) provided for the establishment of state institutions for the care of mental defectives and retarded children and for the licensing of ly run institutions. In 1932 a special school, staffed by teachers seconded from the Education Department (VA 714) had been opened at Kew Childrens Cottages (VA 2852) previously the Idiot Ward of Kew Asylum. In 1933 Travancore (VA 2861) had been established for \"the reception of children who, although mentally defective, are capable of receiving benefit from special instruction\". (See Annual Report 1933.) In 1937, Janefield (VA 2847) was opened to provide accommodation and educational instruction for the severely retarded.\n\nThe Director of Mental Hygiene was also responsible for those ly run premises which had been licensed for the reception, control and treatment of inebriates, later known as alcoholics.\n\nAbolition\n\nThe Department of Mental Hygiene was effectively abolished under the provisions of the Ministry of Health Act 1943 (No.4988). In 1944 following the proclamation of this Act and a major re-organisation and amalgamation of the administration of health services, including mental health services, the responsibilities of the Department of Mental Hygiene were assumed by the Mental Hygiene Branch (VA 2866) of the newly established Department of Health I (VA 695).\n\nFor an account of the administration of mental health in Victoria from 1836 to 1989, see VRG 39 Health.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nResearchers are advised to consult VRG 8 Health and Welfare Agencies, VRG 26 Chief Secretary and VRG 9 Prisons and Youth Training centres.\n\nResearchers should also consult the following sections of the List of Holdings 2nd edition 1985: 3.11.2.

    "description": "Establishment\n\nThe Mental Hygiene Branch, Department of Health I was established in 1944 following the proclamation of the Ministry of Health Act 1943 (No.4988). This Act provided for a major reorganisation and amalgamation of the administration of health services in Victoria. Responsibility for the administration of the Mental Hygiene Acts and the Mental Deficiency Act 1939 (No.4703) was transferred from the Chief Secretary (VRG 26) to the Minister of Health (VRG 39) and the Mental Hygiene Branch was established as a division of the newly established Department of Health I (VA 695).\n\nThe Mental Hygiene Branch assumed responsibility for those functions previously administered by the Department of Mental Hygiene (VA 2865) which had been located within the Chief Secretary's Department (VA 475). The Branch thus became responsible for the development and direction of policy governing the treatment of the mentally ill, the care of the mentally retarded and the care and treatment of alcoholics and drug dependent persons and for the establishment and administration of institutions for their care. The establishment of the Branch also represented a continuing change in community attitudes towards mental illness and intellectual disability and led to a significant expansion of services for these people.\n\nAdministration\n\nThe Branch appears to have functioned quite autonomously within the Department of Health I (VA 695). The Director of Mental Hygiene, as principal officer, formulated mental health policy and was responsible for the administration of all functions provided for by the Mental Hygiene Acts. However, for the purposes of the Public Service Act the Secretary of the Department of Health I (VA 695) was ultimately responsible for the Branch. This was not to deprive the Director of the Branch of direct access to the Minister for the purpose of making representations on matters affecting the Mental Hygiene Branch (S.6(4)). Thus the Director reported directly to the Minister (see Annual Reports 1944-1949) but the officers of the Branch and the staff of all government mental institutions were subject to the authority of the Public Service Board (VA 886). Approval for any construction, maintenance or repair work undertaken by the Branch had to be obtained from the Public Works Department (VA 669).\n\nIn 1947 the Government established the Mental Hospitals Inquiry Committee, whose terms of reference included a review of the control of the Branch. Subsequently in 1952, under the provisions of the Mental Hygiene Authority Act 1950 (No.5519) the Director of Mental Hygiene was replaced by the Mental Hygiene Authority (VA 2838).\n\nThis Authority was reconstituted as the Mental Health Authority (VA 692) in 1962 under the provisions of the Mental Health Act 1959 (No.6605). The Authority was responsible for policy relating to mental health and control of the Mental Hygiene Branch. Between 1944 and 1978 the Mental Hygiene Branch greatly increased its services to patients and the public with the establishment of several clinics and childrens' facilities. It adopted a policy of regionalisation of facilities for the retarded and mentally ill, providing local accommodation in a less institutionalised environment.\n\nThe Chief Medical Officer of the Branch was given the statutory powers of the Director of Mental Hygiene in relation to admission, transfer, trial leave and discharge of patients and was also responsible for the physical well being of patients generally. The Chief Clinical Officer of the Branch was responsible for the treatment of mental disorders, research and staff training in the Branch.\n\nFunctions\n\nActivities of the Branch between 1944 and 1978 included:\n\n(a) provision of adult, child and adolescent psychiatric services through a comprehensive range of programmes including:\n\n\\* psychiatric hospitals for short term acute patients\n\\* mental hospitals for long term patients\n\\* out patient consultations at hospitals and clinics\n\\* day hospital facilities at hospitals and clinics\n\\* Personal Emergency Advisory Service\n\\* community psychiatric services.\n\n(b) provision of adult and child forensic services\n(c) programmes relating to undergraduate and post graduate training in psychiatry, the training of psychiatric nurses and other professional staff and mental health research based at the Mental Health Research Institute.\n\nThe Health Commission Act 1977 (No.9023) abolished the Mental Hygiene Branch and the Mental Health Authority and responsibility for the functions of both agencies was transferred to the newly constituted Health Commission of Victoria (VA 652) in which a Mental Health Division (VA 696) was established.\n\nFor an account of the administration of mental health in Victoria from 1836 to 1989, see VRG 39 Health.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nResearchers are advised to consult VRG 39 Health for agencies which created records relating to the central administration of mental health and VRG 8 Health and Welfare Agencies for institutions administered by the Mental Hygiene Branch, Department of Health I (VA 2866).\n\nResearchers should also consult the following sections of the List of Holdings 2nd edition, 1985: 3.11.2.

    "description": "The Municipal Conference on Tuberculosis was convened by the Collingwood municipal council in June 1908. A circular letter was sent by the Council to metropolitan municipalities inviting them to attend a meeting to \"consider the best means of dealing with tuberculosis and of assisting the incurables suffering from the disease\".\n\nUnder the provisions of the Health Act 1889 and subsequent legislation, municipalities were authorised to execute and enforce certain public health functions such as the control and prevention of infectious and contagious diseases. (see VRG 12 Municipalities and VRG 39 Health for a more detailed account of the administration of the public health function).\n\nMunicipalities were empowered under the Act to establish hospitals alone or to combine with other municipalities and could seek a reimbursement of fifty percent of their costs from consolidated revenue.\n\nThe first meeting of the conference was held on 29 June 1908. The Mayor of Collingwood was appointed to the chair and the Collingwood Town Clerk was appointed honorary secretary. Delegates from the undermentioned municipalities were present:\n\nBrunswick; Essendon;\nCollingwood; Malvern;\nFitzroy; Northcote;\nFoostcray; Port Melbourne;\nHawthorne; Williamstown;\nMelbourne; Kew;\nPrahran; Braybrook;\nRichmond; Bulla;\nSouth Melbourne; Dandenong;\nSt. Kilda; Eltham;\nBrighton; Ferntree Gully;\nCamberwell; Healesville;\nCaulfield; Heidelberg;\nLilydale; Moorabbin;\nPreston; Nunawading.\n\nAt the second meeting on 23 July 1908 a Sub-Committee consisting of nine municipal councillors and three members of the Health Association was formed to draft a scheme for \"dealing with consumptives and to report to the conference at a future meeting\". The Sub-Committee made its report on 2 October 1908 and recommended the provision of suitable accommodation for consumptives in order to prevent the spread of tuberculosis.\n\nThe conference continued to meet until 1910 when the scheme for the establishment of a hospital for advanced cases of consumptives proposed by the Government was accepted by the conference delegates. The conference appears to have met for the last time on the 9 March 1910."

    "title": "Liquor Licensing Commission",
    "description": "Establishment\n\nThe Liquor Licensing Commission came into operation as the successor to the Liquor Control Commission on 3 May 1988. Unlike the previous agency it was not a quasi-judicial body but represented a less formal approach to the control of the sale, supply, and consumption of liquor.\n\nThe Liquor Licensing Commission resulted from an enquiry commissioned by the State Government in 1984. On 10 October 1984 Dr J.P. Nieuwenhuysen began a comprehensive review of the Liquor Control Act 1968 (No.7695). The report was completed on 31 January 1986 and comments were invited. The general thrust of the report was that the Act under which the licensing laws of Victoria were administered was outdated and cumbersome. New social and economic developments associated with liquor licensing had been restricted by the antiquated nature of the law.\n\nThree basic changes in liquor policy were suggested:\n - greater use of instruments outside and within a licensing Act, especially tailored to counter problems of alcohol misuse,\n - a less economically and otherwise intrusive and overlapping licensing Act, with greater flexibility for the business of licence holders,\n - administrative reform of liquor licensing and a clear separation of judicial and administrative functions.\n\nIn 1987 the Liquor Control Act was passed and incorporated many of the report's recommendations.\n\nThe object of the Act was to respond to community interest by:\n\n - promoting economic and social growth in Victoria by encouraging the proper development of the liquor, hospitality and related industries,\n - facilitating the development of a diversity of licensed facilities reflecting consumer demand,\n - providing adequate controls over the sale, disposal and consumption of liquor,\n - contributing to the effective co-ordination of the efforts of government and non-government agencies in the prevention and control of alcohol abuse and misuse.\n\nThe Act provided that the new Commission should consist of a Commissioner, a Deputy Commissioner, (both of whom must be legal practitioners of not less than five years standing) and one or more Assistant Commissioners. The legislation also made provision for the appointment of a Chief Executive Officer (s.35), a Registrar and licensing fund assessors and other officers and employees as might be necessary (s.45).\n\nFunctions\n\nThe Commission is required to receive, process, and grant or refuse applications for new licences or permits, transfers of existing licences, suspension or cancellation of a licence or permit, extended hours permits, consideration of objections to licence applications through preliminary conferences and, failing resolution, through determinations following hearings.\n\nIt is the role of the Commission to :\n\n - assess and collect licensing fees,\n - under the Planning and Environment Act 1987 to act as a referral authority with respect to any question that arises under a planning scheme relating to premises where a liquor licence may be sought,\n - to disseminate information regarding the operation of the Liquor Control Act to prospective applicants and the general public.\n\nThe primary function of the members of the Commission is to make decisions in accordance with the Act on applications put before them and to act as the referral authority under the Planning and Environment Act. The administration is the joint responsibility of the Chief Executive Officer and the Registrar.\n\nIn 1998 the Liquor Licensing Commission was abolished and replaced by the Director of Liquor Licensing within the Department of State and Regional Development."

    "title": "Licensing Courts",
    "description": "General Annual Licensing Meetings\n\nFrom the time of first permanent settlement in Victoria licences authorising the sale and supply of liquor were granted by justices of the peace at Annual General Licensing Meetings held in June every year. Following the English tradition of heavy control and excise of the licensing trade, over 40 Acts and Statutes were passed by the Victorian legislature between 1852 and the turn of the century.\n\nThe Act 3 Wm IV, No.8 (June 1833) provided for a General Meeting of the justices acting in and for each district in the Colony to be held in June each year and to be called the General Annual Licensing Meeting for the special purpose of considering all applications for licences for public houses. Three justices at least were required to be present. The justices were empowered to grant certificates authorising the issue of a licence. These certificates and the fee were then required to be lodged with the office of the Collector of Internal Revenue (Colonial Treasurer, New South Wales) who upon receipt would issue and register the licences.\n\nThe Act also established Special General Sessions of the justices for the transferring of licences. All offences under the Act were to be heard at Courts of Quarter Sessions.\n\nThe Act 8 Wm IV, No.8 (1837) provided for the application of the 1833 legislation in the newly established Port Phillip District and empowered an officer, to be appointed by the Governor-in-Council, to issue publicans licences in lieu of the Colonial Treasurer in Sydney. The first officer authorised to do so was the Police Magistrate, Port Phillip District, William Lonsdale in September 1837. However by 1839 the Sub-Treasurer had been appointed to issue licences for the Port Phillip District.\n\nThe Act regulating the sale and supply of liquor in the Port Phillip District at time of separation in 1851 was 13 Vic.,No.29 (1849). This Act did not substantially alter the liquor licensing law, continuing the system of General Annual Licensing Meetings within each district for the hearing of applications for licences but allowing for a bench of two justices of the peace when a third was unavailable.\n\nThe Act provided for three types of licences, a publican's general licence, a packet licence (ship) and a confectioner's licence. The latter licence was confined to the sale of spruce beer and ginger beer. An 1854 Act 17 Vic.,No.24 provided for the registration of spirit merchants. Act 25 Vic.,No.147 (1862) introduced a requirement for distiller's licences, wine grower's and brewer's licences.\n\nLicensing Benches in Courts of Petty Sessions\n\nIn 1864, all then existing statutes were repealed and replaced by the Wines, Beer and Spirits Sale Act 1864 27 Vic.,No.227 which first introduced the single bottle or grocer's licence to be held only by a spirit merchant.\n\nThis Act abolished the General Annual Licensing Meetings and provided for the granting and transferring of licences to be a judicial proceeding within any sitting of the Court of Petty Sessions within a district.\n\nUnder the provisions of the Wines, Beers and Spirits Sale Act 1870 (34Vic.,No.390) the power to grant licences to be issued under the Act within each district was restricted to a Licensing Bench composed of a stipendiary magistrate and two other justices of the peace, nominated by the majority of and from amongst the justices resident within each licensing district. All applications for the granting, renewal, transfer or forfeiture of licences were to be heard by these appointed magistrates.\n\nQuarterly licensing meetings were to be held at each of the courts of petty sessions within a licensing district each year. Magistrate's were bound to give a months notice of the licensing meetings in the Government Gazette.\n\nThe Act also allowed a municipal body to object to the granting of a licence in a district where there were already a sufficient number of licensed premises. The Act provided that on such an objection a poll should be taken in the neighbourhood, introducing for the first time the concept of the reduction of liquor licences.\n\nLicensing Courts were also supported, from 1876, by Inspectors of Liquor whose job it was to maintain the standard of liquor sold to the public and to ensure that it was unadulterated and fit for consumption. The position was apparently joined with that of Inspectors of Distilleries (Licensed Premises) and operated within the Trade and Customs area as part of the excise and customs function. In the years 1900 to 1901 when the customs function passed to the Commonwealth (VRG 87) the Inspectors of Liquor were placed under the authority of the Minister of Public Health (VRG 39). The function has apparently remained with the Health portfolio and although there are no Inspectors of Liquor as such post c1978 the duties may possibly still be undertaken as part of the general health investigations area.\n\nDistrict Licensing Courts\n\nThe Licensing Act 1885 (40 Vic.,No.857) replaced the previous Licensing Benches with a separate Licensing Court for each licensing district to be constituted by three police magistrates except in the districts of Melbourne, Geelong and Sandhurst (Bendigo) where the chairman of the court was to be a County Court Judge. The Act also subjected licensed premises to the control and supervision of a Licensing Inspector who was empowered both to inspect premises and to give such reports and make orders as would ensure the maintenance of standards. Licensing Inspectors were appointed from the police force by the Governor.\n\nThe Licensing Court would send duplicates of all certificates for licenses granted to the Treasurer, who continued to register and issue all liquor licenses. All fees, fines, penalties and forfeitures were to be paid to the Treasurer to be placed in a trust fund called the Licensing Act 1885 Fund which was to be applied to the carrying out of the provisions of the Act.\n\nThe Licensing Courts had jurisdiction over all matters relating to:\n\n the granting or refusal of all applications for licences to be issued under the provisions of the Act\n the revocation, forfeiture, or cancellation of such licences\n the imposition of penalties authorised by the Act\n hearings of appeals from inspector's orders\n the disqualification of licensed persons and premises.\n\nThe 1870 legislation empowered the licensing magistrate to approve or refuse all applications for entertainment licences for licensed premises and required the magistrate to forward lists of all applications to the agency responsible, the Chief Secretary's Department (VA 475).\n\nLiquor Licence Reduction\n\nProvision for the containment and reduction of licences was also introduced in the 1885 legislation. No licences could be granted in a district where the statutory number had been exceeded and where this occurred reduction could be effected by a local option poll. Compensation was to be paid to the owners and licensees of closed hotels out of a compensation fund, entitled the Licensing Fund, revenue for which was derived from fees and fines. Under these provisions 168 local option polls were held at varying intervals. However the system was found to be unwieldy, uncertain and expensive, and so in 1906 the Licences Reduction Board (VA 2906) was constituted to centrally administer this function.\n\nFrom 1890 onwards the Clerk (in charge) of the Chief Secretary's Department (VA 475) had charge of the business connected with the administration of the Licensing Act.\n\nThe district court system for the administration of licensing matters continued until 1916 when the Licensing Court of Victoria (VA 2955) was constituted.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nSignificant records are in Public Record Office custody, including long runs of Licensing Registers. For records of individual district licensing courts, see also List of Holdings 2nd edition 1985, sections 2.8.0. to 2.256.0 (geographical groupings of courts).

    "description": "Appointment of Victorian Railways Commissioners\n\nOn 1 November 1883 assent was given to the Victorian Railways Commissioners Act 1883, 47 Vic.,No.767, to make better provision for the construction, maintenance and management of the state railways. Although the provisions concerning the appointment of Commissioners were given immediate effect, the remaining provisions of the Act were not to become operative until 1st February 1884. The Act provided for the transfer of statutory responsibility for the state's railways from the Board of Land and Works (VA 744) to the newly appointed Victorian Railways Commissioners. The Commissioners, constituted as a statutory body, were to report directly to the minister responsible for railways and could appoint staff to assist in the execution of the Act. The staff of the Department of Railways (VA 2965) thereafter became subject to the authority of the Commissioners and became commonly known as 'Victorian Railways' (although this title had been used interchangeably with Department of Railways since the first appointment of staff in 1856). It is not evident that any major changes were made to the Department's operation as a result of this rearrangement. However a new agency, VA 2876, has been registered from 1883, incorporating the Victorian Railways Commissioners 1883-1973 and the Victorian Railways Board 1973-1983.\n\nRailway Management and Construction\n\nThe functions for which Victorian Railways assumed responsibility included:\n survey and construction of new lines of railway\n supervision and maintenance of existing lines\n management of railway traffic including passengers, goods and livestock\n superintendence of railway services\n determining by-laws, rules and regulations concerning railway operations\n construction and repair of rolling stock.\n\nThe Railways Act (Amendment Act) 1891, 55 Vic.,No.1250, provided for the Board of Land and Works (VA 744) to resume responsibility for the survey, construction and completion of all lines of railway, while the Victorian Railways Commissioners retained responsibility for the supervision and maintenance of all completed lines. Operational responsibility for railway construction was taken on by the Board's Railway Construction Branch (VA 690). Under the provisions of the Act the Minister responsible for Railways was also deemed to be, ex officio, a Vice-President of the Board of Land and Works - a return to the situation which had existed until 1884 when the Board had ceased to have any responsibility for railways matters. The Act also provided for the establishment of a Railway Accident Fund.\n\nAssociated Functions\n\nFrom 1888 the Victorian Railways gradually began to take on a role in tourism which developed into the operation of the Victorian Government Tourist Bureaux.\n\nIn 1911 the Victorian Railways Commissioners assumed responsibility for the State Coal Mine (VA 720) from the Mines Department (VA 612).\n\nWithin Victorian Railways other functions developed including:\n operation of electric supply for street tramway services 1906-1959\n operation of Newport Power Station A (from c1921 until 1951)\n provision of railway refreshment services (from 1920)\n management of Mt Buffalo Chalet (from 1924-1983)\n provision of road motor services for passengers (from 1925)\n provision of motor transport services for goods\n operation of Newport Power Station B (until 1939).\n\nHandover of Associated Functions to Other Agencies\n\nIn 1939 and 1951, responsibility for the operation of the Newport Power Stations B and A respectively was assumed by the State Electricity Commission (VA 1002). In 1959 the management of the Government Tourist Bureaux passed to the Tourism Development Authority (VA 2918). For a brief account of the administration of tourism functions from 1888 to the present see VRG 91 Tourism III.

    "description": "Formation of Department of Railways I 1858\n\nThe first Department of Railways emerged in January 1858, subject to the statutory control of the Board of Land and Works (VA 744). Prior to this, railways matters, which essentially involved the survey of proposed lines of railway, were administered by a Railways Branch of the Surveyor-General's Department (VA 2921) which from November 1857 became a Branch of the Department of Crown Lands and Survey (VA 538).\n\nThe establishment of a Department of Railways reflected the Government's increased responsibility under legislation for the co-ordination and development of the State's railways.\n\nFunctions\n\nIn particular the Main Trunk Line Act 1857 (21 Vic., No.35) authorized the State to construct main trunk lines of railway from Melbourne to the Murray River and from Geelong to Ballarat. The Railway Loan Act 1857 (21 Vic., No.36) authorized the raising of money by debentures for the construction of certain railways. The Railway Act 1857 (21 Vic., No.38) provided for the general construction of railways within the State. The Railway Supervision Act 1857 (21 Vic., No.40) authorized the State's Railway Authority to inspect and supervise the operations of railway companies for the protection of railway passengers.\n\nAlso, in the Acts incorporating the various joint stock railway companies provision was made for the Government to purchase the rights and property of the company after a certain time period.\n\nRole of Board of Land and Works (VA 744)\n\nAlthough the legislation vested the Board of Land and Works (VA 744) with responsibility for administering the State's railways, functional responsibility effectively rested with the Department of Railways. The Board of Land and Works' statutory responsibility involved deciding matters of dispute and policy matters, making regulations, and generally authorizing the business and finances of the Department.\n\nWhen the Board of Land and Works met to determine railway matters the Vice-President of the Board presided. Initially there was only one Vice-President who was also the Commissioner of Public Works. However on 23 January 1862, the Commissioner of Railways and Roads was appointed as a second Vice-President of the Board, and thereafter presided over railway matters.\n\nMinisterial Responsibility\n\nLikewise, the Commissioner of Public Works was the Minister responsible for railway matters until the Commissioners of Railways, and later, Commissioners of Railways and Roads were subsequently appointed. By 1870 the Government had purchased most of the railway companies and vested responsibility for their rights and property with the Board and hence the Department.\n\nEmergence of Combined Department of Railways and Roads 1871\n\nAlthough there had been a Commissioner of Railways and Roads since December 1861 it is evident that a combined Department of Railways and Roads did not exist until circa April 1871. The Department of Railways and Roads (VA 2875) assumed all functions previously undertaken by the Department of Railways 1.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nSee List of Holdings 2nd edition 1985, section 3.21.0."

Powlett was appointed Chief Commissioner of Crown Lands and head of the Crown Lands Department. The Department assumed responsibility for the management and sale of crown land and the Chief Commissioner of Crown Lands was responsible for co-ordinating and supervising the work of the Commissioners of Crown Lands who had previously been responsible to the Colonial Secretary.\n\nThe Crown Lands Department was responsible for the administration of all matters relating to the alienation and occupation of crown land including the sale of crown lands by auction; the granting of sites as reserves for public purposes such as schools, churches and cemeteries; the issue of Deeds of Grant for lands sold and for reserves; consideration of applications for occupation licences, tenders for pastoral runs, applications for permission to exercise a pre-emptive right to purchase part of a pastoral run; the payment of licence fees and the prevention of unauthorized occupation of crown lands.\n\nFor further information about the responsibilities of Commissioners of Crown Lands see VRG 27, District Land Offices.\n\nThe administrative unit under the control of the Chief Commissioner of Crown Lands was known by a number of other titles including Crown Lands Office, Department of Crown Lands and Department of the Chief Commissioner of Crown Lands. Until the achievement of responsible government in 1855, the entire business of the colony was conducted either directly or indirectly through the Colonial Secretary's Office (VA 856) and the head of the Crown Lands Department was thus responsible to the Colonial Secretary. Although the Crown Lands Department did not become directly responsible to the Surveyor General until his appointment to the Ministry in 1855, the Department has been placed in the Lands record group (VRG 18) from its establishment in 1853 because the administration of the lands functions for which it was responsible can be clearly differentiated from this time.\n\nAmalgamation under Board of Land and Works\n\nIn 1857 the Board of Land and Works (VA 744) was established because it was considered that the administration of public lands and public works could be more effectually and economically managed if responsibility for these matters was consolidated. The Crown Lands Department was effectively amalgamated with the Surveyor General's Department (VA 2921) to form the Department of Crown Lands and Survey (VA 538) which was a sub department of the Board of Land and Works.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nAlthough the PRO has substantial holdings of lands records for the period 1851-1904 many records remain out of custody.\n\nFor records of the Crown Lands Department, see also the List of Holdings 2nd edition 1985, section 3.6.2 (Land Branch to Department of Crown Lands and Survey) and section 4.0.0 (District Land offices)."

    "description": "Establishment\n\nThe Ministry for Economic Development was established under the provisions of the Economic Development Act 1981 (No.9567) and was deemed to have been operative from March 1981. During the period 1981 to 1983 many changes were made in the administration of functions associated with economic and regional development and tourism. During the first half of 1981, the Ministry for Economic Development gradually assumed responsibility for functions previously administered by the Department of State Development, Decentralisation and Tourism (VA 2881), though this agency was not formally abolished until July 1981.\n\nThus for a brief period in 1981, prior to the establishment of the Ministry of Tourism II (VA 2879), the Ministry for Economic Development was responsible for all aspects of the promotion and development of tourism in Victoria.\n\nEconomic and Regional Development\n\nThe Ministry was primarily responsible for economic and regional development in Victoria with particular emphasis on decentralisation and industrial development. Its responsibility, as defined by the Act, was to facilitate, encourage and promote activities which would lead to:\n\n the balanced economic development of the State\n the development of industries and business undertakings throughout the State with particular regard to decentralised industries and business undertakings\n the development of the export capacity of industry\n the development of advanced technology industry\n\nThe Ministry conducted research to assist the development and establishment of export oriented and advanced technology industry and negotiated with statutory authorities to facilitate the provision of utility services required for industries and business undertakings.\n\nThe Ministry was also responsible for regional development including the promotion and development of industrial, commercial and other business undertakings and employment opportunities with particular emphasis on the Albury/Wodonga and Geelong regions.\n\nThe Ministry carried out these functions in conjunction with other authorities such as the Victorian Economic Development Corporation (VA 1109), the Small Business Development Corporation, the Albury-Wodonga (Victoria) Corporation and the Geelong Regional Commission (VA 426).\n\nTourism\n\nFor the brief period that the Ministry was responsible for tourism functions it reported to the Minister for Tourism II (VRG 89) in the administration of these duties and the positions of Minister for Economic Development and Minister for Tourism were held by the same person until December 1982.\n\nThe Ministry was empowered under the Act to facilitate encourage, promote and carry out, either separately or in conjunction with the Victorian Government Travel Authority (VA 2990), the development of the tourist industry throughout the State, including the promotion of the tourist industry.\n\nFurther research is required to fully document the nature of the relationship between these two agencies especially in the area of the promotion of the tourist industry.\n\nNOTE: For a brief account of the administration of tourism between 1888 and 1987 see VRG 91 Tourism III.\n\nLiquor Licensing\n\nIn 1983 the Minister for Economic Development assumed responsibility for the administration of liquor control and licensing from the Minister of Tourism (VRG 89). The major authority involved was the Liquor Control Commission (VA 1110).\nNOTE: See VRG 82 Industry, Technology and Resources for more information about liquor licensing.\n\nAbolition\n\nIn November 1983 responsibility for all functions previously administered by the Ministry for Economic Development was transferred to the Department of Industry, Commerce and Technology.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nSome departmental records have been transferred. For records relating to liquor licensing, see VA 1110.\n\nSee also List of Holdings 2nd edition 1985, section 3.13.4."

It is therefore possible that records relating to immigration matters may be located within the central administrative records of this Department, which has also been included in the Immigration and Ethnic Affairs Group for the years 1978 to 1981. For a history of the immigration function, see VRG 68 Immigration and Ethnic Affairs.\n\nTourism\n\nTourism functions administered by the Division of Tourism within the Department included:\n\n developing and promoting the tourist industry in Victoria\n establishing and improving tourist facilities in Victoria\n assisting persons and organisations interested in the development of the tourist industry\n promoting publicity and research assisting any of the above.\n\nThe promotion and improvement of tourist facilities was facilitated through the Department's allocation of subsidies and loans from the Tourist Fund to local municipal authorities, government organisations and bodies.\n\nVictorian Government Tourist Bureaux\n\nUnder the Authority contained in the State Development Act (No.8081) the Department (VA 2881) operated and administered the five Victorian Government Tourist Bureaux in Victoria and those located in Adelaide, Sydney and Brisbane. Following the repeal of that legislation although there was no specific power in the State Development, Decentralisation and Tourism Act (No.9126) 1978 to operate tourist bureaux, the Department (VA 2881) continued tourist bureaux operations, under the general powers of the Minister, pursuant to section 7 of the latter Act.\n\nHowever from 1 July 1978 the Victorian Government Travel Authority (VA 2990) commenced operation with responsibility for the management of the tourist bureaux under the powers contained in the Victorian Government Travel Authority Act 1977 (No.9083).\n\nDuring 1979 responsibility for the general publicity and promotion of tourist facilities and attractions in Victoria was transferred from the Department of State Development, Decentralisation and Tourism (VA 2881) to the Authority (VA 2990).\n\nFor a brief account of the administration of tourism between 1888 and 1987 see VRG 91 Tourism III.\n\nAbolition\n\nDuring the first half of 1981 the remaining functions of the Department of State Development, Decentralisation and Tourism were gradually assumed by the Ministry for Economic Development (VA 2880) and the Act which established the Department was formally repealed with effect from 1 July 1981.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nSome departmental records have been transferred.\n\nSee also List of Holdings 2nd edition 1985, sections 13.3.4.

From September 1948, the State Government assumed responsibility for the administration of price control in Victoria.\n\nA Prices Decontrol Commissioner was appointed under the provisions of the Prices Regulation Act, 1948. The Commissioner was appointed by the Governor in Council and was not subject to the provisions of the Public Service Act. Under the provisions of the Prices Regulation (Amendment) Act 1951 the Commissioner became known as the Prices Commissioner. The Prices Regulation Act also provided for the appointment of additional officers to administer price control in Victoria. A Prices Control Branch (also known as the Victorian Prices Branch) was established and located within the Law Department (VA 864).\n\nThe Prices Regulation Act was to be administered with a view to ensuring:\n\n the prevention of undue increases in prices and rates for goods, services and land, particularly food, clothing and housing during the period of post-war readjustment\n the regulation of prices and rates for goods and services regarded as essential or which were in short supply\n the progressive removal of price control\n\nThe Commissioner had the power to determine maximum prices and rates for declared goods and services.

    "description": "Formation\n\nFollowing the proclamation of Transfer of Land Statute on 1 August 1866, 29 Vic., No.301, the Office of Titles was established to carry out the provisions of the Act which further amended the Real Property Act 1862, 25 Vic., No.140. Under the provisions of the latter act a major reform in the transfer and registration of land titles had been instituted. The new system was colloquially known as the Torrens System. All functions previously administered by the Commissioner of Titles Office (VA 2926) were transferred to the Office of Titles (Victoria), and the positions of Examiner of Titles (who were also solicitors) and Registrar of Titles were created.\n\nOrganisation\n\nThe Office was divided into two branches, with the Professional Branch under the control of the Commissioner of Titles and the non-professional Branch under the control of the Registrar of Titles (Blue Book 1866, p.28 of Civil Establishment section).\n\nFunctions\n\nWithin the Office of Titles, the Commissioner had legal responsibility for proving land titles on receipt of the Examiner's report and for liaising with applicants and solicitors. The Registrar of Titles had the power to take statutory declarations, correct errors in registration, lodge caveats on behalf of the government or individuals when necessary and apply to the Supreme Court to issue a summons to anyone considered to have wrongfully gained title to land.\n\nFunctions of the Office of Titles also included the registration of all land under the Act whether Crown, public or and land set aside for easements and sub-division plans. Provision was made in the Act for land alienated prior to 2 October 1862 to be registered also. Under the Act, the Office of Titles exercised power in relation to such matters as land mortgages, insolvent estates, the placement of caveats on land titles, powers of attorney and married women and widows' entitlement to land. The Office was also responsible for guaranteeing and issuing titles and leases, providing sworn valuations and collecting conveyancing and search fees.\n\nBy July 1873 a new agency, the Office of the Registrar-General and Office of Titles (VA 862), had assumed responsibility for the functions previously undertaken separately by the Registrar-General's Department (VA 2889) and the Office of Titles, both of which had been located within the Law Department (VA 2825). The Registrar-General became the Chief Officer of the new agency which remained within the Law Department.\n\nNOTE: For more detail about the \"Torrens System\", see VA 862.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nSee also List of Holdings 2nd edition 1985, section 3.18.2"

    "title": "Registrar-General's Department",
    "description": "Introduction of Compulsory Registration of Births, Deaths and Marriages 1853\n\nIn 1853, a Registrar-General's Department was established under the provisions of the Births, Deaths and Marriages Act 16 Vic., No.26, (1853) with the introduction of compulsory registration of all births, deaths and marriages. A Chief Registrar, who reported to the Colonial Secretary (VRG 16) and later to the Chief Secretary (VRG 26), was appointed and had responsibility for the Deputy-Registrars who were assigned to various districts throughout Victoria for the purpose of registering all births, deaths and marriages. The Department was also responsible for indexing, searching for, and issuing birth, death and marriage certificates.\n\nCensus and Statistics\n\nThe Registrar-General's Department was gradually expanded. In 1854 functions previously carried out by the Statistics Branch of the Colonial Secretary's Office (VA 856) were transferred to the Department. These functions included responsibility for the collection of statistics by the Deputy-Registrars (a task previously carried out by the police) and the compilation of the 'Blue Books' containing statistical and other information on all government activities, expenditure and employees.\n\nOther related responsibilities included periodic census taking, preparation of statistics for Parliament, Government and its agencies, the sending out and lodging of annual returns for Friendly Societies and the holding in custody of documents under the Companies Act.\n\nRegistrar of the Supreme Court\n\nFurther expansion of the Department occurred in January 1858 when the responsibilities of the Registrar of the Supreme Court were combined with those of the Registrar-General, the latter assuming both titles in 1859. This additional function included the registration and management of land transfer documents, the issuing of deeds and the signing of all documents requiring legal verification.\n\nOther Registration Functions\n\nOfficers of the department also became responsible for performing civil marriages and the registration of the clergy following the proclamation of the Marriage Law Consolidation Act 22 Vic., No.71 in 1859.\n\nBy 1859, through the district Deputy-Registrars, the Department also had responsibility for registering public vaccinations, providing the necessary forms and, until 1859, supplying the vaccine to the medical officers performing this task. The latter responsibility was transferred to the Chief Medical Officer in the Chief Secretary's Department (VA 457).\n\nUnder the provisions of the Justices of the Peace Acts and the Coroners Acts, coroners were required to forward inquest depositions to the Crown Prosecutor. From 1853 and the proclamation of An Act for Registering Births Deaths and Marriages in the Colony of Victoria 16 Vic., No.26, coroners were required to inform the Chief Registrar of the particulars of deaths and the findings of the jury or the opinion of the magistrate as to the cause of death in those cases where an Inquest or Magisterial Enquiry was held.\n\nIn 1856, following correspondence between the Chief Registrar and the Attorney General concerning the obligations of coroners to provide information, the Attorney General advised the Chief Registrar that depositions in cases of inquests would, in future, be forwarded to that office as soon as it had been ascertained that they were no longer required for the administration of justice. (See register of legal opinions in the custody of the Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages.)\n\nThe practice of forwarding inquest depositions to the Registrar-General continued until 1988 when the State Coroner's Office (VA 2807) assumed responsibility for all coronial records.\n\nSome of the many diverse functions of the Registrar-General's Department included registering or collecting returns for livestock, licence liens on agricultural land, naturalizations, hospitals, banks, companies, patents, printing presses and types, powers of attorney and Parliamentary electors.\n\nLand Titles Registration\n\nA major reform in the transfer and registration of land titles, colloquially known as the 'Torrens System', came into effect in October 1862 with the proclamation of the Real Property Act 25 Vic., No.140. The Act made provision for the appointment of an Assistant Registrar-General and Lands Titles Commissioners. A Solicitor was also appointed to advise and assist in carrying out the provisions of the Act which dealt with all types of land transactions and registration under the new system. A Real Property Branch was established within the Registrar-General's Department to carry out the provisions of the Act. However, under the provisions of the Real Property Amendment Act 27 Vic., No.180 (1863), the Solicitor became known as the 'Commissioner of Titles' and assumed the powers previously exercised by the Lands Titles Commissioners together with the judicial functions and powers previously conferred on the Registrar-General under the Real Property Act 1862. In 1864, The Real Property Branch and its staff were transferred and absorbed into a Commissioner of Titles Office (VA 2926) in the Law Department (VA 2825), and an Assistant Registrar-General was appointed to the Office.\n\nPatents and Copyright\n\nIn 1865, all the powers and functions concerning the registration of patents previously undertaken by the Chief Secretary's Department (VA 475) were transferred to the Registrar-General's Department under the Patents Statute 36 Vic., No.432 (1865). In 1869 following the passing of the Copyright Act 33 Vic., No.350 which made provision for an Office of Copyright Registry, the Registrar-General's Department assumed responsibility for the registration of copyright.\n\nTransfer from Chief Secretary (VRG 26) to Law (VRG 19)\n\nIn 1869, responsibility for the administration of the Registrar-General's Department was transferred to the Law Department (VA 2825), and in 1873 the Department was amalgamated with the Office of Titles (VA 2888) to become the Office of the Registrar-General and Office of Titles (VA 862).\n\nLocation of Records\n\nSignificant records of inquests and early statistical returns are held at the Public Record Office. See also List of Holdings 2nd Edition 1985, section 3.4.12 (company registration), 3.18.2 (inquests, wills, statistics, land transaction registration records) and 3.18.3 (statistics, births, deaths and marriages)."

    "description": "On 30 June 1868 the Legislative Council (VA 471) appointed a Select Committee to investigate the question of altering and amending the Constitution. The Committee consisted of ten members.\n\nIn a report dated 19 July 1868 the Committee indicated that it wished to seek the co-operation of the Legislative Assembly (VA 2585) in considering the Constitution and to form a Joint Committee of both Houses. On August 20 a message was transmitted to the Assembly and on September 15 the Legislative Assembly reported that it had declined the invitation, the reason being that the process proposed was not a method usually adopted for amendment of legislation.\n\nMeanwhile the Committee appointed by the Legislative Council had been considering a Bill to alter the Qualifications of Electors and Members of the Legislative Council and had set forth an amended Bill for consideration.\n\nIt was not until nearly ten years later that this issue re-emerged. The Legislative Council had submitted two Bills - one re the composition of the Council and a second re the Constitution - to the Assembly after they had been passed by the Council. The Assembly apparently ignored the Bills and the action initiated a contest which had been brewing between the two Houses for some time.\n\nBoth the Council and the Assembly established committees to consider the question of reform of the Constitution, and although there was not a joint committee the two separate committees had to confer.\n\nLocation of Records\n\n\\*\\* Special Access Conditions \\*\\*\n\nAlthough records transferred from this agency are available for public inspection, special access conditions apply. The records have been transferred to the Public Record Office on the understanding that they remain the property of the Parliament of Victoria. Parliamentary records are transferred on condition that all requests for access will be referred to the Clerk of the Legislative Council/Legislative Assembly as appropriate, for determination in each case.\n\nApplication to inspect the records should be made to the appropriate officer and written authorisation must be presented at Public Record Office Search Rooms before records can be made available for inspection."

    "title": "Executive Council",
    "description": "Constitution\n\nThe Executive Council is a body appointed under the Governor's Letters Patents and Royal Instructions. Since the introduction of responsible Government in 1855, the Executive Council has given effect to Cabinet (VA 2989) and ministerial decisions. Between 1851, when Victoria was separated from New South Wales, and 1855, the Council consisted of the Lieutenant Governor and appointed officials to provide him with advice (four in 1851, five in 1854 and six from 22 May 1855).\n\nThe Victorian Constitution Act 1855 required at least four of the then seven principal officers of Government to be members of Parliament (section XVIII). This provision was replaced by the Officials in Parliament Act 1859, the original basis of the current provision in the Victorian Constitution Act 1975 (No.8750). Sections 50-51 of this Act provide that officers appointed by the Governor as responsible Ministers of the Governor shall also be members of the Executive Council and provisions for their appointment appears in the Letters Patent constituting the Office of Governor (VA 466).\n\nFunction\n\nThe Council, consisting of Executive Councillors under summons (namely, members of the current Ministry or Cabinet), usually meets weekly or as required. The quorum of three comprises the Governor and at least two Ministers. These meetings are of a formal nature and are presided over by the Governor or in his/her absence by his/her Deputy.\n\nWhere it is provided in the statutes that the Governor-in-Council may make proclamations, orders, regulations, appointments to public offices and so on, the Governor acts formally with the advice of the Executive Council, but actually in accordance with Cabinet or Ministerial decisions. (See also VA 466 Governor.)\n\nAdministrative Support\n\nAdministrative support to the Executive Council has been the responsibility of the Clerk of the Executive Council.\n\nFrom 1901 until 1911 the position of Clerk of the Executive Council was located within the Chief Secretary's Department (VA 475). From 1911 the Clerk of the Executive Council was required to perform the duties of the Official Secretary to the Governor. These duties continued to be jointly performed by the one officer until 1986.\n\nThe Official Secretary to the Governor/Clerk of the Executive Council was located within the Chief Secretary's Department (VA 475) until 1936 when the position was transferred to the Department of the Premier (VA 2717). From 1982 until 1986 the position was located within the Department of the Premier and Cabinet (VA 1039). In 1986 the responsibilities of the Official Secretary to the Governor were assumed by the former Secretary to the Governor (see VA 466 Governor's Office) and the Clerk of the Executive Council once again became a separate position.\n\nThe Clerk of the Executive Council is currently located within the Department of the Premier and Cabinet (VA 1039).\n\nAs it appears that the Chief Secretary and the Premier have had responsibility for personnel matters only the movement of the position between the departments has not been shown as a function transfer.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nSignificant holdings of Executive Council records are in the custody of the Public Record Office, including the Council's Minutes, 1851-1970.\n\nNOTE: Although the Clerk of the Executive Council has been located within the Departments of State of the Chief Secretary and the Premier since 1901 the records maintained by the Clerk have been attributed throughout to the Executive Council.\n\nSee also List of Holdings 2nd edition 1985, section 6.1.0."

    "title": "Department of Public Health",
    "description": "Until 1890 the central administration of public health had been the responsibility of the Central Board of Health which was located in the Chief Secretary's Department (VA 475).\n\nEstablishment of the Department of Public Health\n\nIn 1890 following a Royal Commission to Inquire into and report upon the Sanitary Condition of Melbourne (see Papers Presented to Parliament Volumes 2 and 4 1889 and Volume 2 1890) there were substantial changes to the administration of public health in Victoria. Following the proclamation of the Public Health Act 1889 (No.1044), the Chief Secretary, Alfred Deakin, was appointed Minister of Health (without salary) on 29 January 1890. The Central Board of Health was abolished and replaced by the Board of Public Health which was to be responsible for implementing the provisions of the Public Health Acts 1875-1889 and subsequent legislation. The Department of Public Health was responsible to the Board whose Chairman was the permanent head of the Department.\n\nFunctions associated with the administration of public health included:\n\n the control and prevention of infectious and contagious diseases\n quarantine\n establishing and enforcing standards of proper sanitation including waste disposal and collection and prevention of pollution\n regulation of offensive and dangerous trades\n establishing and enforcing standards for public buildings and dwelling houses and for the prevention of fires\n registration and control of boarding houses and other accommodation venues and of premises where food is consumed\n regulation of the preparation and sale of foods and medicines, including packaging and labelling standards\n supervision of abattoirs and milk production\n vaccination of children and infant welfare\n administration of municipal or district hospitals\n registration of hospitals\n care and treatment of patients suffering from tuberculosis or cancer\n registration of hairdressers, masseurs, tattooists, chiropodists, dietitians, plumbers and gasfitters\n cemeteries.\n\nBoard of Public Health/Department of Public Health\n\nThe Board of Public Health consisted of a Chairman, the Medical Inspector and seven representatives elected by the councils of municipal districts. Charles Alfred Topp was appointed Chairman of the Board from 31 January 1890. The Public Health Act also provided for the appointment of a medical inspector who was to be an expert in sanitary science and whose appointment was not subject to the provisions of the Public Service Act. The Act further authorised the appointment of \"an engineering inspector, a secretary and such other inspectors, health officers, clerks and officers as may be deemed necessary\", all of whom were to be members of the Public Service. Officers previously employed under the control of the Central Board of Health were transferred to the new Department of Public Health.\n\nExisting local boards of health were abolished and the powers, duties and liabilities previously vested in the boards were to be vested in and executed by the municipal councils. Officers, inspectors, analysts and staff of the local boards became employees of municipal councils. The Minister was empowered to require the Board and local authorities to make certain regulations and bylaws and the Board could require local councils to appoint health officers, inspectors and analysts.\n\nResponsibilities of the Department of Public Health\n\nThe Department of Public Health assumed responsibility for those functions previously administered by the officers of the Central Board of Health. These responsibilities had included the prevention, containment and treatment of infectious and contagious diseases; quarantine; hospitals for the reception of patients suffering from an infectious or contagious disease; the provision of medical aid to persons suffering from epidemic diseases; compulsory vaccination of children; the construction and maintenance of adequate drains and sewers; the regulation of noxious trades; the enforcement of proper standards of sanitation including waste disposal and collection; regulation of common lodging houses; prevention of pollution of the River Yarra; regulation of standards for public buildings; administration of local municipal hospitals; infant life protection and prevention of the adulteration of food, drink and medical drugs.\n\nThe Public Health Act 1889 included further provisions regarding the administration of these functions. The Act also enabled the Chairman, at the direction of the Board, to establish hospitals where local authorities failed to do so and the Board was empowered to recover its costs from the local councils. The Act further provided that councils which established district hospitals could seek reimbursement of fifty percent of their costs from consolidated revenue.\n\nThe Public Health Act 1889 empowered the Governor-in-Council to make regulations for the registration, inspection, drainage, good management and sanitary regulation of all hospitals and institutions which provided for the medical or surgical treatment or care of patients and which were not in receipt of aid from the State. The Board of Public Health and its officers in the Department were responsible for the enforcement of these regulations.\n\nThe Act also provided for the registration of plumbers and gasfitters by the Board of Public Health.\n\nEstablishment of Commission of Public Health 1920\n\nIn 1920, under the provisions of the Health Act 1919 (No.3041) the Board of Public Health was abolished and replaced by the Commission of Public Health (VA 694) which was to consist of seven members being the Chief Health Officer (formerly the Medical Inspector) who was to be chairman and six members to be appointed by the Governor-in-Council, of whom not more than two were to be medical practitioners and of whom three were to be representatives of metropolitan municipalities, non metropolitan cities, towns and boroughs and non metropolitan shires respectively.\n\nThe Commission was to be responsible for the promotion of public health and for the implementation and enforcement of the provisions of the Health Act. In addition to the public health responsibilities inherited from the Board of Public Health, the Commission was to promote the prevention and suppression of infectious and preventable diseases; to advise the Minister on matters of public health; to carry our research and investigations, publish reports and hold inquiries into matters concerning public health and the prevention and treatment of disease; to advise and assist councils in regard to matters affecting public health and to prepare model bylaws for adoption by councils.\n\nThe Act provided for the appointment of a Chief Health Officer who was to be the permanent head of the Department of Public Health (VA 2904) and for the appointment of District Health Officers who were to be responsible to the Commission. As with previous legislation responsibility for the administration of the Health Act was shared between the Commission, the Department of Public Health (VA 2904) and local authorities.\n\nCemeteries\n\nUnder the provisions of the Cemeteries Acts, trustees of public cemeteries were appointed by the Governor-in-Council. Trustees were responsible for the establishment and maintenance of public cemeteries and were empowered to determine rules and regulations for the management of cemeteries and a scale of fees, subject to the approval of the Governor-in-Council and publication in the Government Gazette.\n\nIn 1890, under the provisions of the Cemeteries Act 1890 (No.1072) and the Public Health Act 1889 (No.1044), the Department of Public Health became responsible for the administration of cemeteries, including the appointment of trustees.\n\nMajor Re-organisation of Health Services 1944\n\nIn 1890 when responsibility for public health was transferred to the Department of Public Health, responsibility for mental health had remained with the Chief Secretary's Department (VA 475). In 1944 with the proclamation of the Ministry of Health Act 1943 (No.4988) responsibility for all health services was transferred to the newly established Department of Health I (VA 695).\n\nNOTE: For further information about the administration of health services in Victoria from 1836 to 1989, see VRG 39 Health.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nThe records of the Department of Public Health in the custody of the PRO are far from complete and there are no records held for the period prior to 1920. Researchers are advised to consult the list below and the List of Holdings 2nd edition 1985, section 3.11.3. As municipal councils had a significant role in the administration of public health see also VRG 12 Municipalities and List of Holdings, section 10.0.0 (Municipalities).

    "description": "Establishment and Constitution\n\nThe Victorian Licensing Court came into operation on 30 June 1954. It was constituted under the Licensing Amendment Act 1953 (No.5767) and assumed the functions of the Licensing Court of Victoria (VA 2955).\n\nThe new Court was to be under the Chairmanship of a Judge of the County Court, the two other members being magistrates, with tenure extended from three to seven years (s.8).\n\nThe Act also made provision for the appointment of a Supervisor of Licenced Premises (s.11) who was aided by nine assistant supervisors. The duties of the office included examining and reporting upon the nature and extent of hotel accommodation for the public and the provision made for the supply of meals and refreshments in hotels; consulting with licensing inspectors on proposed plans for new licensed premises, or alterations and extensions to existing hotels and clubs and reporting to the Court re same; and generally assisting the Licensing Court (s.11.2-4). The new Supervisor's Department of the Victorian Licensing Court was staffed by members of the Police Force.\n\nFunctions\n\nThe Court had complete jurisdiction over the granting, transfer, cancellation and supervision of all liquor licences, with authority to impose penalties, hear evidence taken under oath and administer all related permits. Under the new legislation the functions of the Court were extended to include the control and supervision of \"sanitation, hygiene, ventilation, cooling, heating, fire prevention and the cleanliness of food in all licensed premises\".\n\nFor the purpose of reviewing licences annually the Licensing Court held Annual Sittings usually in November and December. Applications for renewal were made by all licensees, country licensees setting down their applications with the Licensing Clerk for that particular area. A magistrate held a sitting on the appointed day in the Court House at each of the prescribed centres.\n\nThe Court was not restricted as to the number of licences that it had the power to grant, the State having been constituted as one licensing district by the 1953 legislation (s.2). In the event of a cancellation of a licence the Court sat as the Licences Reduction Board (VA 2906) in order to fix compensation. This, and the acceptance of voluntary licence surrender were the only remaining functions of the Board until it's dissolution in 1968, when the Victorian Licensing Court was abolished and the Liquor Control Commission (VA 1110) assumed all the responsibilities associated with liquor licensing in Victoria.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nFor central records of the Victorian Licensing Court see list below.

    "title": "Licences Reduction Board",
    "description": "Establishment\n\nThe Licences Reduction Board, was appointed on 21 May 1907 for a period of ten years under the Licensing Act 1906 (No.2068). It carried on the function previously undertaken by the Licensing Courts (VA 2870) of overseeing the systematic and orderly reduction of hotel licences in Victoria. It is most probable that the Board reported to the Chief Secretary (VRG 26) for the first ten years, however this is not absolutely certain.\n\nThe Act also established a special Compensation Fund out of which compensation for licence deprivation and surrender, as well as the salaries and expenses of the three members and staff of the Board were to be paid (ss.42-43). The Fund was built up by annual contributions by licensees and owners in addition to their licence fee which went into the separate Licensing Fund.\n\nFunctions\n\nThe Board was to reduce the number of victuallers licences in Victoria by:\n\n assessing the maximum compensation allowable for loss of licence to owner and licensee\n determining which premises in each district should be closed\n determining the actual compensation payable to the owner and licensee.\n\nIn accordance with the objectives of the Act, when reducing licences in a district due regard had to be paid to the convenience of the public and the requirements of the several localities in the district .The Board was required to give priority to closing those hotels whose licensees had been convicted of breaches of the licensing legislation in the three years prior to the Act (s.44).\n\nThe Board could only reduce as many licences as could be compensated for by the funds available for that year (s.43) and no reductions were to be made in a district where the number of licences was below the statutory limit (s.49).\n\nThe Board was empowered by the Act to make a general survey of all hotels licensed before 1886 in Victoria and to determine the maximum compensation payable in the event of the licence being deprived (s.45). Records relating to this survey can be found in VPRS 7722/P1 Maximum Valuation Files.\n\nHearings were held within each licensing district to determine which hotels were to be deprived , after which sittings were held to determine compensation. Records relating to this process can be found in VPRS 7723/P1 Hotel Licence Deprivation and Surrender Files and VPRS 7605/P1 and P2 Minute Books of the Licences Reduction Board.\n\nIn these proceedings the Board had the powers of a court; it could summon witnesses, demand documents and hear evidence under oath. Failure to comply could incur prosecution before a Court of Petty Sessions (s.47). However there was no right of appeal, the determinations of the Board being final and conclusive (s.46).\n\nBetween 1907 and 1916 the Board closed 1054 hotels and a total of 540,851 pounds sterling was paid in compensation. At the termination of their period of office the Legislature re-appointed the members of the Board with increased jurisdiction.\n\nLocal Option Polls\n\nThe 1906 Act provided that after a ten year (reduction) period there should be triennial local option polls held in every district to determine whether further reductions should be effected. The first of these was due in 1917 but the 1916 Act postponed these polls until 1920 and provided that the Board should continue its work. The 1922 Act continued the polls but extended the interval to every 8 years. Polls were held in 1920, 1930, and 1938 before the provision was repealed in 1946. Two districts, Boroondara and Nunawading voted to have no hotels in the 1920 poll.\n\nCentralised administration proved successful and in 1916 the Licensing Act conferred upon the members of the Board the duty of exercising throughout Victoria the jurisdiction of licensing magistrates, previously a function of the Licensing Courts (VA 2870), now constituted as the Licensing Court of Victoria (2955) (s.35).\n\nFrom this time on the Board was constituted by three licensing magistrates, and the Secretary of the Board and all its employees were deemed to have been appointed the Registrar and officers of the Court under the Public Service Act (s.38-39). The special Compensation Fund was abolished and all compensation was paid out of the general Licensing Fund (s.44).\n\nAbolition\n\nThe Board continued in existence until the establishment of the Liquor Control Commission (VA 1110) in 1968. However its activities steadily decreased with changing attitudes to the sale and consumption of liquor in the community. In 1954 the Licensing Court of Victoria passed its functions to the Victorian Licensing Court (VA 2905), whose members would sit as the Licences Reduction Board for the fixing of compensation for cancelled licences. This and the acceptance of licence surrenders were the Board's only functions in the later years.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nSome related records are held by the Public Record Office. See also entries in the Summary Guide under VRG 4 Courts, VA 2870 Licensing Courts and VA 2905 Victorian Licensing Court, and the geographical groupings of Courts in the List of Holdings 2nd edition 1985, sections 2.8.0-2.256.0."

    "description": "The Ministry of Housing and Construction was established on 14 December 1987 to more efficiently manage the activities of the former Ministry of Housing (VA 609) and Public Works Department (VA 669). The new Ministry assumed all the functions of both these agencies.\n\nIn August 1988 responsibility for supply of furniture, stores and equipment and outfitting of government buildings was transferred to the Department of Property and Services (VA 430).\n\nIn January 1991 the public housing and public building functions were transferred to the newly created Department of Planning and Housing (VA 3013).\n\nAfter January 1991 the Ministry of Housing and Construction was made an associated administrative unit of the Department (from January 1991 known as Office of Housing, in March 1991 this was changed to Housing and Construction, Victoria). However in May 1992 Housing and Construction, Victoria was removed as an administrative unit of the Department and an administrative arrangements order formally transferred legislative responsibility to the Department of Planning and Housing. The end date of the agency has been identified from 1991 when it ceased to exist as a department of state.\n\nThe Ministry of Housing and Construction was responsible for:\n\nPublic Housing\n\nOver time this function has encompassed:\n\n from 1937 clearance of slum areas, improving existing housing, establishing minimum housing standards, providing public housing for persons with limited means and zoning areas for residential or other use.\n\n from 1945 administration of funding allocated to public housing under the terms of a Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement Act (No.5114) including the construction and management of large public housing estates.\n\n from the 1970s providing financial assistance and information to home buyers and renovators; managing housing assistance programmes including providing rental accommodation through the Government's rental housing programme, community-managed housing and rental.\n\nBackground\n\nA Slum Reclamation Abolition Board was appointed by Cabinet on 19 July 1936 to investigate housing in Victoria after concerns were expressed about the ability of many local municipalities to cope with increasing demands for housing associated with the establishment of large manufacturing industry. Subsequently the Housing Commission of Victoria was established by the Housing Act 1937. Following an initial investigation of housing conditions a further Act was passed in 1938, the Slum Reclamation and Housing Act. The two Acts defined the following main principles governing the operations of the Commission:\n\n improvement of existing housing conditions\n determination of minimum standards with which new houses must comply\n reclamation of insanitary areas\n provision of houses for persons of limited means\n zoning, i.e. the division of municipal districts into residential and other areas.\n\nFrom this early period until the 1970s emphasis was placed on clearing slum areas and re-housing people of limited means at the cheapest cost. From 1945 funding was provided for public housing under the Commonwealth State Housing Agreements and the Commission built large estates of public housing (houses, units and multi-storey flats) in cleared areas in the inner urban region and in undeveloped areas on the outskirts of Melbourne. A Concrete House Factory, known as the Holmesglen Concrete House Project, was established to facilitate the cheap mass production of prefabricated houses.\n\nThe first significant change in the Commission's functions resulted from the Housing Act 1943. This Act enabled the Commission to let or lease houses to persons of limited means who wished to purchase a home. The Housing Act 1953 widened the objectives and powers of the Commission to enable it to cope with the planning requirements of large estates.\n\nIn 1972 the Ministry of Housing was established and took over prime responsibility for the housing function which included:\n improving housing conditions\n providing adequate and suitable houses for letting or purchase to persons of limited means or living under unsatisfactory housing conditions\n co-ordinating the supply and renewal of public housing\n assisting in the provision of finance for persons building, purchasing or renovating houses.\n\nThe Housing Commission continued to be responsible for the following aspects of the housing function until it was abolished in 1983 :\n\n the Ministry's purchase and construction program,\n the allocation of housing funds,\n general tenancy arrangements\n house sales.\n\nDesign and Construction of Government Buildings\n\nThis function encompasses the programming, planning, and design and construction of works and buildings for state government departments, ministries and agencies.\n\nSupply of Furniture, Stores and Equipment\n\nThis function encompasses the supply of furniture, stores and equipment to government buildings.\n\nOutfitting of Government Buildings\n\nThis function encompasses the fitting out of government accommodation, maintenance of air-conditioning, and related survey and drafting functions for government constructions.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nFor records of this agency see list of series below."

    "title": "Victoria Promotion Committee",
    "description": "Establishment\n\nAfter representation had been made to the Victorian State Government and the Melbourne City Council, a Committee was formed to capitalise on the overseas tourism promotional opportunity for Melbourne and Victoria, generated by the Melbourne Olympic Games (November 1956).\n\nFunds were received from a group of anonymous Melbourne citizens (15000 pounds) and the State Government also contributed (35,000 Pounds). The first meeting was convened on the 13 March 1956 by the Victorian State Government and the Olympic Civic Committee, and a trust was formed to administer these funds.\n\nThe Deed of Trust was signed, sealed and delivered by the Trustees at the third meeting on 22 March 1956 (no copy found). It was resolved that the Trustees would operate as the Victoria Promotion Committee (V.P.C). Unlike most Trusts, the Committee was not established under a statute.\n\nThe Committee trustees included leading Victorian community and industrial leaders and various government department representatives. The Committee established a London V.P.C., which included the Agent General of Victoria as a member, and originally maintained representatives and later established offices in France, Germany, Italy, United States, Canada, and Japan.\n\nAdministrative Arrangements\n\nThe Committee, which came to be totally sponsored by the State Government through a Treasury Trust Fund with an annual grant, reported directly to the Premier on financial matters and appointment of Trustees. The Committee operated with a large degree of autonomy.\n\nInward Correspondence of the Department of the Premier, (VPRS 7614 P1, Unit244, Item 2380/1 & 2) suggest the Committee initially liaised and operated in close co-operation with the Division of State Development, within the Premier's Department, and upon its establishment in 1971, with the Department of State Development (VA 552), also known as Department of State Development and Decentralisation from 1972.\n\nThe extent of the relationship between the VPC and Department of State Development and Decentralisation is unclear. It would seem that with the above changes in 1972, budget responsibility were transferred to State Development and Decentralisation, although the VPC still reported directly to Premier. By 1974, after 18 months of discussions over role and reporting relationships, the two agencies agreed to interchange staff, to ensure rationalisation of activities and the continued co-operation and liaison between organisations.\n\nThe proclamation of State Development, Decentralisation and Tourism Act 1978 (No.9126) on the 23 May 1978 established The Department of State Development, Decentralisation and Tourism (VA 2881). This new Department assumed the functions and responsibilities of the previous Department, although the V.P.C. minutes makes no mention of the any further changes.\n\nAbolition\n\nThe Victoria Promotion Committee was abolished when the power and functions of the Committee were merged with those of the Victorian Development Corporation and vested in the Victorian Economic Development Corporation (V.E.D.C) (VA 1109). The V.E.D.C. was established under the Victorian Economic Development Corporation Act 1981 (No.9574), which became operational on 1 July 1981.\n\nResearchers should note that in part II, section 16 of the Victorian Economic Development Corporation Act 1981 (No.9574), it states that the V.P.C. was appointed under the State Development Decentralisation and Tourism Act 1978 (No.9126). No reference could be located within that Act nor the minutes to confirm this. However it does mention the appointment of Advisory Committees by the Minister, under which the Committee may have been appointed.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nVery few records of the Victoria Promotion Committee have been transferred to the Public Record Office, those in custody are listed below.\n\nFurther Sources\n\nKerr, Richard, Some Aspects of Overseas Investment in Victoria - a short history of V.P.C. 1956-1982 (held at the State Library of Victoria)\n\nVictoria Promotion Committee, A guide to investment; Victoria, Australia, produced every two years (held at the Victorian Government Interdepartmental Library)."

    "description": "Establishment\n\nFollowing separation of the Port Phillip District from New South Wales in 1851, a Surveyor General's Department was established within Victoria. Prior to separation, surveyors had received instructions from the Surveyor General's Department in NSW and had been employed within the Port Phillip Branch of that Department.\n\nThe Surveyor General's Department was administered by the Surveyor General who was also a member of the Legislative Council from 1851 to 1855 and a Minister from 1855 until 1857 when this position was replaced within the Ministry by a Commissioner of Crown Lands and Survey.\n\nSurvey\n\nThe Department included the Surveyor General's Office, surveyors within the Field Branch, a Deed Branch, draughtsmen and lithographers and was essentially responsible for the conduct of surveys, the preparation and publication of plans and the geological survey. For information about the responsibilities of District and Field Surveyors see VRG 27 District Land Offices.\n\nRailways\n\nThe appointment on 5 May 1856 of George Darbyshire as Engineer-in-Chief and Surveyor to 'Victorian Railways' marked the establishment of a sub-department of railways within the Surveyor General's Department. It was established within this Department because the prime function of 'Victorian Railways' was, at that time, the survey of proposed lines of railway.\n\nGuardian of Aborigines (VA 513)\n\nIn 1856 responsibility for the Guardian of Aborigines was transferred from the Chief Secretary (VRG 26) to the Surveyor-General (VRG 18). This responsibility was assumed by the Board of Land and Works (VA 744) on its establishment in 1857 and became part of the Department of Crown Lands and Survey (VA 538).\n\nAmalgamation under Board of Land and Works\n\nIn 1857 a Board of Land and Works (VA 744) was established because it was considered that the administration of public lands and public works could be more effectually and economically managed if responsibility for these matters was consolidated.\n\nThe Surveyor General's Department was effectively amalgamated with the Crown Lands Department (VA 2878) to form the Department of Crown Lands and Survey (VA 538) which was a sub-department of the Board of Land and Works.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nAlthough the PRO has substantial holdings of records many remain out of custody.\n\nFor records of the Surveyor General's Department, see also List of Holdings 2nd edition 1985, section 3.18.4.

The establishment of the Commission had been announced by his Excellency's Command Mr Henry E. Bolte (Premier of Victoria).\n\nThe Commissioner was to inquire into, report upon, and make recommendations concerning off-the-course betting with particular reference to-\n\n1.(a) What social evil or evils are associated with illegal off-the-course betting as now conducted in Victoria?\n\n(b) What is the financial extent of such betting annually?\n\n(c) What net amount of revenue would be likely to accrue to the State annually if-such betting was subjected to the State revenue laws now applicable to betting on licensed racecourses?\n\n(d) What measures, legislative or otherwise, are now provided to suppress such betting, to what extent are they effective, and what action, if any, can be taken to make any and which of such measures more effective?\n\n2. If off-the-course betting were made lawful in Victoria-\n\n(a) Would any and which of the evils associated with unlawful off-the- course betting be likely to be mitigated to any and what extent?\n\n(b) Would any and what new social evils not now existing in connexion with unlawful off-the-course betting be likely to be created? If so, would such evils be\n\n(i) more; or\n(ii)less-\ndetrimental to the general public interest than those now existing?\n\n(c) What additional net annual revenue would be likely to accrue to the State if such betting was subjected to the State revenue laws now applicable to betting on licensed racecourses?\n\n3. What method or methods of off-the-course betting could be adopted to institute a lawful system of such betting in Victoria, what are the advantages and disadvantages of each of such methods, and which method is best suited for adoption in Victoria?\n\n4.(a) What advantage of advantages would be likely to accrue to the general public interest from making off-the-course betting lawful in Victoria?\n\n(b) What disadvantage or disadvantages would be likely to be suffered by the general public interest from making off-the-course betting lawful in Victoria?\n\n5. Is it desirable in the general public interest of Victoria that off-the-course betting\nshould be made lawful and, if so, what are the principal considerations that make such action desirable?\n\nFor the purposes of these terms of reference, off-the-course betting means betting by way of wagering- elsewhere than on a licensed racecourse during the holding thereon of a race-meeting within the meaning of the Racing Act 1957- on the results of horse or trotting races run at such a race-meeting.\n\nThe Royal Commission report was tabled in Parliament on 27 February 1959. The 'Report of the Royal Commisioner Appointed to Inquire into Off-The-Course Betting together with Minutes of Evidence' was published in the Papers Presented to Parliament 1958/59, Vol. 2, No 30. pp.853-907."

Each of the persons holding office as a member of the Licences Reduction Board (VA 2906) was, under the Act, immediately deemed to have been appointed a Licensing Magistrate (s.35). Centralised administration was achieved with the appointment of the Secretary of the Licences Reduction Board as the Registrar of the new court.\n\nThe system of licensing inspectors was continued, the duties of inspecting premises and enforcing the provisions of the Act being undertaken by nominated members of the police force who were not to be below the rank of sub-inspector. An additional duty of the inspectors was to submit an annual report to the Court.\n\nHearings were held on a circuit basis in courts of petty sessions appointed by the Governor-in-Council as licensing courts to serve various licensing districts. Notification of the annual sittings of the courts and their location appeared in the Government Gazettes.\n\nThe clerks of such courts would undertake the role of Licensing Clerk and would administer all licensing business in the locality and report directly to the Registrar of the Licensing Court.\n\nPrior to the passing of the Licensing Amendment Act 1922 (No.3259) there were two hundred and seventeen licensing districts in Victoria each consisting of one division of an electoral district. However section six of the new legislation provided that an entire electoral district should be the licensing district, thereby reducing the number to sixty-five.\n\nFunctions\n\nThe Licensing Court had jurisdiction over all matters relating to:\n\n( the granting or refusal of all applications for licences to be issued under the provisions of the Act;\n( the revocation ,forfeiture, or cancellation of such licences;\n( the imposition of penalties authorised by the Act;\n( hearings of appeals from inspector's orders;\n( the disqualification of licensed persons and premises.\n\nThe 1922 Act also empowered the Court to approve plans and to order the provision of additional accommodation and improvements where it thought them desirable section fourteen.\n\nThe Court continued until 1953 when legislation made provision for the establishment of the Victorian Licensing Court (VA 2905) in 1954.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nRecords relating to the activities of the Court can be found in VPRS 7784/P1 Licensing Court Memoranda and in VPRS 7785 Memoranda, Castlemaine Licensing Court.

These included the introduction of 10 p.m. closing for hotels, the inauguration of theatre and cabaret licences and provision for the supply of liquor with a meal on unlicensed premises.\n\nThe Liquor Control Act 1968 also reflected the recommendations of the Commission. It provided for the establishment of a new, non-financial, licensing administration body, the liquor Control Commission and a complete change to Victorian licensing law.\n\nThe recommendation of the Commission regarding the care and rehabilitation of alcoholics and drug addicts resulted in the amendment of the Inebriates Act 1958 by the Alcoholics and Drug Dependent Persons Act 1968. Research into Victorian drinking habits and alcohol/drug education courses for schools were also initiated and funded as a result of the Commission's recommendations.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nSee below and List of Holdings n Edition 1985, section 14.0.0."

The report of the Board was submitted on the 31 October 1977 and published in the Parliamentary Papers in April 1978. 128 witnesses presented evidence, 263 exhibits were tendered and approximately 320 submissions made.\n\nThe recommendations of the Board encompassed sweeping changes to the licensing law, in particular that the objectives of s.3 of the Act should reflect a concern for the containment of health and nuisance problems arising from the consumption of liquor, and that licence types be streamlined. However many of the key recommendations were not implemented by the Government. In 1978 an amendment to the Act was passed, providing for the creation of a convention facility licence and the licensing of R.S.L. sub-branches but it was not till the mid 1980s that a series of amendments to the Liquor Control Act were initiated.\n\nThe Liquor Control Act 1987 (No.97) completely repealed the 1968 Act.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nSee below."

Terms of reference involved determining whether:\n\n the sale of packaged beer in sealed containers, bottles and cans at prices below those recommended by the Australian Hotels Association and the Retail Liquor Merchants Association of Australia was inconsistent with objectives set out in Section 3 of the Liquor Control Act 1968 (which generally protection, improvement and development of the liquor industry) and\n any action to be taken if such an inconsistency was demonstrated.\n\nThe Board was set up following the revocation of the Liquor Control (Orderly Marketing) Regulations 1975 on 25 May 1976 on the grounds that they contravened the powers conferred by the Liquor Control Act. The general purpose of the regulations was to empower the liquor Control Commission to fix the minimum price which packaged beer could be sold by licensed persons.\n\nThe Board comprised a sole member, Lancelot Stanley Brokenshire, a member of the Liquor Control Commission. Public Hearings were held on 21 days between 28 June and 21 July 1976 during which time evidence was heard from 46 witnesses and 49 exhibits were tendered. The report was submitted on 27 August 1976.\n\nThe Board concluded that the sale of discounted packaged beer was inconsistent with the objectives of the Act and was detrimental to members of the liquor industry. It was recommended that the Liquor Control Act be amended to allow the Liquor Control Commission to determine a fixed minimum retail price per single unit for packaged beer. This was subsequently achieved on 7 December 1976 with the passing of the Liquor Control (Orderly Marketing) Act 1976 which amended the Act through the addition of a new Section 11A.\n\nThe records of the Board of Inquiry have been registered as VPRS 7709.

    "description": "Formation of Department of Roads and Bridges 1858\n\nUnder the provisions of the Board of Land and Works Act 1857 21 Vic., No.31 the Central Roads Board (VA 2803) was disbanded on 1 January 1858 and the Board of Land and Works (VA 744) took over responsibility for main road construction and bridges. Local authorities continued to be responsible for local roads and bridges (see VRG 12 Municipalities).\n\nOperational responsibility for main roads and bridges was exercised by the newly formed Department of Roads and Bridges which operated as a sub-department of the Board of Land and Works.\n\nAdministrative Structure and Functions\n\nOffice Branch\n\nThis Branch was headed by a non-political Commissioner of Roads and Bridges who was a member of the Board of Land and Works and who had responsibility for the general management and control of the Department. The Commissioner would obtain information from district engineers and the public concerning the expediency of constructing particular roads or bridges and would prepare a scheme and estimates to be submitted to Cabinet.\n\nEngineering Branch\n\nThis Branch was headed by the Inspector-General of Roads who was responsible for determining the character of works to be executed, and for the execution by contract of all such construction and maintenance works. This officer had control over district Road Engineers who in conjunction with surveyors from the Department of Crown Lands and Survey (VA 538) would prepare plans and designs, take levels and mark out lines of roads.\n\nNOTE: The relationship between local government and the administration of roads and bridges needs to be clarified.\n\nRole of Board of Lands and Works\n\nThe Board of Land and Works (VA 744), vested with statutory responsibility for roads and bridges, accepted the contracts, approved and authorized the business and expenditure of the Department, and decided matters of difficulty and all matters of policy. The Board also assumed responsibility for regulating the collection of tolls.\n\nMinisterial Responsibility\n\nPrior to the establishment of the Board of Land and Works (VA 744), the Commissioner of Public Works was the Minister responsible for roads and bridges functions. Upon establishment, the President of the Board of Land and Works assumed responsibility for all powers previously vested in both the Commissioner of Public Works (VRG 28) and the Surveyor General (or Commissioner of Crown Lands and Survey - see VRG 18). It is apparent however that roads and bridges matters continued to be associated with Public Works functions until the Department of Roads and Bridges emerged in its own right in 1858 (see also VA 669). Between late 1858 and late 1861 the Commissioner of Crown Lands and Survey appears to have been the Minister responsible for roads and bridges. In December 1861 a Commissioner of Railways and Roads was appointed assuming responsibility for roads and bridges functions.\n\nMerging of Roads and Railways Administration 1871\n\nDespite there being a single Minister responsible for both railways and roads from 1861 it is evident that the Department of Railways (VA 2877) and the Department of Roads and Bridges existed quite independently, with separate administration, until 1871. On 26 April 1871 John Steavenson, who was the Assistant Commissioner of Roads and Bridges, was also appointed to the position of Secretary to the Railways Department and thereafter the two departments appear to have been jointly administered as the Department of Railways and Roads (VA 2875).\n\nLocation of Records\n\nSee List of Holdings 2nd edition 1985, section 3.19.0."

    "description": "Formation of Department of Railways II\n\nOn 1 September 1877, the Governor-in-Council removed the administration of matters relating to roads and bridges from the Department of Railways and Roads (VA 2875). Responsibility for railway matters was subsequently assumed by a second Department of Railways.\n\nOver the next few years significant internal administrative changes took place as responsible positions were created, abolished and revived in relatively short time periods.\n\nThe Department initially reported to the Commissioner of Railways and Roads until 5 March 1880, and thereafter to the Commissioner of Railways. By 1878 the government had purchased the Melbourne and Hobson's Bay United Railway Company - the last of the major railway companies - although it appears that minor railway lines could still be constructed ly.\n\nAdministrative Structure and Functions\n\nTo carry out its main functions of the survey, construction and maintenance of railway lines and the management of the State's railway service, the Department of Railways on 12 July 1882 consisted of the following branches:\n\n Administration Branch, responsible for the general supervision and administration of the whole of the railway service.\n\n Engineer-in-Chief's Branch, responsible for the supervision of the survey and construction of all lines.\n\n Engineer for Existing Lines Branch, responsible for the supervision and maintenance of all constructed railways.\n\n Traffic Branch, responsible for the management of railway traffic including passengers, goods and live-stock.\n\n Locomotive Branch, concerned with general railway practice and requirements.\n\n Telegraph Branch, responsible for the supervision of telegraph and signalling matters, clocks and watches.\n\nRole of Board of Land and Works (VA 744) and Victorian Railways Commissioners (VA 2876)\n\nAt all times the business of the Department was subject to the authority of the Board of Land and Works (VA 744). In 1884 the management of the State's railways was assumed by a statutory body known as the Victorian Railways Commissioners.\n\nThe Board of Land and Works thereafter effectively ceased to exercise responsibility for railways matters and it appears that the Minister responsible for Railways ceased to be, ex officio, a Vice-President of the Board.\n\nAlthough the functions of the Railway Department were not affected by this transfer of statutory responsibility the Department which existed under the direction of the Victorian Railway Commissioners has been registered as a separate agency: VA 2876 Victorian Railways.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nSee List of Holdings 2nd edition, 1985, section 3.21.0."

    "description": "Establishment and Scope of the Commission\n\nThe Royal Commission on Soldier Settlement was constituted under Letters Patent on 21 January 1925.\n\nSoldier Settlement was initiated under the Discharged Soldiers' Settlement Act 1917 (No.2916). The Government's intention was to repatriate ex-servicemen by providing them with the means whereby they could acquire farming land under favourable conditions. The scheme was administered by the agencies responsible for Closer Settlement, the Lands Purchase and Management Board (VA 2265) and subsequently the Closer Settlement Board (VA 2266). Closer settlement and soldier settlement on irrigable land was from 1913 until 1932 the responsibility of the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission (VA 723).\n\nThe scheme encountered many problems and the consequent loss to the settlers and the State was severe. The Government reacted by appointing this Royal Commission to investigate and report on the situation. In accordance with the terms of reference, the Commission was to assess the land set aside for soldier settlement, the provisions of the Discharged Soldier's Settlement Acts in relation to financial advances and the arrangements between the Commonwealth and the State for the settlement of the soldiers.\n\nThe Commissioners, James Turnbull, David Park, Thomas James McGaillard and Henry John Wiltshire made their report on 23 October, 1925.\n\nIn 1932, after various other Boards of Inquiry had looked at this and related issues, an Act was passed giving effect to recommendations made for the relief of settlers. The Closer Settlement Act 1932 (No.4091) established a Commission of five members to administer all closer settlement and soldier settlement. Provision was made for the consolidation into one debt of the liabilities of each settler at 30 June 1932. The Commission was also empowered to make adjustments to the annual payments made by settlers.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nSee list below."

Plans and specifications were to be endorsed by the Minister of Public Works.\n\nThe Councils delegated the authority conferred by the Order-in-Council of 4 May 1904 to Alfred Edward Morgans of Perth who subsequently transferred his interest to the North Melbourne Electric Tramways and Lighting Company Limited for a period of thirty years. Following the completion of the thirty years franchise the entire operation was to revert to the respective local councils.\n\nFunctions\n\nThe Company thus claimed to act under the authority of the Orders-in-Council and also under the authority of the Flemington Road Tramways Act 1911 (No.2333), which provided for the construction of a branch tramway that formed a part of the tramways mentioned in the Order-in-Council.

    "description": "Establishment\n\nThe Melbourne Tramway and Omnibus Company Limited (M.T. & O.C. Ltd) was registered under the Companies Statute, 1864 on 11 September 1877. A Board of five Directors was appointed and Francis Boardman Clapp was the first Managing Director of the Company.\n\nThe Company was established to make, work and maintain street and road tramways and to provide a safe and easy means of transit to and from the various suburbs and along the lines of the principal streets of the City of Melbourne. The Company was to manufacture and maintain omnibuses and tramway carriages for the purpose of its undertaking.\n\nThe Melbourne Tramway and Omnibus Company Limited purchased the property and assets of the Melbourne Omnibus Company Limited (1868-78) when the latter was liquidated in August 1878.\n\nIt is assumed that from that time the M.T. & O.C Ltd was responsible for the operation of the horse bus lines that had been established by the Melbourne Omnibus Company. The M.T. & O.C. Ltd extended its operations to other suburbs and by 1882 it had 470 employees and 1600 horses and 178 horse buses running on fifteen routes.\n\nTramway Operations\n\nIn May 1882 a Members Bill was introduced in Parliament with the purpose of authorising the M.T. & O.C. Ltd to construct and operate the Melbourne Tramways. Before it was passed a Municipal Conference in September 1882 decided that it would be better if the tramways were be constructed by a body representing interested municipalities and that the Company should operate the tramways under lease. The municipalities were disinclined to part with control of their streets to any body. The Bill was amended accordingly.\n\nThe Melbourne Tramways and Omnibus Company's Act (No.765) came into operation on 12 October 1883. The Act provided for the establishment of the Melbourne Tramways Trust. (See VA 2692 for more details). Under the provisions of this Act, the M.T. & O.C. Ltd was granted an exclusive franchise to operate cable tramways in and out of the City of Melbourne for thirty years. The contract was to expire in 1916. The Company was authorised to provide the rolling stock.\n\nUnder terms of the lease the Company procured land and built sixteen car houses and a repair shop and operated the trams during the whole term of its lease. While most of the original routes were replaced by the cable trams, the Company continued to run the horse buses on some lines in East Brunswick, Prahran and Malvern, on Dandenong Road, in Moonee Ponds, Kew and Hawthorn.\n\nFrom 1888 to 1891, the cable tramway grew rapidly. Cable lines had been extended to most of Melbourne's inner suburbs by the time the system was completed in 1891. The Richmond line was constructed by the Company and opened for traffic on 11 November 1885. The Company constructed this line as the agent of the Melbourne Tramways Trust (VA 2692), pending the floating of the Trust's first loan.\n\nIn 1888 the M.T. & O.C. Ltd was authorised to construct and operate the Royal Park Horse tramway under a lease provided for by the Zoological and Acclimatization Society Act 1888 (No.974). This tramway was not covered by the leasing arrangement with the Melbourne Tramway Trust.\n\nGrowing tension between the workers and the Company led to the appointment of a Royal Commission in 1898 to inquire into the industrial relations and practices of the M.T. & O.C. Ltd.\n\nAbolition\n\nOn the expiry of its lease on 30 June 1916, the M.T. & O.C. Ltd surrendered its authority to operate the city's cable network to the Melbourne Tramway Board, a government agency, (see VA 2693). The Company ceased to function as a passenger carrier from 1 July 1916. Under the provisions of the Tramway Board Act 1915, the employees of the Company and the Trust were transferred to the Tramway Board together with all property.\n\nFollowing the expiry of its lease the M.T. & O.C. Ltd demanded compensation for the loss of its assets. The case commenced in June 1916. Remaining company staff were fully occupied in preparing evidence for the arbitration case. There was a long delay in arriving at a settlement of the dispute between the company and the Melbourne Tramway Board. The dispute was finally resolved by a decision of the Supreme Court in 1919.\n\nAlthough the M.T. & O.C. Ltd ceased to operate the cable tramway system in 1916 it was not finally dissolved until July 1919.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nSome records of the Melbourne Tramway and Omnibus Company Limited have been transferred to the Public Record Office."

The Trust was to control, manage and operate the lines on completion.\n\nEnlargement of the Trust\n\nOn 11 July 1913, the Trust submitted to its constituent councils a scheme for further enlargement of the Trust. Following an agreement made with the constituent councils on 31 July 1914, the lines operated by the Trust on behalf of the councils were taken over as Trust lines with retrospective effect from 1 October 1913. The agreement also admitted to the Trust representatives from the Councils of Kew and Hawthorn.\n\nAn agreement was entered into between the Kew and Hawthorn Councils and the Trust by which the Trust agreed to reconstruct the Kew horse tramway as an electric tramway and to construct an extension from its terminus at the Booroondara Cemetery to Strathalbyn Street and to operate and manage the same as Trust lines on its completion.\n\nThe Council of the City of Camberwell became a constituent member of the Trust in 1915.\n\nDissolution of the Trust\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of the Melbourne and Metropolitan Tramways Act 1918 (No.2995), the Prahran and Malvern Tramways Trust was dissolved. The control of the undertaking passed on to the M. & M.T.B. on 20 February 1920.\n\n\nTramway lines opened\n\nThe construction of electric tramways by the Trust started on 20 October 1909.

    "description": "Establishment\n\nThe Victorian Government Major Projects Unit is responsible for the co-ordination of designated major development projects and for the preparation of strategic state owned sites for development by the sector.\n\nIt was established in February 1987 following the gazettal of the Administration of Acts, Supplement to General Order of 29 April 1986, dated 13 February 1987. Under the provisions of this order, the Premier assigned ministerial responsibility for so much of the Urban Land Authority Act 1979 (No.9320) as related to major state projects to the Minister for Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Evan Walker, in his capacity as the Minister Responsible for Major Projects.\n\nThe Urban Land Authority (VA 1358) delegated its powers relating to major state projects to the Unit under Section 8 of the Urban Land Authority Act (No.9320). The operations of the Unit are separate from the existing residential and commercial land development activities of the Urban Land Authority.\n\nOrganistation and Structure\n\nThe Major Projects Unit is responsible for major projects assigned to it by the Government. The modus operandi of the Unit is for the Government to formally assign responsibility for specified approved projects to the Unit. Any liabilities arising from Government approved activities are the responsibility of the State. The Minister responsible formally assigns responsibility in accordance with the Premier's order of 13 February 1987 and Section 4 (1) (c) of the Urban Land Authority Act (No.9320). Initially there were eight projects managed by the Unit, all of them important to the development of inner Melbourne. In 1989, there were thirteen projects reflecting the Government's determination to accelerate the development of government-owned land.\n\nThe Unit works closely with all the relevant government departments (Ministry of Planning and Environment, Ministry of Conservation, Forests and Lands and the Ministry of Transport). The Unit brings together people with management skills from a number of departments and agencies and uses the services of consultants and contractors. Recruitment is primarily through secondment and contract employment.\n\nEach project is headed by a Project Director, supported by a small project team assembled from the and public sectors. Project Directors report through the Director of the Unit to the Minister and are supported by a core staff which provides legal and financial expertise.\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of the Annual Reporting Act 1983, the annual report of the Unit is submitted to the Minister Responsible for Major Projects. The Minister, as chairman of the Special Committee for Major Projects, reports to the Economic Committee of the Cabinet.\n\nFunctions\n\nThe functions of the Unit include acquisition, consolidation and preparation of sites. Its task is to facilitate the development of large strategically significant areas of government-owned land for commercial, tourist and residential purposes. It is responsible for major state projects assigned to it by the Government. It provides a central contact point for developers interested in investing in major government projects.\n\nThe Unit has the authority to invite tenders, evaluate competitive development proposals, select developers, facilitate planning approvals, execute financial and legal agreements and supervise construction.\n\nSome of the projects managed by the Unit as at March 1989 were:\n\n Bayside\n Lynch's Bridge\n South Bank\n Prince Henry's Hospital\n Jolimont Railyards\n Willesmere Hospital Site\n World Congress Centre\n Redevelopment of the State Library\n Docklands (proposed Olympic Games Village)\n Queen Victoria Hospital\n Museum\n Old Treasury\n\nLocation of Records\n\nOnly a small quantity of records has so far been transferred to the Public Record Office."

The Corporation was established under the Transport (Amendment) Act 1989 (44/1989). The trading name Vic Roads is used to identify the Roads Corporation.\n\nFunctions\n\nThe functions of the Roads Corporation, as set out in the Act, are essentially those carried out by its two previous agencies. The main functions are:\n\n- to maintain, upgrade and extend the State's road network\n- in conjunction with municipalities, to assist in the maintenance, upgrading and construction of other roads\n- to design, construct and maintain traffic signals and other traffic facilities for the purposes of traffic management\n- to determine load limits and speed limits\n- to provide and maintain roadside reserves\n- to establish guidelines and requirements for the issue of vehicle mass and dimension permits\n- to provide registration and licensing procedures associated with road transport\n- to develop and implement road safety strategies and road safety education programs\n- to develop and implement traffic management strategies\n- to specify and promote the adoption of road accident prevention practices\n- to develop and supervise regulations applicable to road traffic\n- to compete for road construction and other projects on the open market\n- to promote and undertake research into any matter relating to the performance of its functions.\n\nAdministrative Arrangements\n\nThe Roads Corporation is subject to the control and general direction of the Director-General of Transport and, ultimately the Minister for Transport. A Roads Corporation Board is appointed by the Minister to provide advice to the Chief Executive of the Corporation.\n\nIn addition, the Roads Corporation is assisted by a Road Safety Board appointed by the Minister for Transport. The Board reports to the Corporation on road safety matters.\n\nAlthough the merger of the Road Construction Authority (VA 1054) and the Road Traffic Authority (VA 1036) to form the Roads Corporation brought responsibilities relating to both road construction and traffic management within the ambit of the one agency, in its early stages the Corporation has continued to operate with two distinct functional divisions. Corporate and management services are, however being integrated and a common record-keeping system has been established. Further research will be necessary to determine the extent to which the functional division is retained in the Corporation's structure in the long term."

Prior to the establishment of the Corporation responsibility was shared by the State Transport Authority commonly known as V/Line (VA 1038) (primarily operating outside the Melbourne metropolitan area) and the Metropolitan Transit Authority (VA 1044) primarily operating within the metropolitan area.\n\nFunctions\n\nThe functions of the Public Transport Corporation, as laid down by its establishing legislation, are essentially an amalgamation of those carried out by the two agencies previously responsible for the provision of public transport services. They include:\n\n to provide, manage and operate transport services and facilities for passengers and freight\n to arrange with other transport operators, people and bodies for the provision of transport services\n to control and maintain all railway and railway ancillary equipment in the state\n to co-ordinate transport services\n to develop integrated ticket systems\n to develop new modes of transport\n to promote and undertake research into any matter related to the performance of its functions, powers or duties\n to provide, manage and operate tourist and recreational facilities\n to compete for work on the open market.\n\nAdministrative Arrangements\n\nThe Public Transport Corporation is subject to the control and general direction of the Director-General of Transport and, ultimately, the Minister for Transport.

This agency also had a similar sphere of responsibility to the later body, however it has been registered separately as VA 2272 and has been titled Rural Finance Corporation I in Public Record Office Victoria's Archival Control System.\n\n\nFunctions\n\nThe responsibilities of the Rural Finance Corporation, as set down by its establishing Act are to:\n\n- provide financial and other services to rural industries on the direction of the Treasurer\n\n- administer State and Commonwealth schemes of assistance or other schemes\n\n- administer the remaining purchase leases, mortgages, contracts of sale and other interests created under the Land Settlement Act 1959 (No.6534) and the Soldier Settlement Act 1958 (No.6373)\n\n- co-ordinate financial resources for investment in rural industries to facilitate an increase in the availability of finance to persons engaged in or seeking to establish rural industry\n\n- provide services and advice to government with regard to rural industries and rural affairs where appropriate to undertake promotional activities to further the objectives of the Rural Finance Act 1988 (No.44)\n\n- acquire and dispose of property and provide or arrange loans for commercial and rural purposes\n\n- manage administration of Closer Settlement and Soldier Settlement.\n\nIn addition, the Corporation inherited from the Rural Finance Commission (VA 1073) responsibility for administering the small number of continuing purchase leases, contracts of sale and mortgages created under the Land Settlement Act 1959 (No.6534) or the Soldier Settlement Act 1958 (No.6373). The Rural Finance Act repealed both of these Acts, but all contracts still in force at the time they were repealed remained in operation and were administered by the Corporation.\n\nThe Corporation also had responsibility for disposing of land which was reserved for soldier settlement or closer settlement and was, at 1 July 1988, not subject to any lease or purchase arrangement. The Rural Finance Act provided for all unallocated land set aside for such purposes to be vested in the Corporation and disposed of as the Corporation saw fit.\n\nIn November 1988 most of the assets and liabilities of the Victorian Economic Development Corporation (VA 1109) were transferred to the Rural Finance Corporation after the VEDC was wound down. This included administering commercial and rural loan arrangements established by the VEDC.\n\nOther schemes administered by Rural Finance Corporation included Natural Disaster Relief Schemes and the Young Farmers' Finance Scheme which provided funds at a concessional rate to young farmers for the purchase of stock, equipment and land.\n\n\nAdministration\n\nThe Corporation was administered by a Board of Management appointed by the Governor-In-Council and had a Chief Executive Officer appointed by the Board.\n\n\nResponsibility to Treasurer and Minister for Agriculture and Rural Affairs\n\nThe Corporation was subject to the general direction and control of the Treasurer with regard to its financial policies and practices and to that of the Minister for Agriculture and Rural Affairs with regard to its operations and overall policy. Ultimate responsibility for the administration of the Rural Finance Act 1988, however, lies with the Treasurer.\n\n\nPrivatisation and abolition\n\nIn 2014, the Victorian Government sold Rural Finance Corporation to Bendigo and Adelaide Bank. The Rural Finance Corporation Board of Management would operate until June 2016. The Rural Finance Act 1988 was repealed under the Rural Assistance Schemes Act 2016."

    "title": "Melbourne Underground Rail Loop Authority",
    "description": "Constitution of the Authority\n\nThe Melbourne Underground Rail Loop Authority (MURLA) was constituted under the provisions of the Melbourne Underground Rail Loop Act, 1 December 1970 (No. 8023 which came into operation on 1 January 1971.\n\nThe MURLA was a corporate body comprising nine members appointed by the Governor-in-Council on 1 February 1971 for a period of four years. The appointments of Chairman and Deputy Chairman became effective from the 1 February 1971 and 30 March 1971 respectively.\n\nFunctions and Powers\n\nThe MURLA was responsible for supervising and co-ordinating the planning, financing and construction of the Melbourne rail loop. The loop was to be made up of four new rail tracks under Spring and LaTrobe Streets (in four separate tunnels, the Burnley, the Caufield/Sandringham, the North Melbourne and Clifton Hill/city circle) forming a new link (a loop) in the existing railway system. Two additional tracks were to be constructed between Flinders Street and Spencer Street Stations as part of the loop with three new underground stations (Parliament, Museum and Flagstaff) to provide the northern and eastern regions of the City with rail connections to the entire suburban network. The Loop runs partly underground (through four tunnels), partly on the surface and partly elevated.\n\nOn its completion the Loop was to be fully integrated with the suburban rail network. When completed responsibility for the Loop was to be transferred to the Victorian Railway Board to be maintained by the Commissioners.\n\nThe Authority was empowered to appoint a General Manager, Secretary and other officers and staff. The officers and employees were entitled to the conditions of employment and remuneration as determined by the Authority and were not subject to the provisions of the Public Service Act, 1958.\n\nThe Authority could enter into agreements with the Railway Construction and Property Board or the Victorian Railway Board, the Council of the City of Melbourne or any other public statutory body.\n\nThe MURLA was empowered to borrow money by issuing Inscribed Stock/or Debentures guaranteed by the Government of Victoria.\n\nBefore the end of each financial year it was to prepare an estimate of the probable expenditure which became the basis of the Authority's borrowing programme. Interest, redemption payments and the administrative costs not proposed to be met by the Authority's borrowings were met by contributions required to be made by the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works, the Melbourne City Council, the Victorian Railway Commissioners and from the Consolidated Fund.\n\nTo fulfil its functions the Authority was empowered to acquire necessary property, to control developments adjacent to the loop and to enter into appropriate constructional agreements and financial agreements.\nPrevious Agency\n\nPrior to the establishment of the Authority, considerable planning for the loop was carried out by the Railway Construction and Property Board. The MURLA continued the planning commenced earlier by the Railway Construction and Property Board.\n\nConstruction of the Railway Loop\n\nIn December 1978, the two elevated tracks between Flinders and Spencer Street Stations were opened to rail traffic. It was the first fully operational section of the loop project handed over for service to the Victorian Railway Board.\n\nOn 14 November 1980, the first stage of the underground loop project, incorporating Museum Station and the loops servicing the Caufield-Sandringham and the Burnley group lines, was transferred to the Victorian Railway Board for operation.\n\nThe official inauguration of train operation took place on 24 January 1981.\n\nThe west booking hall of the Museum station, the south booking hall of Parliament station and the third tunnel (Clifton Hill) came into operation in 1982-1983.\n\nIn accordance with section 41 of Melbourne Underground Rail Loop Authority Act, 1970, the Governor-in-Council gave his approval for the completed section of the loop to be vested in the Victorian Railway Board. The Board was responsible for the operation and maintenance of these completed sections of the loop including Museum and Parliament stations.\n\nDissolution of the Authority\n\nWith the passing of the Transport Act 1983 (No. 9921) all the assets and liabilities of the MURLA were taken over by the newly constituted Metropolitan Transit Authority and the MURLA were taken over by the newly constituted Metropolitan Transit Authority and the MURLA ceased to exist. Completed portions of the loop which in previous years were vested in the former Victorian Railway Board were vested in the M.T.A. The Transport Act 1983 (No. 9921) was proclaimed to become effective from 1 July 1983.\n\nAll major construction work at Parliament station was completed in February 1984 following the opening of northern booking office near the corner of Lonsdale and Nicholson Streets.\n\nThe opening in May 1985 of Flagstaff, was the final station to be completed in the 18km of rail track in the underground Loop. The completion of the Flagstaff Station saw the end of construction on a $ 650 million Loop project."

    "title": "Cabinet Office [known as Cabinet & Executive Branch 1991-1992; Cabinet Secretariat 1992 - 2015]",
    "description": "Establishment of Cabinet Office\n\nThe Cabinet Office, located within the Department of Premier and Cabinet [VA 1039], was established in 1982 under the Cain Government to centrally coordinate the lodgement and distribution of submissions for consideration by Cabinet and its committees.\n\nOverview of Cabinet\n\nCabinet is the principle decision-making body of the government and includes the Cabinet Secretary and all ministers of the Crown. The Premier, as the leader of the government, is the chair of Cabinet.\n\nCabinet is a formal meeting of ministers; it has no legal powers or status. For example, there is no reference to Cabinet contained within Victoria's constitution and its decisions have no formal force until they are put into effect by its individual members as ministers, until they are endorsed by the Governor in Council or until legislative proposals are enacted by parliament. However, by virtue of the authority that members of parliament accord to Cabinet, it is the vehicle through which the decisions of the Executive are determined.\n\nCabinet considers important questions of policy, administration and the government's legislative program. Cabinet decisions are collective decisions and are binding on all ministers as government policy.\n\nCollective responsibility is supported by the strict confidentiality attached to Cabinet documents and to discussions in the Cabinet room. Cabinet and its committees provide ministers with the freedom to discuss proposals and a variety of options and views, while working towards a collective position. The openness and frankness of discussions in the Cabinet Room are protected by the strict observance of confidentiality.\n\nIn Victoria, officials do not attend Cabinet meetings and the Parliamentary Secretary of the Cabinet acts as minute taker and prepares a draft record of Cabinet decisions which is approved and signed by the Premier. However officials from the Cabinet Office established in 1982 do attend meetings of Cabinet Committees and record the decisions of those Committees.\n\nConstitution of Cabinet\n\nThe Ministers of the Crown form the Government and receive their commission from the Governor. They are appointed from the Members of Parliament belonging to the political party or coalition of parties commanding a majority in the Legislative Assembly. They are considered to be collectively and individually responsible to Parliament and through Parliament to the electorate, for the conduct of their Departments and the agencies within their portfolios.\n\nUnder the provisions of the Constitution Act 1975 (No.8750) Section 50, the Governor may appoint up to 22 Ministers of the Crown and members of the Executive Council, not more than six of whom at any one time may be members of the Legislative Council and not more than seventeen of whom may be members of the Legislative Assembly.\n\nBy convention a Government holds office only while it retains the majority support of the legislature and on losing that support the Premier is expected to either to hand in the resignations of his/her Ministry or to recommend a dissolution and general election.\n\nThe Premier is elected by a ballot of the Parliamentary members of his/her party. Although by convention it is the Chief Minister who nominates for appointment all other Ministers and who can recommend their dismissal, in practice in Victoria, the members of the Ministry are elected by the parliamentary members of the political party in government. The Liberal Party however reserves two positions for nominees of the Premier. The allocation of portfolios is the prerogative of the Premier.\n\nCabinet records prior to 1982 & the establishment of Cabinet Office\n\nThere is some uncertainty as to the form of Cabinet records prior to the establishment of the Cabinet Office in 1982. Although a Cabinet is thought to have operated in Victoria since the commencement of responsible government, relatively few records relating to Cabinet meetings prior to the 1980's are known to be extant and little is known about the recordkeeping processes associated with Cabinet throughout this period. . For the period prior to 1982 records relating to matters considered by Cabinet may also be found among the records of Ministers and of the departments of state and statutory authorities for which they were responsible. The records of the Governor (VA 466) and the Executive Council (VA 2903) may also include records relating to Cabinet matters.\n\nSince the Premier, as head of government, is responsible for the leadership of the Ministry and the co-ordination of Cabinet business and government policies and programs, the records of Cabinet may also be found in the records of the departments that have provided administrative support for the head of government function. The departments responsible for this function have been the Chief Secretary's Department (VA 475) until 1883; the Premier's Department or Office (VA 672) from 1884 to 1936; the Department of the Premier (VA 2717) from 1936 to 1982 and from 1982, the Department of the Premier and Cabinet (VA 1039). As the Premier was also Treasurer for the period 1936 to 1982, the Department of the Treasurer (VA 865) may also have provided administrative support for the head of government function, including co-ordination of Cabinet business.\n\nCabinet Office functions and administrative history\n\nThe functions of the Cabinet Office at the time of its establishment in 1982 were to:\n\n- provide administrative support and research for Cabinet, Cabinet Committees, the Premier and the Parliamentary Secretary of Cabinet;\n- centrally coordinate the lodgement and distribution of Cabinet submissions;\n- maintain, record and distribute Cabinet decisions;\n- monitor and assist with co-ordination of the Government's legislative program;\n- maintain a register of Cabinet decisions approved by the Premier for release under the Freedom of Information legislation; and\n- assist with Cabinet programming and agenda setting including the forward planning of major initiatives to ensure effective use of Cabinet time.\n\nThe Cabinet Office maintained contact with and provided advice to departments and agencies on the preparation of submissions for Cabinet. The Cabinet Office liaised on a day to day basis with the Parliamentary Secretary of the Cabinet. This process is particularly important in relation to the lodgement of Cabinet papers, the setting of the Cabinet agenda and the distribution of the Cabinet record. The Cabinet Office also liaised with the Parliamentary Secretary in relation to the legislative program.\n\nSince 1991 the Cabinet Office has undergone multiple name changes and moved across groups/divisions of DPC (VA 1039).\n\nIn 1991 during the Kirner Government, the Cabinet Office became the Cabinet and Executive Branch which was part of the Government Group of DPC.\n\nThe functions of the Cabinet and Executive Branch were to:\n- provide administrative and policy support for the Premier, the Parliamentary Secretary of the Cabinet, Cabinet and Cabinet Committees\n- receive, process and distribute submissions to be considered by Cabinet and its committees\n- distribute Cabinet and Cabinet Committee decisions and monitor their implementation\n- assist the Premier and the Parliamentary Secretary with the programming of Cabinet business and setting of agendas\n- monitor and coordinate the Government's legislative program\n- liaise with and advise administrative units and agencies on Cabinet processes and requirements\n- maintain a register of Cabinet decisions as required by the Freedom of Information Act\n- provide legal and policy advice and administrative support for the Premier and Secretary on parliamentary law and practice, and for the Executive Council\n\nFollowing the election of the Kennett Government in October 1992, the cabinet services and policy advising areas of DPC were merged and restructured into a new entity, the Cabinet Office. This office had the following branch structure:\n- Legal\n- Resources and Development\n- Micro-Economic Reform\n- Strategic Planning and Review\n- Financial and Budget Policy\n- Justice and Social Policy\n- Commonwealth-State Relations\n- Cabinet Secretariat\n\nThe Cabinet Secretariat was responsible for providing secretariat services and managing information flows for the Cabinet and Executive Council. Its responsibilities included the coordination of the Government's legislative program and response to a range of Parliamentary matters, and the provision of advice on executive government and Parliamentary processes.\n\nIn 2002 during the Bracks Government, the Cabinet Office was replaced by the Government, Resources & Infrastructure Division. The Cabinet Secretariat continued as a branch under this newly formed division and then went on to move multiple times between divisions/groups of DPC. In 2003 it moved into the Strategic, Economic and Social Policy Division. In 2004 it moved into the Governance, Resources and Infrastructure Division and in 2005 it moved into the Policy and Cabinet Group. The functions of the Cabinet Secretariat as at 2005 were to:\n\n- provide secretariat services and manage information flows and official record for Cabinet (including Cabinet Committees) and the Executive Council\n- coordinate the operational arrangements for the delivery of the Government's Community Cabinet program - provide specialist advice to the Premier and participate in formal ceremonies as required\n- in liaison with the Cabinet Secretary, develop and maintain high quality systems and processes\n- coordinate the Government's legislative program and responses to a range of Parliamentary matters\n- provide advice on executive government and Parliamentary processes\n\nIn January 2015 following the election of the Andrews Government, the Cabinet Secretariat was renamed the Cabinet Office and moved into the newly formed Governance and Policy Group of DPC. The functions of the Cabinet Office were the same as that previously performed by Cabinet Secretariat. The DPC Annual Report of 2013/14 described the functions as:\n\n- deliver specialist support and advice to executive government to facilitate informed decision-making and link government with the Victorian community\n- provide a leadership role within DPC and across government in promoting compliance with Cabinet processes, including the exercise of parliamentary responsibilities by Cabinet members and Executive Council\n- ensure the security and preservation of Cabinet records\n- coordinate the Premier's correspondence"

    "title": "State Training Board",
    "description": "The State Training Board was created on 30 November 1987, under the provisions of the Post Secondary Education Act 1978. The State Training Board superseded the Industrial Training Commission (VA 900) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) Board (VA 1176).\n\nThe creation of the State Training Board meant that all types of training, including apprenticeships and technical and further education, were now the responsibility of the Education Department, rather than being split between the Department of Labour (VA 2777) and the Ministry of Education and Training (VA 1112). This was further consolidated in the Vocational Education and Training Act 1990 (No. 45/1990), which repealed the previous Industrial Training Act (1975) and formally abolished the TAFE Board and Industrial Training Commission.\n\nThe Board was made up of 12 members, representing business and industry employers, trade unions, training providers and community interests. Its main functions were to co-ordinate and administer the Government's training policies and administer the technical and vocational training services provided by the state and public authorities. It was also responsible for the administration of the State Training System, which included:\n\\* 33 TAFE Colleges\n\\* Apprenticeship and training systems\n\\* Industry training network and skills centres located either in TAFE colleges or in private industries, and\n\\* Five private hairdressing colleges\n\nThe office of the State Training Board existed as an Associated Administrative Unit within the Ministry of Education, under the Public Service Act. The Board was under the direct control of the Minister for Post Secondary Education through the General Manager of the State Training Board.\n\nAbolition\nIn 2000, the Government commissioned a review of post-compulsory education in Victoria. Following the release of the report of the Review of Post Compulsory Education and Training Pathways, the Government accepted the recommendations of the report and restructured the boards responsible for post compulsory education and training. In December 2000, the Victorian Qualifications Authority Act 2000 was passed, which amended to Vocational Education and Training Act 1990. This amendment abolished the State Training Board and transferred its functions to the newly-created Victorian Learning and Employment Skills Commission (VLESC) and the Victorian Qualifications Authority (VQA). VLSEC was responsible for advising the Minister about post-compulsory education, training and employment, and to monitor outcomes. The VQA took over the State Training Board's accreditation and certification functions.\n\nResearch note:\nThere appears to be confusion about when the State Training Board was actually abolished. The Victorian Qualifications Authority Act 2000, which amended the Vocational Education and Training Act 1990 to establish VLSEC and the VQA, retained some mentions to the State Training Board in Part II of the Act. At the same time, the former State Training Board was clearly abolished. These references to the State Training Board were not removed until 2002.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nSee below for inventory of series.

    "title": "Penal Hulk \"Sacramento\"",
    "description": "On 22 January 1853 \"An Act to make provision for the better Control and Disposal of Offenders\" (16 Vic.,No.32) was assented to. This Act authorised the Lieutenant Governor to proclaim any hulk to be used as a public prison. It is evident that the purchase by the Colonial Government of immigrant ships which had been deserted by their crews, and the subsequent fit out of the ships as penal hulks, was a response to a shortage of prison accommodation in the Colony, particularly for hardened criminals.\n\nThe hulk \"Sacramento\" was fitted out and moored in Corio Bay, off Geelong, in the latter half of 1853 and by December 1853 it held 79 prisoners, half of whom had been transferred from H.M. Gaol, Geelong. The hulk was formally proclaimed a Public Prison by the Lieutenant Governor on 15 march 1854, and by September of that year held its capacity of approximately 130 persons.\n\nIn terms of the corrective system of the time the \"Sacramento\" was viewed as a 'probationary' hulk - a stage between the 'punishment' hulk for hardened criminals, and the stockades which housed the less serious offenders.\n\nPrisoners detained aboard the \"Sacramento\" was required to undertake labor, either aboard the hulk, or on public works on shore. Prisoners showing good conduct could be removed from the hulk to a stockade and eventually emerge with a ticket-of-leave. Due to the expense of maintaining the hulks, and the shortage of labouring duties, all the prisoners aboard the \"Sacramento\" were removed to Pentridge before the end of 1857.\n\nAlthough it was intended that the use of the hulk as a prison would cease at this time, a shortage of prison accommodation for female prisoners led to the removal of female prisoners from the Western Gaols to the \"Sacramento\" on 1 January 1858. A number of children of the prisoners, as well as some destitute children and young offenders were also detained aboard the hulk at this time. On board the hulk the female prisoners were employed at washing, needlework and making clothes. A school was set up on board to occupy the children for several hours a day. In 1859 the female prisoners were to be transferred to the hulk \"Success\" and from there on to the Collingwood Stockade. It is not known whether this occurred in that year, nor is it clear whether the hulk was used over the next decade.\n\nBy 1872 the \"Sacramento\" was moored near the mouth of the Yarra to accommodate approximately 100 male prisoners who were employed by the Public Works Department on works on the Yarra embankment. In consequence of the management of the Port of Melbourne being transferred to the Melbourne Harbor Trust Commissioners in 1877, the works on the Yarra were discontinued and the hulk was gradually vacated. When it was finally abandoned in March 1878 it was transferred to the Torpedo Corps.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nSee listing below and List of Holdings 1985 section 13.13.0."

    "title": "Department of Conservation and Environment",
    "description": "Overview of Department\n\nIn April 1990 functions from three previous departments were transferred to the newly established Department of Conservation and Environment. The creation of this department reflected the Government's intention to further integrate management of natural resources and public land.\n\nAll the responsibilities of the Department of Conservation, Forests and Lands (VA 1034) including: Crown lands (public), botanic gardens, Herbarium, National parks, forests, soil conservation, fisheries and wildlife, conservation of flora, coastal management, historic sites on Crown lands, commercial fishing licences, fish marketing, and noxious weeds and vermin destruction in forests became the responsibility of the Department of Conservation and Environment.\n\nThe water resources management and rural water resources policy responsibilities of the Department of Water Resources (VA 2354) were also transferred, as were the following \"heritage\" and \"environment\" functions of the Ministry for Planning and Environment (VA 1024): National Estate and environment protection (policy and planning).\n\nState participation in national Clean Up Australia Day was transferred to the Department in January 1991 from the Department of Premier and Cabinet (VA 1039).\n\nA Department of Water Resources (VA 3132) was established in January 1992 and inherited responsibility for the water resource management and rural water resources policy responsibilities of the Department of Conservation and Environment.\n\nIn July 1992 responsibility for the Botanic Gardens and the Herbarium was transferred to the recently established Royal Botanic Gardens Board (VA 3124).\n\nAfter the October 1992 general election all of the functions of the Department of Conservation and Environment were transferred to the newly constituted Department of Conservation and Natural Resources.\n\nOverview of Functions\n\nSince 1987 primary responsibility for managing unalienated land (Crown land) not actually assigned for specific purposes (eg. roads, railways and schools) has been divided into\n\n\\* Crown lands (government) for land available for sale or use by the government of the day (see VRG 100 Finance)\n\n\\* Crown lands (public) for land (reserved or unreserved) maintained for public use or benefit\n\nThe primary functions of this Department comprise or are closely related to Crown Lands (public).\n\nThe public land management function includes the administration of leases and licences authorising occupation and use of unreserved public land and monitoring and co-ordinating Committees of Management directly responsible for public reserves; protection of natural heritage and ensuring natural values are protected on all Crown land where productive uses occur; as well as those aspects of cultural heritage protection relating to public land.\n\nThe conservation of flora and fauna and their environments (including marine and freshwater environments) along with the management of commercial fisheries (including recreational fisheries and the issuing of fishing licences) are also important functions within this portfolio. Conservation protection of Crown and private land, including reversal of land degradation caused by soil erosion, pest plants and animals, salinity, native tree decline and the protection of Crown land from fire are closely related functions.\n\nAn associated function to the public land management function is the responsibility for State forests and nurseries, including administration of licences and royalties for forest products, advice, marketing and sales for forestry industries, and management of state hardwood and softwood timber plantations and the Victorian School of Forestry and Land Management.\n\nSimilarly the management of national parks, wilderness parks, and state parks is closely affiliated with the public lands management function.\n\nThe administration and maintenance of the Royal Melbourne Zoological Gardens and the management and control of the Botanic Gardens and the National Herbarium are functions which have, in the 20th century, been administered alongside the public lands function.\n\nEnvironment protection functions encompass policy and planning for environment protection, including co-ordinating the Government's response to the Greenhouse Effect and Greenhouse monitoring, developing statewide land-use controls and regional environment plans, advising government agencies, industry and the community on environmental matters as well as the provision of facilities for marine and environmental research, e.g. the Arthur Rylah Institute for Environmental Research and the Marine Science Laboratory. (The Office of the Environment was an Associated Administrative Unit of the Department between January 1991 until October 1992.)\n\nCrown Lands (Government)\n\nThis function encompasses the control and management of crown lands assigned for use by government or for sale or development, including :\n\n\\* land sales\n;\\* ownership of land and buildings used for government purposes.\n\nDivision of Responsibility for Public and Government Crown Land\n\nAround 1987 the government commissioned a report into public land management which recommended the management of Crown lands be separated according to a classification which identified Public land as that which needs to be retained permanently for the \"public benefit\" because of its natural resource, environmental resource or heritage attributes and Government land as property used for the provision of goods and services by public agencies. A Bill of Parliament to authorise the transfer of Government land management, lease and sale functions to the Minister for Property and Services (VRG 69) was prepared but never tabled. In order to effect the intention of the Bill sections of the Land Act 1958 (6284) were subsequently transferred to the Minister for Property and Services via Administrative Arrangements Order (No. 58) 1988. This transfer of functions has been described as \"administratively clumsy\". Although the power to sell Crown land was transferred to Property and Services (VRG 69), the ability to lease designated government land (usually in the metropolitan area) had to be effected by the Department of Property and Services (VA 430) acting as an agent for the Department of Conservation, Forests and Lands (VA 1034). Similarly the Department of Conservation, Forests and Lands (VA 1034) retained authority for the sale of Crown land (usually in rural areas) acting as a land agent for Property and Services.\n\nThe Minister for Property and Services (VRG 69) became responsible for the sale and lease of Crown Land classified as Government land under the Government's assets sales program. Government land incorporated:\n\n\\* declared roadways (used)\n\\* railway permanent way and rail reserves\n\\* sites of premises and other land use for delivery of goods and services, eg. offices, schools, laboratories, depots etc.\n\nCrown Lands (Public)\n\nThis function encompasses the control and management of crown lands generally, including :\n\n\\* unalienated lands not assigned to be used for government purposes\n;\\* lands and waters reserved for public use, benefit and/or enjoyment ie. public reserves\n;\\* management of all licences and leases of unalienated crown land eg. pastoral leases, 19th century land selection, occupation licences.\n\nThe prime activity is the management of all public land including reserved and unreserved lands. The regulation of occupation and use of unreserved public land and the removal of natural materials (eg. gravel, sand and stone) is governed by leases and licences. Such land can be occupied for commercial and agricultural purposes and for recreational purposes, including coast and waterway sites occupied by boating clubs and private moorings. Unreserved lands subject to classification review are managed as public land until their classification into government or public land. Monitoring and co-ordinating the Committees of Management which directly manage land reserved for public purposes. This function does not encompass the management of National Parks post 1956 or State Forests post 1907.\n\nBackground\n\nIn the 19th century, after the initial seizure of the land from the indigenous population under presumption of the legal doctrine of \"terra nullis\", land administration focussed on survey and sale (alienation) of land and on the management of unalienated Crown land. In the 20th century the emphasis shifted from land settlement to management and conservation of public land.\n\nCrown land has traditionally consisted of land which has been reserved for particular purposes and unreserved land. Unreserved land includes land occupied under licence (including pastoral leases) and land set aside for roads. Authorised occupations include land held by lease or licence under the following categories: primary production, residential, recreational, public utility, industrial, commercial. These occupations have, since permanent white settlement, been controlled and administered by leases, licences and permits pursuant to a number of Acts, including 19th century \"pastoral lease\" legislation and \"land selection\" leases and licences. By the mid 1980's two thirds of Crown land leases and licences related to the occupation of unused roads and water frontages.\n\nIn the 19th century crown land administration included regulation of the alienation of crown land by auction and selection; settlement of disputes regarding alienation and occupation; issue of occupation licences and leases and ensuring compliance with the conditions of such licences and leases; issue of Deeds of Grant for alienated land and for reserves granted for public purposes such as schools and churches; issue of licences for pastoral occupation and determination of rents; control and management of public parks, reserves and commons, alpine resorts and; prevention of the unauthorised use or occupation of crown lands.\n\nIn the 20th century the focus of this function has been the management of the State's public land through the administration of leases and licences for unreserved land; the support, co-ordination and monitoring of committees of management responsible for over 4000 Crown reserves; and the control of pests and weeds and development of management plans for public land. Closely related functions which have developed alongside the public land function are the management of national parks, State forests and historic sites on Crown lands; soil conservation, protection and management of fisheries and wildlife, conservation of flora, research institutes, coastal management, management of botanic gardens, the National Herbarium, and zoos.\n\nPastoral Leases\n\nAfter 1829 as white settlement in New South Wales (and the Port Phillip District) grew the emphasis of land administration shifted from small-scale land grants, encouraging agricultural production, to tickets of occupancy, later to become the pastoral licence and leases of the 1830's and 1840's. In the years from first European settlement in the Port Phillip District in the early 1830s the fertile regions of Victoria had been turned into sheep runs by squatters whose possession of the land rested on simple occupancy. By 1838 practically the whole of the present Western District had been occupied and flocks numbered more than 310,000. By 1840 this number had almost doubled [Australian Encyclopaedia, Grollier, Sydney, n.d, Volume IX, p.118]\n\nAfter 1838 the occupiers of these pastoral runs in the Port Phillip... truncated"

    "description": "The Department of Planning and Urban Growth was established in April 1990 and inherited responsibility for the general planning function along with responsibility for environment effects statements, heritage protection, and building regulation from the Ministry for Planning and Environment (VA 1024). Responsibility for the land monitoring function was transferred from the Department of Management and Budget (VA 1022) in the same year.\n\nIn November 1991 the Department was abolished and all its functions (except land monitoring) transferred to the Department of Planning and Housing (VA 3013) so named to reflect the amalgamation of the general planning functions with the following housing and public building functions which had previously been the responsibility of the Department of Housing and Construction (VA 2907). The land monitoring function was transferred to the Department of the Treasury (VA 3007).\n\nFunctions\n\nThe prime focus of the Department was managing and controlling the use of land.\n\nOverview of Planning Functions\n\nThe State Government became involved with land use planning in the 1920s in response to pressure from town planners for improved land use and better co-ordination of services. Municipalities were given power to zone land for residential use in 1921. The Metropolitan Town Planning Commission (VA 3131) (est. 1922) recommended development of planning schemes with statutory force to be administered by municipalities. Little was done, however, to implement these proposals during the depression of the 1930s.\n\nPrior to the Second World War, the Victorian Housing Commission (VA 508) was empowered to require municipalities to prepare zoning plans for residential areas as part of the Commission's slum abatement programme. During the War, the Commonwealth used its control of funding for housing to pressure the States to adopt both town planning and regional strategic planning as part of postwar reconstruction.\n\nRegional planning developed into the regional development and decentralisation functions of State Development & Decentralisation (VRG 51) and was carried out through the State Regional Boundaries Committee (est. 1944) and subsequently by the Central Planning Authority (est. 1946).\n\nStatutory (town) planning began in 1944 co-ordinated by the Town & Country Planning Board (VA 516). Under this statutory regime, municipalities (singly or jointly) prepared planning schemes for approval by the Minister, and then administered the approved schemes. Interim development orders provided planning authority in areas not yet covered by a scheme. The Melbourne & Metropolitan Board of Works (VA 1007) was given responsibility for the Melbourne metropolitan planning scheme from 1949 to 1985.\n\nIn 1968, amendments were made to planning legislation which broadened the planning function to include \"strategic planning\" and introduced greater co-ordination. A three-tiered planning system was introduced. Planning schemes now operate within a framework established by State-wide Statements of Planning Policy and Regional Planning Schemes. This system, further centralised and streamlined by legislative amendments in 1987, establishes closer links with other planning mechanisms in areas such as transport, education, heritage protection, and environment protection.\n\nDevelopment of Statutory Planning Functions [Planning Schemes (to 1988)]\n\nFrom 1922 to 1929 the Metropolitan Town Planning Commission (VA 3131), financed partly by Melbourne metropolitan municipalities and partly by contributions from the Railways, Tramways, Harbour Trust, and the Board of Works, operated in an advisory and honorary capacity. Its work included research and recommendations on urban development and town planning. Its 1929 report (concerning zoning, transport, recreation, harbours and rivers, building regulation, and conservation) provided a model for those urging government to enact a statutory planning regime and for those municipalities undertaking land use zoning up to 1944.\n\nAs part of postwar reconstruction, the Commonwealth prompted the States to undertake both town and regional planning. In Victoria, town planning functions were set up on a statutory basis administered through the Town and Country Planning Board (T&CPB) (VA 516). Regional planning (cf. regional development) was carried out through the State Regional Boundaries Committee and subsequently by the Central Planning Authority.\n\nThe work of the T&CPB in the preparation, amendment, administration and enforcement of planning schemes and interim development orders included:\n\n co-ordinating and advising planning authorities responsible for developing and administering statutory planning schemes, and\n\n advising the Minister whether or not schemes and scheme amendments prepared by municipalities and other planning authorities should be approved and gazetted.\n\nMelbourne and Metropolitan Statutory Planning 1949 - 1988 [Planning Schemes (to 1988) Melbourne and Metropolitan]\n\nBecause most municipalities had failed to use their new planning powers, in 1949 the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works (VA 1007) was given the task of preparing a metropolitan planning scheme. Responsibilities transferred to the MMBW for the metropolitan area included:\n\n preparation or amendment of planning schemes and interim development orders\n\n levying of annual metropolitan improvement rate to recover expenses of planning activities\n\n administration and enforcement of the provisions or sections of the provisions of schemes including consideration and determination of planning permit applications and ensuring compliance with the planning controls and the conditions attached to planning consent\n\nThe first version of the Melbourne Metropolitan Planning Scheme (1954) was prepared by the MMBW and exhibited in 1953. The MMBW approved the scheme in 1958 but it was not until 1968 that the Minister for Local Government gazetted it as a legally enforceable document.\n\nAs a result of changes to planning legislation in 1968 the MMBW was given responsibility for statutory planning of an enlarged metropolitan area.\n\nThe 1971 amendment to the Mark I Scheme generated such widespread debate within the community that the Board re-evaluated its position and in 1974 published the Report on General Concept Objections to inform the public of its deliberations to the objections to the 1971 proposal. The Mark III plan, the Metropolitan Strategy, was presented in 1980.\n\nWhen the MMBW commenced its Mark I plan only a few local councils were engaged in scheme preparation. Local planning powers were not suspended but allowed to co-exist with those of the MMBW, leading to a complex process of land use control. In 1981 nine metropolitan municipalities had a planning scheme while 12 had Interim Development Orders, some requiring developers to apply for a permit from both local and metropolitan authorities. Gradually the MMBW negotiated with the relevant councils to reduce this duplication.\n\nIn 1979 planning legislation was amended to allow local councils to play a more clearly defined role. Subsequently municipalities were able to prepare local development schemes within broad regional guidelines. These schemes were to introduce even finer grained zoning than under the Melbourne Metropolitan Planning Scheme provided they did not conflict with it. Only one such scheme was ever approved and the local development schemes were repealed shortly thereafter.\n\nThe development control function of metropolitan statutory planning was largely delegated to local councils (around 60%) while the MMBW retained primary responsibility for permit applications concerning the boundaries of zones or reservations and for all land in certain zones, such as Rural Residential Zones, Reserved Industrial Zones and Special Conservation Zones. During the late 1970s and the 1980s local councils developed their role beyond that of making decisions in regard to planning applications for land uses and areas delegated by the MMBW.\n\nThe Development of Strategic Planning 1968 to 1988 [Planning (to 1988)]\n\nAfter the overhaul of state planning legislation in 1968 the functions undertaken by the Town and Country Planning Board were broadened to include\n\n the co-ordinated development of statewide general land use planning policies to provide effective guidance for the preparation of statutory planning schemes and co-ordination of planning mechanisms available to various government agencies and statutory authorities\n\n preparation of Statements of Planning Policy with the assistance of the State Planning Council, later the State Co-ordination Council. These bodies consisted of representatives of various service, development and conservation authorities and were to develop broad scale, strategic land use policy and produce statements of planning policy for specific areas or types of land use which when approved by the Minister and gazetted, became government policy and legally binding on both councils and regional authorities. Statements of Planning Policy which came into operation were:\n Statement of Planning Policy 1 (Westernport) 1970 (varied 1976)\n Statement of Planning Policy 2 (Mornington Peninsula) 1970\n Statement of Planning Policy 3 (Upper Yarra Valley and Dandenongs)\n 1971 (varied 1979)\n Statement of Planning Policy 4 (Yarra River) 1971 (varied 1979)\n Statement of Planning Policy 5 (Highway Areas) 1973\n Statement of Planning Policy 6 (Land Use and Aerodromes) 1973\n Statement of Planning Policy 7 (Geelong) 1973\n Statement of Planning Policy 8 (Macedon Ranges and Surrounds) 1975\n Statement of Planning Policy 9 (Central Gippsland) 1975\n\nIt was envisaged that regional planning authorities established under the post-1968 legislation would operate in most, if not all, the regions of Victoria. It was also envisaged that the Statements of Planning Policy would provide the guidelines for regional authorities to develop regional planning schemes (statutory) to be administered by local municipalities. However most of those regional planning authorities which were established were given primarily a strategic planning role rather than a statutory planning role.\n\nThe Planning and Environment Act 1987 [Planning, post 1988]\n\nAfter 1988 a more co-ordinated programme of statutory and strategic planning was conducted under the Planning and Environment Act 1987. The new legislation introduced broader heritage, urban and environment conservation planning controls into the planning process. Sections of the 1987 Act provide that all planning schemes must include provisions relating to the protection of both rural or natural area conservation and heritage and urban conservation including natural and other resources and the maintenance of ecological processes and genetic diversity. Planning schemes under the Act must also seek to conserve and enhance those buildings, areas and or other places which are of scientific, aesthetic, architectural or historical interest, or otherwise of special cultural value. These sections of the Act are in part a restatement of Government policy as expressed in the document Protecting the Environment. Conservation Strategy for Victoria 1987\n\nFunctions undertaken under this legislation can be summarised as:\n\n development and implementation of State and Regional sections of planning schemes. State sections provide for government policies and strategic planning issues such as highways and other matters of state s... truncated"

The Department also provides advice to Government on the financial consequences of policies.\n\nFunctions\n\nThe following functions are undertaken by the Department:\n\n- managing the collection of State revenues and advising on revenue raising issues,\n- advising on an managing the Government's Debt Management Strategy,\n- advising on the financial and economic aspects of inter-governmental relations,\n- advising on the financial aspects of major infrastructure proposals,\n- managing the financial assets of the State,\n- monitoring the financial performance and position of major Government Trading Enterprises,\n- overseeing public sector management reforms and Government Trading Enterprise reforms, and\n- overseeing the performance of Government financial institutions.\n\nState Revenue Office\n\nThe State Revenue Office was formed in April 1992, amalgamating the former Stamp Duties and State Taxation Offices. The principal purpose of the State Revenue Office is to collect duties and taxes imposed by a number of different Acts as listed below.\n\nThe Office administers the Stamps Act 1958, Land Tax Act 1958, Payroll Tax Act 1971, Business Franchise (Tobacco) Act 1974, Business Franchise (Petroleum Products) Act 1979, Energy Consumption Levy Act 1982, Financial Institutions Duty Act 1982, State Deficit Levy Act 1992 and the Debits Tax Act 1990. (Debits Tax is collected by the Commonwealth Government under an agreement with the State).\n\nLand Monitoring\n\nFrom 1978/79 until 1985 the Department of Property and Services (VA 430) had responsibility for the function of monitoring government land sales. This function was inherited by the Treasurer in 1985 and was the responsibility of the Land Monitoring Division of the Department of Management and Budget (VA 1022) until it was transferred to the Department of Planning and Urban Growth (VA 3006) in early 1990. In 1991 the function was transferred back to the Department of the Treasury (VA 3007) and remained with this agency until it was transferred to the Department of Finance (VA 3016) after the October 1992 election. In mid 1993 responsibility for land monitoring was transferred to the Department of Planning and Development (VA 3094).\n\nBackground\n\nAll purchases and sales of properties by Government of $100,000 or more require Land Monitoring approval to ensure that all Government requirements under the Land Acquisition and Compensation Act 1986 in relation to property transactions are met. The function was established to provide Government with an independent safeguard against further land dealings of the type criticised at the Gowans Board of Enquiry and later at the Frost Royal Commission. This function is completely separate from the budgeting and planning functions in relation to government real estate. The function encompasses:\n\n- monitoring all purchases and sales of properties by Government of $100,000 including assessing submissions from agencies and monitoring of auctions.\n\n- the development of policies for the management of government real estate\n- assisting in identifying properties that are surplus to current needs. Administering the Government's decision in relation to the disposal of surplus railway land."

Statements of Planning Policy which came into operation were:\n Statement of Planning Policy 1 (Westernport) 1970 (varied 1976)\n Statement of Planning Policy 2 (Mornington Peninsula) 1970\n Statement of Planning Policy 3 (Upper Yarra Valley and Dandenongs)\n 1971 (varied 1979)\n Statement of Planning Policy 4 (Yarra River) 1971 (varied 1979)\n Statement of Planning Policy 5 (Highway Areas) 1973\n Statement of Planning Policy 6 (Land Use and Aerodromes) 1973\n Statement of Planning Policy 7 (Geelong) 1973\n Statement of Planning Policy 8 (Macedon Ranges and Surrounds) 1975\n Statement of Planning Policy 9 (Central Gippsland) 1975\n\nIt was envisaged that regional planning authorities established under the post-1968 legislation would operate in most, if not all, the regions of Victoria. It was also envisaged that the Statements of Planning Policy would provide the guidelines for regional authorities to develop regional planning schemes (statutory) to be administered by local municipalities. However most of those regional planning authorities which were established were given primarily a strategic planning role rather than a statutory planning role.\n\nThe Planning and Environment Act 1987 [Planning, post 1988]\n\nAfter 1988 a more co-ordinated programme of statutory and strategic planning was conducted under the Planning and Environment Act 1987. The new legislation introduced broader heritage, urban and environment conservation planning controls into the planning process. Sections of the 1987 Act provide that all planning schemes must include provisions relating to the protection of both rural or natural area conservation and heritage and urban conservation including natural and other resources and the maintenance of ecological processes and genetic diversity. Planning schemes under the Act must also seek to conserve and enhance those buildings, areas and or other places which are o... truncated"

    "description": "Establishment\n\nFollowing significant machinery of government changes after the election of the first Kennett Government in October 1992, the Department of Finance was established by Administrative Arrangements Order No.114.\n\nFunctions\n\n\\* All functions from the previous Ministry of Finance (VA 3016) except the Budget Division and the Office of the Valuer-General;\n\n\\* the following functions from the Department of the Treasury:\n\n\\* Financial Institutions Branch, Superannuation Policy Branch, Information and Commercial Division;\n\n\\* Information Victoria from the Ministry of Ethnic, Municipal and Community Affairs (VA 3015).\n\nThe Department of Finance is responsible for developing strategies and processes to improve the management of the State's resources by establishing guidelines and standards in the financial and resource management programs of agencies.\n\nThe Department achieves these objectives by:\n\n\\* managing the Public Account, setting accounting standards and developing policies to improve financial management performance across agencies;\n\\* providing advice to Government departments and agencies in valuation and survey matters;\n\\* managing State owned and leased property assets, including Government accommodation;\n\\* managing Information Technology policy, major projects and services;\n\\* managing policy, developing strategies and ensuring cost effectiveness and efficiency in the financial management of Superannuation, on behalf of the State;\n\\* Vehicle Fleet Management policy, monitoring and regulation;\n\\* managing insurance liability on behalf of Budget Sector departments; and\n\\* providing corporate management and executive support services to the Secretary and the Minister.\n\nComptroller-General\n\nResponsible for the management of resources available to government agencies; provides advice on accounting, finance reporting and systems issues; manages the Public Account; maintains the Public Ledgers which record the financial transactions of the State; manages the Unclaimed Moneys Fund.\n\nAsset Management and Accommodation Division\n\nResponsible for government owned land and Crown land sales and assessment, location and fitout of government accommodation.\n\nInformation Technology Policy\n\nProvides advice and assistance on agencies' information technology plans through development of strategies and guidelines.\n\nVicComputing (Victorian Government Computing Service)\n\nVictorian Public Sector Mobile Radio Network\n\nOperate a mobile radio network which will allow agencies to share infrastructure and data communications capability.\n\nOffice of Geographic Data Co-ordination\n\nCo-ordinating all activities relating to geographic information systems and developing the State's Geographic Information Management Strategy, a common logical geographic data model to support the business of government and other data users. [This is not the Landata system, and appears to be the digital mapping function usually undertaken within the Survey and Mapping area]\n\nCommercial Services including Government supply service, parking and motor vehicle services\n\nInformation Victoria\n\nPrinting and Publishing Services, Victoria and the Law Printer\n\nSurvey and Mapping Victoria\n\nOffice of the Valuer-General\n\nLand Monitoring\n\nFrom 1978/79 until 1985 the Department of Property and Services (VA 430) had responsibility for the function of monitoring government land sales. This function was inherited by the Treasurer in 1985 and was the responsibility of the Land Monitoring Division of the Department of Management and Budget (VA 1022) until it was transferred to the Department of Planning and Urban Growth (VA 3006) in early 1990. In 1991 the function was transferred back to the Department of the Treasury (VA 3007) and remained with this agency until it was transferred to the Department of Finance (VA 3016) after the October 1992 election. In mid 1993 responsibility for land monitoring was transferred to the Department of Planning and Development (VA 3094).\n\nBackground\n\nAll purchases and sales of properties by Government of $100,000 or more require Land Monitoring approval to ensure that all Government requirements under the Land Acquisition and Compensation Act 1986 in relation to property transactions are met. The function was established to provide Government with an independent safeguard against further land dealings of the type criticised at the Gowans Board of Enquiry and later at the Frost Royal Commission. This function is completely separate from the budgeting and planning functions in relation to government real estate. The function encompasses:\n\n\\* monitoring all purchases and sales of properties by Government of $100,000 including assessing submissions from agencies and monitoring of auctions.\n\\* the development of policies for the management of government real estate\n\\* assisting in identifying properties that are surplus to current needs. Administering the Government's decision in relation to the disposal of surplus railway land.\n\nLandata\n\nThis function encompasses the development and provision of a comprehensive and co-ordinated electronic information network for quick access to data relating to any block of land in Victoria drawing on a variety of government agencies' records and information systems.\n\nBackground\n\nLandata was established to co-ordinate the land information records and systems of various government agencies and to develop a computerised land information system for Victoria to provide ready access to information on each block of land in the State. In October 1982 a project team began developing a five year corporate plan for Landata, in conjunction with key user agencies. Responsibility for this function was transferred from the Department of Planning (VA 599) along with other planning functions in 1983. Landata became a division of the Ministry in January 1984.\n\nIn March 1985, following machinery of government changes, Landata was transferred to the Department of Property and Services (VA 430) and grouped administratively with other major land information and land administration agencies within the Department, such as the Titles Office, the Division of Survey and Mapping and the Valuer-General's Office. Prior to this the Government Computing Service of the Department of Property and Services had provided the Landata Division with advice on technical specifications for computing equipment for the Landata system. In January 1991 this function was transferred to the Ministry of Finance (VA 3016)."

The original Letters Patent setting out the Terms of Reference of the Royal Commission and appointing The Honorable Sir Sydney Frost, Q.C., LL.M. as Royal Commissioner was issued by an Order-in-Council on 20 June 1979, and published in the Victorian Government Gazette on 20 June 1979. A subsequent Order-in Council, appointed Sir Sydney Frost Q.C., LL.M to be Chairman of the Royal Commission on 24 July 1979 and was published in the Victorian Government Gazette on 25 July 1979.\n\nThis Royal Commission originated as a consequence of a previous Board of Inquiry into Housing Commission Land Purchases (VA 3017), and the failure to stop the extensive press speculation about the continual corruption in land purchases made by the Housing Commission.\n\nThe Royal Commission's Terms of Reference were to inquire into and report on\n\n1. The administrative methods and procedures adopted by the Housing Commission in the purchase of any land exceeding $100,000 (including adjacent parcels of land having an aggregate value exceeding $100,000) during the period commencing 1 July 1973 and ending 5 December 1978 (other than land reported upon by the Board of Inquiry (VA 3017) appointed by Order in Council made 9 August 1977, and in particular:\n\n(a) whether the methods adopted were adequate to ensure that the purchase prices paid for such land were fair and reasonable.\n\n(b) whether the valuations used in the purchase of such land were properly made and based.\n\n(c) whether there was dishonesty, impropriety, malfeasance or negligence on the part of any person in relation to the purchase of such land or the valuation thereof.\n\n2.(a) Whether the present methods and principles of valuation of land purchased by the Government or any Government instrumentality, and the instructions given to valuers in respect thereof, ensure accurate and properly based valuations.\n\n(b) Whether the provisions of section 5A of the Valuation of Land Act 1960 should be amended, and if so in what manner, in relation to the valuation of such land.\n\n3. Whether, having regard to -\n\n(a) the reconstitution of the Ministry of Housing and the Housing Commission effected by the Housing (Amendment) Act 1978.\n\n(b) the requirement of the Government that purchases and sales of land of a value exceeding $100,000 by Government departments and authorities is to be monitored by the Department of Property and Services; and\n\n(c) the requirement of the Government that in respect of all such purchases of land a valuation be obtained from the Valuer-General together with at least one other valuation or, where the proposed purchase price exceeds $1 million, at least two other valuations.\n\nThere is a need for any further changes affecting the administrative procedures and methods relating to the purchase of land by the Housing Commission exceeding the value of $100,000. In particular, whether there should be a statutory requirement of consent of the Treasurer to purchases of land by the Housing Commission.\n\nThe report of the results of this Inquiry is to be completed by Alfred James Ellwood, Esq., LL.M by 31 December 1979.\n\nFive amendments were made to the original Letters Patent of this Royal Commission, with two being additions to the original Terms of Reference. The first addition to the Terms of Reference was set out on the 22 January 1980 and published in the Government Gazette on 23 January 1980 and included\n\n4. The circumstances in which the Housing Commission entered into\n\n(a) A Contract of Sale dated the 6th Day of April 1976 for the sale to Damian Buildings Proprietary Limited of the whole of the land described in Certificate of Title Volume 8898 Folio 925.\n\n(b) A Contract of Sale dated the 4th day of April 1977 for the sale of R.& M.Cardigan Developments Proprietary Limited of the whole of the land described in Certificate of Title Volume 8786 Folio 756.\n\nincluding in each case the means and circumstances in which the amount of the consideration for the sale of the said land and the special conditions included in the Contract of Sale were determined, and in particular\n\n(i) Whether, in each case, the consideration for such sale and the terms and conditions thereof were fair and reasonable and appropriate in the circumstances.\n\n(ii) Whether there was dishonesty, impropriety, malfeasance or negligence on the part of any person in relation to the sale of such land or in arriving at the consideration for the sale of such land or in the determination of the terms and conditions upon which the land was sold.\n\nThe second addition made to the Terms of Reference set out on 30 September 1980 and published in the Government Gazette on 1 October 1980 were:\n\n5. The following matters arising out of the contract of sale dated 18 July 1972, entered into between the Housing Commission and North Terrace Club Investments Pty. Limited with respect to certain land in an area bounded by Haines Street, Abbotsford Street, O'Shannassy Street and Dryburgh Street and being the balance of the land remaining untransferred in Certificate of Title Volume 8885 Folio 519 as at 1 July 1972 namely\n\n(a) whether the consideration for such sale and the terms and conditions thereof were fair and reasonable and appropriate in the circumstances.\n\n(b) the circumstances and propriety of the Housing Commission entering into agreements of 18 April 1974, and 9 April 1976 with the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (\"the Bank) with respect to sums of $1 800 00 and $4 200 000, respectively, to be made available by the Bank to Inge Bros. Developments (Aust.) Pty. Limited which that company was to use to develop the land the subject of the aforesaid contract of sale on behalf of North Terrace Club Investments Pty. Limited.\n\n(c) whether the sale of the land and the intended development of the land as referred to in the special conditions which form part of the aforesaid contract of sale was appropriate in the circumstances or whether the Housing Commission should itself have proceeded with the development of the land.\n\n(d) whether the special conditions in the contract of sale relating to the intended development of the land were appropriate in the circumstances.\n\n(e) whether the development of the land has been carried out in accordance with the special conditions and, if not, the reason therefore; and\n\n(f) whether there was any dishonesty, impropriety, malfeasance or negligence on the part of any person in relation to the sale of such land or in arriving at the consideration for the sale of such land or in the determination of the terms and conditions upon which the said land was sold or in the arrangements made by the Housing Commission with regard to the loan by the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited to Inge Bros. Developments (Aust.) Pty. Limited.\n\nThree of the Order-in-Councils extended the due date of the final report of the Royal Commission to 15 October 1981.\n\nThe final report of the Royal Commission was published in Papers Presented to Parliament: Session 1981-82 Vol 8, No 33-35 and Session 1981-82 Vol 9, No 36.\n\nThe Commission investigated purchases in the Melbourne metropolitan area as well as a large number of provincial areas. Its report, released on 15 October 1981, was critical of both the Ministry of Housing and of the Housing Commission and endorsed the findings of the earlier Board of Inquiry into Housing Commission Land Purchases (VA 3017).\n\nThe major changes implemented as a result of the final report were administrative procedures such as; valuations, budget, planning and accountability. The Ministry of Housing also discontinued the practice of purchasing large areas of land, for Housing Commission estate development."

However, annual reports and staff lists indicate the existence of the Division by 1982. Certainly it appears to have operated as a distinct administrative unit from 1983 onwards within the Department of Conservation, Forests and Lands, (VA 1034) and continues to have done so after its transition to the Department of Property and Services in 1985 and subsequently to the Ministry for Finance (VA 3016) in January 1991. For this reason the Division's commencement date has been given as 1983.\n\nFunctions\n\nSurvey Co-ordination\n\nUnder the provisions of the Survey Co-ordination Act 1958 the Division is responsible for the co-ordination of all survey and mapping activities undertaken by government departments and statutory authorities.\n\nCadastral (Land Ownership) and Topographic Mapping\n\nThe Division is responsible for the conduct of cadastral surveys to establish property boundaries, the maintenance of parish plans recording allocation of property and the control and conduct of geodetic and trigonometric surveys which form the basis of all cadastral and topographic surveys.\n\nThe Division is the central government mapping agency providing cartographic services to both the government and the public.\n\nStatus of Crown Land\n\nResponsibility for the maintenance of a Central Plan Register which records the status of all unalienated Crown land is also vested in the Division. The unit is also responsible for all Crown boundaries and for the provision of surveys and reports associated with the alienation (sale) and reservation of Crown land.\n\nCentral Plan Office and Vic Image\n\nThe Division administers the Central Plan Office, responsible for the maintenance and care of all maps and plans as well as the provision of access to these to the public through the sale of copies of maps, plans and photographs. The Division is also responsible for state aerial photography and photographic, microfilm and reproduction services to the government through the Central Photographic Laboratory and the Central Microfilm Bureau incorporated as VicImage in 1990.\n\nRecord Systems\n\nSince 1985 the Division has maintained its own correspondence registry while general service records (accounts and personnel, etc.) were maintained by the Department of Property and Services to 1991 and subsequently by the Ministry of Finance (VA 3016).\n\nPrior to 1985 the Division's correspondence records were maintained by the Department of Conservation, Forests and Lands (VA 1034) and formerly by the Department of Crown Lands and Survey (VA 538).\n\nLocation of Records\n\nThe Public Record Office has significant holdings of records of the Division of Survey and Mapping and its predecessors. See List of Holdings, 2nd Edition 1985 section 3.18.4 Surveyor General and 3.18.5 Surveyors Board for records related to the survey and mapping function in addition to the list below."

The report was originally commissioned by the Minister for Health (the Hon W A Borthwick) in December 1980. Terms of reference were expanded to include other disabilities in September 1982. The final report was submitted to the Minister of Health (the Hon T Roper) in December 1982.\n\nThe Act was proclaimed in a number stages. In July 1986 the Public Advocate was appointed under Schedule 3 of the Act. In April 1987, the President of the Board was appointed and operational provisions relating to the Office of the Public Advocate were proclaimed. The operational provisions relating to the Board were proclaimed on 14 July 1987. The Board commenced hearings on the same day.\n\nFunction\n\nThe Guardianship and Administration Board was a tribunal which was established by the Guardianship and Administration Act to legally protect the personal and financial affairs of adult disabled persons including matters relating to medical and financial powers of attorney. `Disability' is defined under Section 3 of the Act as including intellectual impairment, mental illness, brain damage, physical disability and senility.\n\nSpecific functions of the Board are:\n\n The appointment of guardians to make personal or lifestyle decisions on matters such as accommodation or health care. Guardians appointed were usually either a friend or relative of the disabled person, or in instances where no such person was available or suitable, the Public Advocate.\n\n An exception to the above is that guardians could give approval for certain major medical procedures without Board approval. Procedures identified are sterilisation, pregnancy termination and donation of non-regenerative tissue.\n\n This function effectively commenced with the establishment of the Board.\n\n The appointment of administrators to oversee the management of the financial affairs of disabled persons. Administrators appointed could be friends or relatives of the disabled person, accountants, solicitors, trustee companies or the State Trustee.\n\n In this area the Board discharged a function originally performed by VA 2624 Master in Equity, Supreme Court. The Master, as Master in Lunacy, controlled and supervised the administration of the estates of persons found to be lunatic by inquisition, (their estates being administered by individuals known as `committees' who were appointed by the Court following an inquiry by the Master) and the supervision of the estates of persons incapable of managing their own affairs.\n\n Responsibility for the supervision of the estates of persons incapable of managing their own affairs and patients in mental hospitals passed to VA 719 Office of the Public Trustee in 1940. This agency lost its monopoly in this responsibility with the establishment of the Board and the appointment of alternative administrators.\n\n Revoking financial enduring powers of attorney. Under Section 118 of the Instruments Act 1958 the Board could revoke these powers if it was alleged that it was not in the best interests of the disabled person for the power to continue. (A financial enduring power of attorney was a legal instrument that allowed competent adults to appoint another to manage their financial affairs in the event of incapacity).\n\n The power was previously exercised by the Supreme Court.\n\n Granting medical enduring powers of attorney. Under an amendment to the Medical Treatment Act 1988 (Medical Treatment (Enduring Powers of Attorney) Act 1990), competent adults could personally appoint substitute decision-makers to make decisions concerning medical treatment if they subsequently lost the capacity to make such decisions for themselves.\n\n This function commenced with the proclamation of the Medical Treatment Act in August 1990.\n\nThe Board's jurisdiction relates to the affairs of adults (ie person 18 years and above) only. An exception relates to a number of children who had funds administered by the Courts. In these cases the Courts have used Sect. 52 of the State Trust Corporation of Victoria Act 1987 to transfer responsibilities to the State Trustee via a Board order. This had the effect of bringing these persons under the Board's jurisdiction.\n\nThe Board's jurisdiction did not extend to legal affairs of able-bodied persons or disabled children. Such affairs were controlled by either the children's parents or the Family Court of Australia, the Supreme Court, the County Court or the Children's Court.\n\nAppeals against Board decisions could be made to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.\n\nComposition of the Board\n\nThe Board was constituted under Section 5 of the Act by:\n\n a President (a qualified legal practitioner) and\n other members necessary to ensure the proper functioning of the Board.\n\nSection 6 provides for the appointment of an executive officer and other employees.\n\nAll proceedings of the Board were conducted in public hearings.\n\nOffice of the Public Advocate\n\nThe Guardianship and Administration Board Act also created the Office of the Public Advocate. Its role was to advocate, promote and support the rights and interests of disabled persons. It frequently represented persons in Board hearings.\n\nDespite the interrelated role and a shared location with the Board, the Office of the Public Advocate was a separately constituted, administered and staffed agency.\n\nEstablishment of VCAT and the abolition of the Guardianship and Administration Board\n\nThe Victorian Civil and Administration Tribunal was established under the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 1998. It was created as a part of a package of reforms to improve the operation of the justice system in Victoria by amalgamating a number of tribunals.\n\nThe Guardianship and Administration Board was abolished under section 117 of the Tribunals and Licensing Authorities (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act 1998. VCAT subsequently assumed the jurisdiction that was exercised by the Guardianship and Administration Board.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nSee below for records of the Guardianship and Administration Board.\n\nFor records of the Master in Equity see section 3.4.10 of the List of Holdings 2nd edition 1985. For records of the Public Trustee see section 3.4.9."

    "title": "Parliamentary Secretary of the Cabinet",
    "description": "Establishment and Legislative Basis\n\nThe position of Parliamentary Secretary of the Cabinet was formally established by the Officials in Parliament Act 1947 (no.5252). This Act provided that any member of either the Legislative Assembly or Council who undertook the duties of Parliamentary Secretary of the Cabinet was entitled to receive an allowance in addition to his or her salary as a Member of Parliament.\n\nDevelopment of the Role of Parliamentary Secretary\n\nAlthough the position was established in 1947, it seems likely that the Parliamentary Secretary did not provide a Cabinet Secretariat until the 1980's. Prior to this it is not even clear whether the position was always occupied. Until the 1980's staff of the Premier's Department prepared agendas for Cabinet meetings and coordinated the distribution of any Cabinet papers that were drawn up. There are divergent views on the mechanism used to record Cabinet decisions prior to 1982, however this was in theory the primary role of the Parliamentary Secretary of the Cabinet.\n\nThe commencement of the John Cain Labor Government in April 1982 saw the Parliamentary Secretary's role grow to become that of Cabinet coordinator. The Parliamentary Secretary's responsibilities included recording Cabinet decisions, coordinating and distributing Cabinet papers and, in conjunction with the Premier, setting Cabinet agendas.\n\nAlthough the Parliamentary Secretary is not appointed as a Minister of the Crown and therefore is not a member of Cabinet, the extent to which the Parliamentary Secretary contributes to the deliberations of Cabinet appears to depend on the experience and background of the incumbent.\n\nSince 1982, and possibly earlier, the Parliamentary Secretary has also assisted in developing the government legislative program by prioritising the legislation to be drafted and presented to Parliament for each session.\n\nIn the 1980's the Parliamentary Secretary has also adopted a liaison role by serving as a contact point for members of the public seeking access to Ministers or Members of Parliament. The Parliamentary Secretary also liaises between the Cabinet and the political party in government.\n\nAdministrative support for the position of Parliamentary Secretary of the Cabinet has been provided by the Cabinet Office since the creation of that office in 1982.\n\nFurther information about the executive arm of government and about the Cabinet process can be found in the Inventory of Agencies for VRG 17 Executive and the Inventory of Series for VA 2989 Cabinet.\n\nRecords of the Parliamentary Secretary of the Cabinet\n\nSince at least 1982 there have been two classes of records which may be considered to be maintained by the Parliamentary Secretary of the Cabinet.\n\nThe first is comprised of Cabinet records. This includes agendas and submissions prepared for each Cabinet meeting and minutes, or a record of decisions, produced by the Parliamentary Secretary after each meeting. As the discussions of Cabinet are by convention regarded as confidential, so are these papers. It is not clear what form of record of Cabinet decisions was created prior to 1982. Since that time, however, a record of all cabinet decisions has been maintained in volumes by the Parliamentary Secretary in conjunction with the Cabinet Office. Similarly a copy of all papers distributed for Cabinet meetings is maintained.\n\nThe second class of records reflects more broadly the functions of the Parliamentary Secretary and, although material in it relates in part to the Cabinet process and Cabinet deliberations, it is not considered to be part of the cabinet record. This class includes correspondence received and sent by the Parliamentary Secretary from Ministers, various organisations and members of the public regarding a range of Parliamentary matters.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nFor information about the location of Cabinet records see VA 2989.\n\nSome correspondence of the Parliamentary Secretary of the Cabinet which is not considered to be part of the Cabinet record is held by the Public Record Office Victoria."

    "title": "Royal Commission Into the Tricontinental Group of Companies",
    "description": "Appointment\n\nThe Royal Commission into the Tricontinental Group of Companies was appointed by letters patent dated 7September and 22October 1990. The Commissioners appointed were the Honourable Sir Albert Edward Woodward, O.B.E., Q.C. (Chairman); Douglas Gilbert Williamson, R.F.D., Q.C.; and William Patrick Gurry, Esquire. William Gurry resigned his appointment and was replaced in October 1990 by Leo John Carden, Esquire.\n\nThe Letters Patent defined the terms of reference for the Royal Commission. The terms, broadly, were that the Commission should determine what matters and events caused the collapse of Tricontinental and to investigate the nature and extent of any criminal, civil or administrative responsibility for the losses amongst persons in Government, State Bank Victoria (SBV), or Tricontinental, or amongst auditors, valuers or advisers. The full terms of reference are set out in Appendix 1 and 2 to the First Report of the Royal Commission into the Tricontinental Group of Companies. (As at April 1993 copies of the first and final reports of the Commission had not been transferred into archival custody.)\n\nStructure\n\nThe Royal Commission operated with the following structure.\n\n The Commission\n ?\n Counsel Assisting the Commission\n ?\n Solicitors to the Commission\n The Solicitors acted for the Commission. They provided legal advice and assistance based on the material flowing from the investigations program, and prepared briefs and instructions for Counsel.\n ?\n ?\n Director of Investigations\nThe Director of Investigations had responsibility for the investigation teams consisting of lawyers, accountants, bankers, computer professionals and investigators. They conducted investigations, prepared reports and details of findings.\n ?\n Secretary to the Commission\nThe Secretary had responsibility for hearings administration (clerks of court etc), information and systems (including Registry), management, corporate services, personnel, finance, office services and support. The Secretary provided all administrative and support services to all units of the Commission.\n\n\nOperations\n\n The Commission sat and conducted hearings on 157 days between 29October 1990 and 7 July 1992. The continuous presentation of evidence began on 24 January 1991.\n\nA team of counsel assisting the Commission was led by Mrs Susan Crennan Q.C.. The firm of Clayton Utz was appointed as solicitors to the Commission. A firm of solicitors was used because the Victorian Government Solicitor, who might usually have been expected to act for a Royal Commission, was already committed to providing the Government with advice on matters that would or could arise during the Inquiry.\n\nInvestigations were undertaken by a team of investigators led by the Director of Investigations, Mrs Noreen Megay. Investigators included lawyers, accountants, bankers, financial specialists and a senior police officer.\n\nTo a large extent the investigations depended on documentary material which needed to be obtained from a variety of sources. The majority of such documents were obtained by summonses issued under powers vested in the Commission by the Evidence Act 1958. A smaller, but significant number of documents were obtained by powers delegated under Commonwealth companies legislation. These delegated powers were exercised primarily by Mrs Megay, Director of Investigations. These documents were obtained by notices issued under the Companies Code, to the end of 1990, and the Australian Securities Commission Act from January 1991.\n\nThe Commission's powers to compel the attendance and examination of witnesses and the production of documents were limited territorially to the State of Victoria. The use of Australian Securities Commission (ASC) delegated powers allowed the geographical jurisdiction to be extended to cover the whole of Australia.\n\nBackground to the Appointment of the Commission\n\nThe following extract from the First Report of the Royal Commission into the Tricontinental Group of Companies provides background information for the reasons the Commission was established.\n\n 1.1 The appointment of the Royal Commission on 7 September 1990 arose out of the collapse in 1989 of the merchant banking business conducted by the Tricontinental Group of Companies. This Group comprised the parent company, Tricontinental Holdings Limited, and its wholly owned subsidiary companies.\n\n 1.2 When Tricontinental Holdings Limited was formed in July 1978, the State Bank of Victoria (`SBV') acquired a 25% interest. In July 1985 the board of SBV resolved to increase SBV's interest to 100%. This was achieved in September 1985. Until the repeal of the State Bank Act 1988 by the State Bank (Succession of Commonwealth Bank) Act 1991, SBV was a statutory corporation of the State of Victoria. Before 1980 SBV was known as the State Savings Bank of Victoria.\n\n 1.3 Tricontinental operated with a high degree of independence from SBV until 21 May 1989. On that date problems relating to lending activities, liquidity and corporate management led the board of SBV to absorb Tricontinental's operations into SBV's own operating structure and accept responsibility for Tricontinental's financial affairs.\n\n 1.4 Tricontinental ceased to conduct new business as from 21 May 1989, but bad and doubtful debts owed by clients increased, as time went by, requiring provisions in the SBV group of accounts of $351m as at 30 June 1989, $1,114m as at 31 December 1989, and $1,712m as at 30 June 1990.\n\n The failure of clients to repay moneys due to Tricontinental meant that, in turn, Tricontinental would have been unable to repay moneys due to its lenders and depositors had SBV not taken over its liabilities.\n\n 1.5 The rapid escalation of Tricontinental's inability to pay its way was financially disastrous for both SBV and the State of Victoria. Just as SBV had accepted responsibility for meeting the obligations of Tricontinental, so too the State Government had accepted statutory and commercial responsibilities to support SBV.\n\n 1.6 On 31 December 1990 the State Government sold SBV to the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, as provided for by the State Bank (Succession of Commonwealth Bank) Act 1991.\n\n The proceeds of the sale enabled the State Government to cushion the impact of Tricontinental's actual and potential losses upon the finances of the State of Victoria.\n\nFirst Report of the Royal Commission into\nthe Tricontinental Group of Companies. pp 1-2\n\nReport\n\nThe exact date on which the Royal Commission ceased to exist is slightly confused. A State election had been called prior to the Commission's report having been tabled in Parliament. The Final report was delivered to the Attorney General in September 1992. The report was not at that time tabled in parliament.\n\nThe Final report consisted of four volumes. Three were made public in response to a Freedom of Information Request made by the Herald Sun newspaper and after the Premier obtained legal advice. The fourth volume was not made public at that time. It was claimed to have contained information the release of which could jeopardise possible legal actions. It was also claimed it would be inappropriate to release the document without the protection afforded by parliamentary privilege that the volume being tabled in Parliament would provide.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nA number of series of records of the Royal Commission have been transferred to the Public Record Office. They are records created by the Commission in exercising its authority as provided by the Letters Patent of its appointment and by Victorian legislation. Records not transferred include records created by investigative staff as delegates of the ASC. Such records were deemed to have been created by the ASC and were therefore not public records of the State of Victoria. They are believed to be in the custody of the ASC. Administrative records of the Commission are located within the Department of Justice. It is also possible that other records are held by that Department.\n\nSome records from both groups were destroyed by authority of the Commission or the ASC delegates (see, for example, VPRS 8387, Registered Correspondence and Documents Obtained) but without authorisation under the provisions of the Public Records Act 1973. Other records, for example records created by the solicitors to the Commission, Clayton Utz, that were not incorporated into the records of the Commission, remained the property of that firm. In addition, some records, particularly outward correspondence, may not have existed in hard copy (paper) form, and only existed on one of the several PC networks operated by the Commission. Similarly no, records of the Commission's investigative process, which was based around the use of a leased main frame computer and investigative software, are in custody. It is understood that system and software specification documentation is held by the Department of Justice."

    "title": "Department of Energy and Minerals",
    "description": "Following significant machinery of government changes after the election of the first Kennett Government in October 1992, the Department of Energy and Minerals was established by amendment of Schedule Two of the Public Service Act 1974. This was published in the Victorian Government Gazette No. S 53 on 9 October 1992.\n\nThe Department of Energy and Minerals assumed responsibility for all functions from the previous Resources Division of the Department of Manufacturing and Industry Development (VA 3012). It was responsible for the development of Victoria's energy and mineral resources and the regulation of exploration and mining operations throughout the State. The Department reported to the Minister for Energy and Minerals.\n\nThe Department provided advice to the Government on the operations of a number of Statutory Authorities, Boards and Public Utilities. These included the State Electricity Commission of Victoria (SECV; VA 1002), Gas and Fuel Corporation of Victoria (GFCV; VA 1040), Coal Corporation of Victoria (CCV; VA 2630), Renewable Energy Authority of Victoria (REAV; VA 3117), Extractive Industries Board, Mine Managers' Board and Office of the Mining Warden. The Department acted as a liaison between the statutory authorities in their dealings with the Government and other departments.\n\nStructure of Department\n\nEnergy Division\nKey responsibilities of the Energy Division included the technical regulation of onshore and offshore petroleum exploration, including the design, construction and maintenance of offshore platforms and onshore gas and petroleum product pipelines. It also developed policies relating use of energy in Victoria and liaised with the Federal Government about national energy policies and their impact on Victoria.\n\nMinerals Division\nThe mission of the Minerals Division was to facilitate the exploration and development of the State's mineral wealth. The Group was responsible for the administration of the Mineral Resources Development Act 1990 which involved:\n\n\\* ensuring exploration, development and mining operations were conducted in a safe manner (Mining Inspectorate)\n\\* administration of mining titles (Mining Tenements);\n\\* ensuring that mining activity was undertaken in an environmentally responsible manner (Environmental Unit); and\n\\* the collection, storage and dissemination of earth science information for the whole of Victoria (Geological Survey)\n\nThe Minerals Group also administered the Extractive Industries Act 1966 which involved the monitoring and control of exploration and extraction of construction materials such as sand, stone and clay.\n\nThe Department of Energy and Minerals was abolished under amendment to Schedule One of the Public Sector Management Act 1992. The amendment removed the Department of Energy and Minerals from Schedule One and replaced it with the Department of Agriculture, Energy and Minerals (VA 3744). The change was published in the Government Gazette Special No. 11 (S11) on 1 February 1995. The same gazette also published the transfer of all Acts from the Department of Energy and Minerals and the Department of Agriculture (VA 2649) to the Department of Agriculture, Energy and Minerals, under Administrative Arrangements Order No. 143."

At that time the Secretary of the Department of Justice was responsible to the Minister for Police and Emergency Services and Minister for Corrections, and the Attorney-General, Minister for Fair Trading and Minister for Women's Affairs.\n\nThe Department of Justice brought together all Government activities concerned with the reform, administration and enforcement of the law in Victoria, including all police and prosecution functions, administration of the Court system, provision of the prison system, administration of various tribunals established to protect citizens' rights, provision of emergency services, drafting of legislation, and provision of legal advice to Government.\n\nThe justice portfolio's principal functional areas included:\n\n- Victoria Police, responsible for the preservation of peace, the protection of life and property, and the prevention and detection of crime;\n\n- Fire and Emergency Services, responsible for the prevention and suppression of fires in metropolitan and country areas, and for providing services and training for natural disaster, emergency rescue, and civil defence activities;\n\n- Correctional Services, responsible for operating the adult corrections system;\n\n- the Police and Emergency Services Directorate, responsible for the co-ordination of policies and programs to maintain law and order and prevent and minimise the effects of fire and other emergencies;\n\n- Courts and Tribunal Services, responsible for the administration of the court system (comprising Supreme, County, Magistrates', Coroner's and Children's Courts) and tribunals including the Administrative Appeals Tribunal;\n\n- Information Registries, comprising the Land Titles Office and the Registry for Births, Deaths and Marriages, responsible for providing registration and information services regarding land dealings and ownership and births, deaths and marriages in Victoria;\n\n- Legislation Advice and Policy, responsible for the provision of advice on law reform, legislative program and associated legal policy;\n\n- the Chief Parliamentary Counsel, responsible for drafting of legislation;\n\n- the Victorian Government Solicitor's Office, responsible for provision of legal advice to the Government and its agencies;\n\n- the Fair Trading and Business Affairs Division (Fair Trading Victoria from 2002), responsible for maintaining an effective framework for Fair Trading in Victoria and for providing an effective business licensing and registration function; and\n\n- the Corporate Resources Division, providing management and administrative support to the Department.\n\nOffice of Women's Affairs\n\nAs a function of government, women's affairs evolved within the Premier's portfolio out of the promotion of equal opportunity under the Equal Opportunity Act 1977.\n\nUntil 1992 the Co-ordinator of Women's Affairs within the Department of the Premier (VA 2717) and its successor the Women's Policy Co-ordination Unit in the Department of the Premier and Cabinet (VA 1039) was responsible for:\n\n- provision of policy advice to the Premier on issues affecting the status of women,\n- monitoring and reviewing policies and programs which impact on women,\n- co-ordinating and monitoring the activities of agencies with the view to improve the status of women,\n- assisting agencies to enhance service delivery to women,\n- co-ordinating Victoria's responses to committees and inter-national agencies on women's issues,\n- representation of Victoria on Commonwealth-State committees,\n- the annual Women's Budget report,\n- the register of women interested in appointment to government boards and committee; and\n- liaison with non-government organisations providing services to women.\n\nAs part of machinery of government changes introduced in October 1992 the Women's Policy Co-ordination Unit was transferred to the Department of Justice and these functions became the responsibility of the Office of Women's Affairs.\n\nFollowing the election of the new Labor government in September 1999, in January 2000 the Office of Women's Affairs was moved to the Department of Premier and Cabinet (VA 1039) and renamed the Office of Women's Policy (OWP) to reflect its whole-of-government policy approach. In December 2002 the OWP transferred to the newly created Department of Victorian Communities (VA 4562).\n\nCommunity Council Against Violence\n\nThe Community Council Against Violence was established in 1989 to provide advice to Government about violence in the community. The Council was reconstituted and relaunched by the Attorney-General in 1993 with agreement from Cabinet. At this time the Council included three task forces: the Victims' Task Force, the Violence Against Women Task Force and the Community Safety Task Force.\n\nFrom 1989 to 1991 the Council was the responsibility of the Ministry for Police and Emergency Services (VA 421). As part of machinery of government changes announced in January 1991 responsibility transferred to the Department of the Premier and Cabinet (VA 1039) until 1992 when the Department of Justice assumed responsibility.\n\nUnder Administrative Arrangements Order No.182 dated 5 December 2002 (Victorian Government Gazette No. S 231, 5 December 2002) the Department of Justice took over responsibility of the portfolios of gaming and racing, which were subsequently administered by the Office of Gaming and Racing and the Office of Gambling Regulation.\n\nAbolition\n\nOn 1 January 2015, the Department of Justice was renamed Department of Justice and Regulation (DJR) (VA 5038) by Order of the Governor-in-Council under section 10 of the Public Administration Act 2004 (Victorian Government Gazette, S 432, Thursday 4 December). The name change was part of machinery-of-government changes made by the newly elected Labor Government under the leadership of Premier the Hon Daniel Andrews MP."

This came about by amendment of the La Trobe University Act 1964.\n\nFunctions\n\nThrough its affiliation with the La Trobe University, the University College's goals, broadly, were:\n\n to promote scholarly acquisition of knowledge through research and postgraduate research training;\n to promote scholarly transmission of knowledge in a wide range of disciplines through the establishment of postgraduate and undergraduate course work programs;\n to promote the application of knowledge by establishment of high quality professional training programs at undergraduate and postgraduate levels;\n to promote access to knowledge through accredited continuing education programs and other services;\n to promote community and University College interaction through the provision of consulting services, joint training programs with industry and other community agencies, and the presentation of cultural and artistic events.\n\nThe University College placed special emphasis on student and community needs in central and northern Victoria. Its long term aim was to satisfy criteria for accreditation as a self governing university.\n\nStructure\n\nThe University College was a body politic and corporate which was governed by a College Council, subject to the overall strategic management and direction of the La Trobe University Council. La Trobe University is therefore a superior agency to L.T.U.C.N.V. Directives to the College Council could only be issued, however, by a formal resolution passed by the University Council at a Special Meeting held for that purpose. The University College therefore had all the powers to conduct its own affairs in accordance with the La Trobe University (Bendigo and Wodonga) Act 1990.\n\nThe College Council consisted of 26 members who were occupants of specific positions or were appointed or elected. The specific positions were: the Vice-Chancellor of La Trobe University; the Principal of the College and the Chairperson of the College Academic Board. Appointments were made by: the Minister responsible; the Council of the University; the Governor in Council; and the College Council. Members were elected by and from: graduates of the College; students of the College; staff of the College and staff associations.\n\nPrevious Agency\n\nL.T.U.C.N.V. continued the functions previously administered by the Bendigo College of Advanced Education. The details of the affiliation between Bendigo C.A.E. and La Trobe University were contained in an Affiliations Agreement dated 30 July 1990.\n\nThe L.T.U.C.N.V. inherited the responsibility for the records of the Bendigo C.A.E. and its predecessor agencies. These agencies and their date ranges include:\n Bendigo College of Advanced Education: 1975 to 1990;\n The State College of Victoria at Bendigo: 1973 to 1975;\n Bendigo Institute of Technology: ? 1967 to 1975;\n Bendigo Teachers College: ? 1926 to 1973;\n Bendigo Technical College: 1959 to 1967;\n Bendigo School of Mines: 1873 to 1959; and\n\nLocation of the Records\n\nSee List of Holdings 2nd edition 1985, Section 5.21.0. Other records of the L.T.U.C.N.V. and its predecessor agencies are held by the University College's Archives."

    "description": "Establishment\n\nFollowing significant machinery of government changes after the October 1992 election the Department of Planning and Development was established by Administrative Arrangements Order No.114.\n\nThe Department inherited responsibility for all the functions of the short-lived Department of Planning and Housing (VA 3013) (planning, environment effects statements, heritage protection, building regulation, housing and design and construction of government buildings) and responsibility for the local government from the equally short-lived Ministry of Ethnic, Municipal and Community Affairs (VA 3015) which was administered through the Office of Local Government.\n\nIn mid 1993 responsibility for land monitoring was transferred to the Department from the Department of Finance (VA 3016).\n\nThe Department is administered by the Secretary for Planning and Development and serves four Ministers who constitute the Planning and Development Committee of Cabinet, the Minister for Planning (VRG 65), the Minister for Housing (VRG 106), the Minister for Major Projects (VRG 92) and the Minister for Local Government (VRG 57).\n\nThe Department is responsible for delivering programs, developing policy and fulfilling statutory requirements in the areas of housing, building, planning, building control, major projects and local government.\n\nFollowing significant machinery of government changes after the re-election of the Kennett Government in April 1996 the Department of Planning and Development was abolished. Under Administrative Arrangements Order No.150 all functions of the Department, except the Office of Housing, were transferred on 3 April 1996 to the Department of Infrastructure (VA 3971).\n\nOverview of Planning Functions\n\nThe State Government became involved with land use planning in the 1920s in response to pressure from town planners for improved land use and better co-ordination of services. Municipalities were given power to zone land for residential use in 1921. The Metropolitan Town Planning Commission (VA 3131) (est. 1922) recommended development of planning schemes with statutory force to be administered by municipalities. Little was done, however, to implement these proposals during the depression of the 1930s.\n\nPrior to the Second World War, the Victorian Housing Commission (VA 508) was empowered to require municipalities to prepare zoning plans for residential areas as part of the Commission's slum abatement programme. During the War, the Commonwealth used its control of funding for housing to pressure the States to adopt both town planning and regional strategic planning as part of postwar reconstruction.\n\nRegional planning developed into the regional development and decentralisation functions of State Development & Decentralisation (VRG 51) and was carried out through the State Regional Boundaries Committee (est. 1944) and subsequently by the Central Planning Authority (est. 1946).\n\nStatutory (town) planning began in 1944 co-ordinated by the Town & Country Planning Board (VA 516). Under this statutory regime, municipalities (singly or jointly) prepared planning schemes for approval by the Minister, and then administered the approved schemes. Interim development orders provided planning authority in areas not yet covered by a scheme. The Melbourne & Metropolitan Board of Works (VA 1007) was given responsibility for the Melbourne metropolitan planning scheme from 1949 to 1985.\n\nIn 1968, amendments were made to planning legislation which broadened the planning function to include \"strategic planning\" and introduced greater co-ordination. A three-tiered planning system was introduced. Planning schemes now operate within a framework established by State-wide Statements of Planning Policy and Regional Planning Schemes. This system, further centralised and streamlined by legislative amendments in 1987, establishes closer links with other planning mechanisms in areas such as transport, education, heritage protection, and environment protection.\n\nDevelopment of Statutory Planning Functions [Planning Schemes (to 1988)]\n\nFrom 1922 to 1929 the Metropolitan Town Planning Commission (VA 3131), financed partly by Melbourne metropolitan municipalities and partly by contributions from the Railways, Tramways, Harbour Trust, and the Board of Works, operated in an advisory and honorary capacity. Its work included research and recommendations on urban development and town planning. Its 1929 report (concerning zoning, transport, recreation, harbours and rivers, building regulation, and conservation) provided a model for those urging government to enact a statutory planning regime and for those municipalities undertaking land use zoning up to 1944.\n\nAs part of postwar reconstruction, the Commonwealth prompted the States to undertake both town and regional planning. In Victoria, town planning functions were set up on a statutory basis administered through the Town and Country Planning Board (T&CPB) (VA 516). Regional planning (cf. regional development) was carried out through the State Regional Boundaries Committee and subsequently by the Central Planning Authority.\n\nThe work of the T&CPB in the preparation, amendment, administration and enforcement of planning schemes and interim development orders included:\n\n co-ordinating and advising planning authorities responsible for developing and administering statutory planning schemes, and\n\n advising the Minister whether or not schemes and scheme amendments prepared by municipalities and other planning authorities should be approved and gazetted.\n\nMelbourne and Metropolitan Statutory Planning 1949 - 1988 [Planning Schemes (to 1988) Melbourne and Metropolitan]\n\nBecause most municipalities had failed to use their new planning powers, in 1949 the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works (VA 1007) was given the task of preparing a metropolitan planning scheme. Responsibilities transferred to the MMBW for the metropolitan area included:\n\n preparation or amendment of planning schemes and interim development orders\n\n levying of annual metropolitan improvement rate to recover expenses of planning activities\n\n administration and enforcement of the provisions or sections of the provisions of schemes including consideration and determination of planning permit applications and ensuring compliance with the planning controls and the conditions attached to planning consent\n\nThe first version of the Melbourne Metropolitan Planning Scheme (1954) was prepared by the MMBW and exhibited in 1953. The MMBW approved the scheme in 1958 but it was not until 1968 that the Minister for Local Government gazetted it as a legally enforceable document.\n\nAs a result of changes to planning legislation in 1968 the MMBW was given responsibility for statutory planning of an enlarged metropolitan area.\n\nThe 1971 amendment to the Mark I Scheme generated such widespread debate within the community that the Board re-evaluated its position and in 1974 published the Report on General Concept Objections to inform the public of its deliberations to the objections to the 1971 proposal. The Mark III plan, the Metropolitan Strategy, was presented in 1980.\n\nWhen the MMBW commenced its Mark I plan only a few local councils were engaged in scheme preparation. Local planning powers were not suspended but allowed to co-exist with those of the MMBW, leading to a complex process of land use control. In 1981 nine metropolitan municipalities had a planning scheme while 12 had Interim Development Orders, some requiring developers to apply for a permit from both local and metropolitan authorities. Gradually the MMBW negotiated with the relevant councils to reduce this duplication.\n\nIn 1979 planning legislation was amended to allow local councils to play a more clearly defined role. Subsequently municipalities were able to prepare local development schemes within broad regional guidelines. These schemes were to introduce even finer grained zoning than under the Melbourne Metropolitan Planning Scheme provided they did not conflict with it. Only one such scheme was ever approved and the local development schemes were repealed shortly thereafter.\n\nThe development control function of metropolitan statutory planning was largely delegated to local councils (around 60%) while the MMBW retained primary responsibility for permit applications concerning the boundaries of zones or reservations and for all land in certain zones, such as Rural Residential Zones, Reserved Industrial Zones and Special Conservation Zones. During the late 1970s and the 1980s local councils developed their role beyond that of making decisions in regard to planning applications for land uses and areas delegated by the MMBW.\n\nThe Development of Strategic Planning 1968 to 1988 [Planning (to 1988)]\n\nAfter the overhaul of state planning legislation in 1968 the functions undertaken by the Town and Country Planning Board were broadened to include\n\n the co-ordinated development of statewide general land use planning policies to provide effective guidance for the preparation of statutory planning schemes and co-ordination of planning mechanisms available to various government agencies and statutory authorities\n\n preparation of Statements of Planning Policy with the assistance of the State Planning Council, later the State Co-ordination Council. These bodies consisted of representatives of various service, development and conservation authorities and were to develop broad scale, strategic land use policy and produce statements of planning policy for specific areas or types of land use which when approved by the Minister and gazetted, became government policy and legally binding on both councils and regional authorities. Statements of Planning Policy which came into operation were:\n Statement of Planning Policy 1 (Westernport) 1970 (varied 1976)\n Statement of Planning Policy 2 (Mornington Peninsula) 1970\n Statement of Planning Policy 3 (Upper Yarra Valley and Dandenongs)\n 1971 (varied 1979)\n Statement of Planning Policy 4 (Yarra River) 1971 (varied 1979)\n Statement of Planning Policy 5 (Highway Areas) 1973\n Statement of Planning Policy 6 (Land Use and Aerodromes) 1973\n Statement of Planning Policy 7 (Geelong) 1973\n Statement of Planning Policy 8 (Macedon Ranges and Surrounds) 1975\n Statement of Planning Policy 9 (Central Gippsland) 1975\n\nIt was envisaged that regional planning authorities established under the post-1968 legislation would operate in most, if not all, the regions of Victoria. It was also envisaged that the Statements of Planning Policy would provide the guidelines for regional authorities to develop regional planning schemes (statutory) to be administered by local municipalities. However most of those regional planning authorities which were established were given primarily a strategic planning role rather than a statutory planning role.\n\nThe Planning and Environment Act 1987 [Planning, post 1988]\n\nAfter 1988 a more co-ordinated programme of statutory and strategic planning was conducted under the Planning and Environment Act 1987. The new legislation introduced broader heritage, urban and environment conservation planning controls into the planning process. Sections of the 1987 Act provide that all planning schemes must include provisions relating to the protection of both rural or natural area conservation and heritage and urban conservation including natural and other resources and the maintenance of ecologica... truncated"

    "description": "Overview of Department\n\nFollowing significant machinery of government changes after the October 1992 general election, the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources was established by Administrative Arrangements Order (No.114) 1992.\n\nAll the responsibilities of the previous Department of Conservation and Environment (VA 3004) including: Crown lands (public), National parks, forests, soil conservation, fisheries and wildlife, conservation of flora, coastal management, historic sites on Crown lands, National Estate, commercial fishing licences, fish marketing, environment protection and noxious weeds and vermin destruction in forests became the responsibility of the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources.\n\nThe water resources management and rural water resources policy responsibilities of the Department of Water Resources II (VA 3132) were also transferred to the Department.\n\nBy early 1994 responsibility for state participation in the national Clean Up Australia Day campaign was transferred to Melbourne Parks and Waterways (see VA 1007).\n\nFollowing significant machinery of government changes after the re-election of the Kennett Government in April 1996 the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources was abolished. All functions were transferred to the Department of Natural Resources and the Environment (VA 3972) on 3 April 1996 under Administrative Arrangements Order No.150.\n\nOverview of Functions\n\nSince 1987 primary responsibility for managing unalienated land (Crown land) not actually assigned for specific purposes (eg. roads, railways and schools) has been divided into\n\n Crown lands (government) for land available for sale or use by the government of the day (see VRG 100 Finance)\n\n Crown lands (public) for land (reserved or unreserved) maintained for public use or benefit\n\nThe primary functions of this Department comprise or are closely related to Crown Lands (public).\n\nThe public land management function includes the administration of leases and licences authorising occupation and use of unreserved public land and monitoring and co-ordinating Committees of Management directly responsible for public reserves; protection of natural heritage and ensuring natural values are protected on all Crown land where productive uses occur; as well as those aspects of cultural heritage protection relating to public land.\n\nThe conservation of flora and fauna and their environments (including marine and freshwater environments) along with the management of commercial fisheries (including recreational fisheries and the issuing of fishing licences) are also important functions within this portfolio. Conservation protection of Crown and private land, including reversal of land degradation caused by soil erosion, pest plants and animals, salinity, native tree decline and the protection of Crown land from fire are closely related functions.\n\nAn associated function to the public land management function is the responsibility for State forests and nurseries, including administration of licences and royalties for forest products, advice, marketing and sales for forestry industries, and management of state hardwood and softwood timber plantations and the Victorian School of Forestry and Land Management.\n\nSimilarly the management of national parks, wilderness parks, and state parks is closely affiliated with the public lands management function.\n\nEnvironment protection functions encompass policy and planning for environment protection, including co-ordinating the Government's response to the Greenhouse Effect and Greenhouse monitoring, developing statewide land-use controls and regional environment plans, advising government agencies, industry and the community on environmental matters as well as the provision of facilities for marine and environmental research, e.g. the Arthur Rylah Institute for Environmental Research and the Marine Science Laboratory. (The Office of the Environment was an Associated Administrative Unit of the Department between January 1991 until October 1992.)\n\nCrown Lands (Government)\n\nThis function encompasses the control and management of crown lands assigned for use by government or for sale or development, including :\n\n land sales\n; ownership of land and buildings used for government purposes.\n\nDivision of Responsibility for Public and Government Crown Land\n\nAround 1987 the government commissioned a report into public land management which recommended the management of Crown lands be separated according to a classification which identified Public land as that which needs to be retained permanently for the \"public benefit\" because of its natural resource, environmental resource or heritage attributes and Government land as property used for the provision of goods and services by public agencies. A Bill of Parliament to authorise the transfer of Government land management, lease and sale functions to the Minister for Property and Services (VRG 69) was prepared but never tabled. In order to effect the intention of the Bill sections of the Land Act 1958 (6284) were subsequently transferred to the Minister for Property and Services via Administrative Arrangements Order (No. 58) 1988. This transfer of functions has been described as \"administratively clumsy\". Although the power to sell Crown land was transferred to Property and Services (VRG 69), the ability to lease designated government land (usually in the metropolitan area) had to be effected by the Department of Property and Services (VA 430) acting as an agent for the Department of Conservation, Forests and Lands (VA 1034). Similarly the Department of Conservation, Forests and Lands (VA 1034) retained authority for the sale of Crown land (usually in rural areas) acting as a land agent for Property and Services.\n\nThe Minister for Property and Services (VRG 69) became responsible for the sale and lease of Crown Land classified as Government land under the Government's assets sales program. Government land incorporated:\n\n declared roadways (used)\n railway permanent way and rail reserves\n sites of premises and other land use for delivery of goods and services, eg. offices, schools, laboratories, depots etc.\n\nCrown Lands (Public)\n\nThis function encompasses the control and management of crown lands generally, including :\n\n unalienated lands not assigned to be used for government purposes\n; lands and waters reserved for public use, benefit and/or enjoyment ie. public reserves\n; management of all licences and leases of unalienated crown land eg. pastoral leases, 19th century land selection, occupation licences.\n\nThe prime activity is the management of all public land including reserved and unreserved lands. The regulation of occupation and use of unreserved public land and the removal of natural materials (eg. gravel, sand and stone) is governed by leases and licences. Such land can be occupied for commercial and agricultural purposes and for recreational purposes, including coast and waterway sites occupied by boating clubs and private moorings. Unreserved lands subject to classification review are managed as public land until their classification into government or public land. Monitoring and co-ordinating the Committees of Management which directly manage land reserved for public purposes. This function does not encompass the management of National Parks post 1956 or State Forests post 1907.\n\nBackground\n\nIn the 19th century, after the initial seizure of the land from the indigenous population under presumption of the legal doctrine of \"terra nullis\", land administration focussed on survey and sale (alienation) of land and on the management of unalienated Crown land. In the 20th century the emphasis shifted from land settlement to management and conservation of public land.\n\nCrown land has traditionally consisted of land which has been reserved for particular purposes and unreserved land. Unreserved land includes land occupied under licence (including pastoral leases) and land set aside for roads. Authorised occupations include land held by lease or licence under the following categories: primary production, residential, recreational, public utility, industrial, commercial. These occupations have, since permanent white settlement, been controlled and administered by leases, licences and permits pursuant to a number of Acts, including 19th century \"pastoral lease\" legislation and \"land selection\" leases and licences. By the mid 1980's two thirds of Crown land leases and licences related to the occupation of unused roads and water frontages.\n\nIn the 19th century crown land administration included regulation of the alienation of crown land by auction and selection; settlement of disputes regarding alienation and occupation; issue of occupation licences and leases and ensuring compliance with the conditions of such licences and leases; issue of Deeds of Grant for alienated land and for reserves granted for public purposes such as schools and churches; issue of licences for pastoral occupation and determination of rents; control and management of public parks, reserves and commons, alpine resorts and; prevention of the unauthorised use or occupation of crown lands.\n\nIn the 20th century the focus of this function has been the management of the State's public land through the administration of leases and licences for unreserved land; the support, co-ordination and monitoring of committees of management responsible for over 4000 Crown reserves; and the control of pests and weeds and development of management plans for public land. Closely related functions which have developed alongside the public land function are the management of national parks, State forests and historic sites on Crown lands; soil conservation, protection and management of fisheries and wildlife, conservation of flora, research institutes, coastal management, management of botanic gardens, the National Herbarium, and zoos.\n\nPastoral Leases\n\nAfter 1829 as white settlement in New South Wales (and the Port Phillip District) grew the emphasis of land administration shifted from small-scale land grants, encouraging agricultural production, to tickets of occupancy, later to become the pastoral licence and leases of the 1830's and 1840's. In the years from first European settlement in the Port Phillip District in the early 1830s the fertile regions of Victoria had been turned into sheep runs by squatters whose possession of the land rested on simple occupancy. By 1838 practically the whole of the present Western District had been occupied and flocks numbered more than 310,000. By 1840 this number had almost doubled [Australian Encyclopaedia, Grollier, Sydney, n.d, Volume IX, p.118]\n\nAfter 1838 the occupiers of these pastoral runs in the Port Phillip District had to obtain an annual 10 licence based on stock assessment which was conducted by the Commissioners of Crown Lands. Under the provisions of 1847 Orders in Council all persons in occupation of licensed runs had to lodge applications for leases. By this legislation the pre-emptive rights of the squatters were recognised. In the newly defined Intermediate and Unsettled Districts of New South Wales, which encompassed most of the Port Phillip District except land near the townships of Melbourne and Geelong, pastoral occupants would be granted eight and fourteen year leases respectively, together with the right of prior purchase and compensation for improvements.\n\nThe leases were never granted. Instead 1852 Orders in Council c... truncated"

    "description": "Following significant machinery of government changes after the election of the first Kennett Government in October 1992, the Department of Education was established by amendment of Schedule 2 of the Public Sector Management Act 1992 (Victorian Government Gazette S 53).\n\nUnder Administrative Arrangements Order No. 114, the new Department of Education assumed responsibility for school education and post secondary education and training. These functions had hitherto been the responsibility of a number of separate, independent, departmental-level bodies, established in the period October 1991 to 1992. The new department consolidated the administration of school and post secondary education and training under one departmental body.\n\nAt the same time, the existing ministerial portfolios of School Education, and Employment, Post Secondary Education and Training were abolished, and replaced by the portfolios of Education and Tertiary Education and Training.\n\nResponsibility for employment, previously within the education portfolio, was transferred to the Department of Business and Employment (VA 3096) in December 1992, under the Minister for Industry and Employment.\n\nNote: The various departmental-level bodies responsible for the administration of education immediately prior to the establishment of VA 3098 Department of Education are not registered separately within the PROV archival control system. They are, instead, described within the registration for VA 1112 Ministry of Education and Training. For purposes of research using the PROV archival control system, researchers can assume VA 1112 Ministry of Education and Training to be the previous agency to VA 3098 Department of Education. Refer to the registration for VA 1112 for further details.\n\n\nThe Department of Education reported to the Minister for Education and the Minister for Tertiary Education and Training. The Department was divided into two main areas: the Directorate of School Education and the Office of Training and Further Education.\n\nThe Directorate of School Education was responsible for administration of all Government primary and secondary schools in Victoria. The Directorate was responsible for the employment of teachers in the Government system and the registration of new schools. Statutory bodies associated with the Directorate included the Registered Schools Board, Teachers Registration Board and the Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Board.\n\nThe Office of Training and Further Education was responsible for the administration of Government programs and services for the provision of vocational education and training and of adult, community and further education in Victoria. It was responsible for all technical and further education (TAFE) programs as well as adult and community education programs run by organisations such as the Council of Adult Education (CAE; VA 1195) and Adult Migrant Education Services (AMES). Statutory bodies associated with the Office of Training and Further Education included the Adult, Community and Further Education Board and the State Training Board.\n\nIn 1997, the Directorate of School Education was renamed the Office of Schools, and the Office of Training and Further Education was split into the Office of Higher Education and the Office of Training and Further Education. This structure remained until the Department was abolished in 1999.\n\nIn October 1999, following the election of the Bracks Government, the Department of Education was abolished and the Department of Education, Employment and Training (DEET; VA 4828) was established under Administrative Arrangements Order No. 159 (Victorian Government Gazette S 158)."

    "title": "Victorian Health System Review",
    "description": "Establishment of the Victorian Health System Review\n\nThe Victorian Health System Review was commissioned by the Minister for Health in February 1991.\n\nThis Review was the first comprehensive review of the Victorian health system for fifteen years. In that time there had been substantial changes in medical technology, medical treatments and medical practices. The Commonwealth Government's National Health Strategy, which was a fundamental examination of Australia's health system, also provided impetus for the review .\n\nThe Minister also appointed a Consultative Panel to advise and assist the Review.\n\nRole of the Victorian Health System Review\n\nOn page 18 and 19 of the Victorian Health System Review's Final Report of February 1992 the Review's terms of reference are set out. They were to:\n\n1. Examine the structure and management arrangements of the publicly funded health industry in Victoria.\n\n2. Examine how the Health Department Victoria relates to the publicly funded health agencies.\n\n3. Examine the interrelationship and linkages in the planning and management of the networks of health services ensuring continuity of care, effectiveness and efficiency among:\n\n all acute health services, including acute psychiatric, geriatric assessment and treatment and patient transport;\n community based health services of all kinds;\n residential care services of all kinds;\n rehabilitation services of all kinds;\n local government services;\n sector health service providers;\n public health programs;\n health promotion programs.\n\n4. Consult with the health industry, the community, employee and professional associations.\n\n5. Make recommendations for consideration by the Minister on appropriate changes including an implementation strategy outlining costs and benefits, and taking into account any relevant outcomes of the National Health Strategy.\n\nProcesses Carried Out by the Victorian Health System Review\n\nInitially the Review appointed a consultancy firm to provide information on the trends of healthcare administration interstate and overseas and how these may be applied to Victoria. The consultants also provided information on the financial arrangements of the Victorian health system.\n\nAn issues paper was prepared and distributed to health agencies, associations and members of the public.\n\nThe Consultative Panel appointed by the Minister met regularly with the Review and provided input to various issues addressed by the Review. The Consultative Panel also aided in the production of the Review's Interim Report.\n\nPublic meetings were convened throughout Victoria and submissions based on the issues paper were called for by the Review. The Review also had meetings with representatives of major health agencies to discuss the Review. After considering the outcome of these meetings and the submissions the Review presented an Interim Report to the Minister in August 1991. The report addressed the first two terms of reference and showed the direction the Review was taking. The Interim Report was subsequently released to the general public in November 1991.\n\nAfter the release of the Interim Report the Review convened a second round of meetings throughout Victoria. Further submissions were received addressing points raised in the Interim Report.\n\nThe Victorian Health System Review's final report was presented to the Minister in February 1992. The final report contained fifty-nine recommendations and was released to the public in July 1992. The incumbent government agreed to most of the recommendations without comment although it expressed reservations about some of the recommendations.\n\nAs at July 1993 it appears that no action has been taken to implement the Review's recommendations."

    "description": "Formation\n\nAfter the transfer of functions under the provisions of the Commonwealth Aboriginal Affairs (Arrangements with the States) Act 1973 (No.115) and the Victorian Aboriginal Affairs (Transfer of Functions) Act (No.8608) the Commonwealth assumed legislative power to administer \"aboriginal affairs\" and undertook major responsibility for funding, though State departments and Ministers continued to provide health, housing, education, employment and welfare services for Aborigines.\n\nThough an Aboriginal Affairs Unit was established within the Premier's Department (VA 2717) from 1975 to administer State sponsorship of economic development and cultural initiatives and to co-ordinate State policy relating to Aborigines, this agency has been dated from 1985 when it was first located in the Ministry of Planning and Environment (VA 1024) as this is when the co-ordination of the state policy function with the cultural heritage and aboriginal archaeology functions was first implemented.\n\nFunctions\n\nAs at 1993 the functions administered by Aboriginal Affairs, Victoria can be described as :\n\n\\* managing grants programs for Aboriginal cultural heritage and capital projects that will help Aboriginal communities by promoting economic, social and cultural development.\n\n\\* protecting aboriginal cultural heritage through aboriginal archaeology programs.\n\n\\* working with other Victorian Government agencies to ensure that the needs of Aboriginal people are reflected in policy and program development.\n\n\\* consulting with the Aboriginal community, State and Commonwealth Government agencies and local authorities.\n\nDevelopment of Aboriginal Affairs Functions during the 1980s\n\nOver time the nature of the functions carried out by Aboriginal Affairs, Victoria has altered. After 1985 the focus of the Unit was very much on the protection of aboriginal cultural heritage and the co-ordination of state policy relating to aboriginal affairs. This was achieved through the placement of the Aboriginal Affairs Unit within the Ministry for Planning and Environment (VA 1024) which also had responsibility for State archaeological functions under the Archaeological and Aboriginal Relics Preservation Act 1972. Protection of Aboriginal cultural heritage was also linked to the general cultural and heritage protection responsibilities which the Ministry undertook as part of its overall planning functions.\n\nProtection of Aboriginal Cultural Heritage and Funding of Aboriginal Capital Projects\n\nNew legislation to provide adequate protection for Aboriginal cultural material including oral history, sites and objects of religious or cultural significance was developed in conjunction with the Commonwealth during this period (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Cultural Heritage Protection Act 1987). The aim of this act is to give local Aboriginal communities control over matters relating to their cultural heritage and responsibility for public awareness of aboriginal culture. It also encourages Aboriginal communities to be directly involved in the protection of objects and places of religious, historical or cultural significance through a State and Commonwealth grants allocation process to fund various capital projects.\n\nOther cultural heritage projects undertaken during this period include the Koori Oral History Program; National Aboriginal Week activities; Aboriginal Site surveys and assessments in conjunction with local Aboriginal communities and co-operatives; and the production of cultural awareness information kits.\n\nThe Unit also had co-ordination responsibility in relation to the recommendations of the Interim Report of the Commonwealth Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody after December 1988.\n\nFunds were made available for various capital projects with the aim of encouraging Aboriginal self-management and economic independence and sponsoring cultural heritage and social development projects which were not the responsibility of other agencies. Such projects included:\n\n- purchase of Crisis Accommodation for sobering-up centres in Mildura, Morwell and Warrnambool\n- development of craft/tourism/community centre in Echuca\n- construction of administrative centre at Lake Tyers\n- improvements to tourism/community centre at Cann River\n- purchase of property for a building company in Melbourne\n- title for land and Community Centre, Bairnsdale made over to the Gippsland and East Gippsland Aboriginal Co-operative\n- purchase of land for an enterprise/cultural development in Bahmah.\n\nThe Aboriginal Land (Framlingham Forest and Lake Condah Act 1987 [Commonwealth] was also developed during this period. This Act relates to two pieces of traditional Aboriginal land which were reserved in the 19th century for mission stations. Descendants of the Aborigines who lived on these missions and still live on the same land in the 20th century obtained inalienable title to the land under the legislation.\n\nAboriginal Archaeology\n\nThe Victoria Archaeological Survey had primary responsibility for state archaeological functions, including aboriginal, historic and maritime archaeology until 1992. This agency also operated within the same division of the Ministry of Planning and Environment (VA 1024) as the Aboriginal Affairs Unit and their developmental work in the area of aboriginal archaeology was funded through the grants process administered by the Unit during this time. Particular emphasis was placed on involving and training Aborigines in the work of the Victoria Archaeological Survey.\n\nCultural Awareness officers within Aboriginal Co-operatives throughout the State were trained and funded, as was the Regional Site Officer scheme for training Aborigines in archaeological investigation and analysis, cultural resource management and community liaison.\n\nTwo committees were established in 1985 to advise whether Aboriginal skeletal remains should be preserved for scientific value or be reburied. They were the Aboriginal Affairs Committee which advised the Museum of Victoria Council on material in state collections and the Skeletal sub-committee of the Aboriginal Relics Advisory Committee which advised the Secretary for Planning and Environment on the holding and disposition of skeletal remains. In 1988-89 16 skeletal remains were returned to local aboriginal communities and relevant interstate authorities.\n\nWhen the Aboriginal Affairs Unit was moved to the Ministry of Consumer Affairs in 1990 responsibility for the Victoria Archaeological Survey had been transferred to the Minister for Conservation and Environment (VRG 94) along with other heritage protection functions, however by February 1992 responsibility for state archaeological functions were transferred to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and the Victoria Archaeological Survey was located within the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. Responsibility for the aboriginal archaeological function remains with the Aboriginal Affairs Unit, as at September 1993, though administration of maritime and historic (post-European settlement) archaeology has been split from the aboriginal archaeological function and transferred to the responsibility of the Department of Planning and Development (VA 3094).\n\nAdministrative Arrangements\n\nIn March 1985 the small support unit assisting the Premier with the aboriginal affairs function was transferred to the Ministry of Planning and Environment (VA 1024) where it operated within the Heritage and Environment Branch.\n\nBetween 1990 and August 1991 the Office of Aboriginal Affairs was situated within the Ministry of Consumer Affairs (VA 1026) following the appointment of a separately commissioned Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (who was concurrently the Minister for Consumer Affairs). From April 1990 until February 1992 State archaeological functions, including aboriginal archaeology were administered within the Department of Conservation and Environment\n(VA 3004).\n\nIn August 1991 a Department of Aboriginal Affairs (also known as Aboriginal Affairs Victoria) was established as the Department of State for the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs.\n\nAfter October 1992 the Department of Aboriginal Affairs was abolished and the Aboriginal Affairs Unit (known as Aboriginal Affairs, Victoria) was re-constituted within the Department of Health and Community Services (VA 3092 from 1992 to 1996 and VA 3970 Department of Human Services 1996 to 2002). In May 1993 maritime and historic (post-European settlement) archaeology was split from aboriginal archaeological functions and transferred to the responsibility of the Department of Planning and Development (VA 3094).\n\nIn 2002, Aboriginal Affairs Victoria, (AAV), became a division of the Department of Victorian Communities (DVC). AAV is accountable to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs for coordinating a range of policies and programs benefiting Victoria's Aboriginal communities. AAV comprises a Directorate and three Branches, Planning and Development, Heritage Services and Portfolio Services.\n\nWhen the Department of Victorian Communities was abolished on 14 August 2007, AAV was transferred to the new Department of Planning and Community Services (DPCD, VA 4838), which was established under section 10 of the Public Administration Act 2004 and published in Victorian Government Gazette No. S 189.\n\nOn 9 April 2013 the new Premier the Hon Dr Denis Napthine MP announced the transfer of Aboriginal Affairs Victoria to the Department of Premier and Cabinet under machinery-of-government changes effected under section 10(c) of the Public Administration Act 2004 (Victorian Government Gazette No. S 124). This move accompanied the abolition of DPDC and was designed to elevate Aboriginal Affairs to the heart of policy-making within government."

    "description": "The area in which St Andrews is located was, in the 1850's, known as Caledonia Diggings. In 1861 an area of the diggings was proclaimed as the town of Queenstown (Blake, Les, Place Names of Victoria, Rigby Limited, Melbourne 1977, p.58, p.224, p.234). Queenstown was subsequently proclaimed a township in 1917 (Victorian Government Gazette, 1917, p.2370). From an unknown time Queenstown was also known as St Andrews (The Victorian Municipal Directory, Arnall & Jackson, Melbourne, 1890. The 1890 edition lists Queenstown as a town in the Shire of Eltham. The 1891 edition includes the name StAndrews in brackets following the name Queenstown in the listing). Further research is required to determine the reason for the use of the two names.\n\nThe earliest records in custody for Court of Petty Sessions hearings held at Queenstown date from 1861 to 1875 (see Court of Petty Sessions Cause List Book). Queenstown was appointed as a place at which Courts of Petty Sessions could be held in 1871 (Victorian Government Gazette 8 September 1871), but no earlier gazetted appointment had been located at the time this registration was prepared. Queenstown's appointment as a place at which courts of petty sessions could be held was revoked in 1902 (Victorian Government Gazette 21 May 1902, p.1763).\n\nSt Andrews was appointed as a place at which a Court of Mines for the Castlemaine Mining District could be held in 1858 (Victorian Government Gazette 12 January 1858. p.83). That appointment was revoked in 1869 and subsequent matters before the Court of Mines for the St Andrews Division of the Castlemaine District were heard at Heidelberg (Victorian Government Gazette 2 July 1869, p.950).\n\nThis agency's date range is therefore determined to be 1858 to 1902.\n\nCourts held include:\n\n Court of Mines\n Court of Petty Sessions\n Licensing Court\n\nLocation of Records\n\nFor records of this agency, see list of series below. See also List of Holdings, section 2.214.0.\n\n\nFile Note\n\nAccording to Les Blake's Place Names of Victoria St Andrews was previously known as Queenstown and Caledonia. The evidence of the contents of the volume containing VPRS 8735/P1, 8736/P1 and 8737/P1 does not support this position. For the period 1861 to 1870 that unit records matters for two separate courts known as Caledonia and Queenstown. From 1870 Caledonia no longer appears but Yarra Flats commences in 1870 and continues to 1879. Within that period there are only two other entries for Queenstown. The Victorian Municipal Directories for the period (earliest consulted was dated 1888) includes, in reference to Queenstown, that it is accessible by coach via Caledonia. Caledonia is therefore a separate location to Queenstown."

The Melbourne Zoological Gardens were the first to be established in Australia. The first collections were housed in the Richmond Paddock opposite the Melbourne Botanic Garden. In 1861 the title was changed to the \"Acclimatisation Society of Victoria\", in 1870 to the \"Zoological and Acclimatisation Society of Victoria\", the prefix \"Royal\" being added in 1910. The animals were transferred to the present site in Royal Park in 1862. Although acclimatisation was one of the objects during the first decade at Royal Park, the efforts of the Society were gradually directed towards developing the Gardens and acquiring animals for exhibition purposes.\n\nEstablishment of the Zoological Board of Victoria and disbandment of the Society\n\nThe Royal Zoological and Acclimatisation Society of Victoria controlled the Zoological Gardens until 1937 when financial difficulties were encountered and the Society requested the Victorian Government to assume responsibility for the Zoological Gardens and its extensive collections. As a result the Zoological Gardens Act 1936 appointed the Zoological Board of Victoria (VA 572), a statutory body, on which the society was represented until the final disbandment of the Royal Zoological and Acclimatisation Society of Victoria in the 1950s.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nFor records of this agency see list of series below.

Nothing came of this order, but several other sites were suggested and in 1845 Superintendent La Trobe chose the slopes of a gully leading down to the Yarra River near the grounds of Government House. Here John Arthur, the first Curator of the gardens, appointed in 1846, fenced a five acre paddock and laid it out in flower-beds and plantations. Both he (1846-49) and John Dallachy (1849-57) paid attention to the introduction of exotic plants, and permitted the gardens to be used for horticultural shows. In 1857 a new office was created; Ferdinand Mueller who had been Government Botanist since January 1853, was made Director of the Gardens. He established close relations with similar institutions throughout the world and effected important exchanges of plants, re-arranged and extended the grounds and paid particular attention to the native vegetation. He also devoted part of the area to plant-beds showing a scientific arrangement of plants in their natural orders, and established a national herbarium. \"Mueller's view of a botanic garden was as a scientific and educational institution and his development of the garden reflected this conviction\" [Annual Report Royal Botanic Gardens Melbourne, 1993, p.5]\n\nIn 1873 it was decided to divide the positions of director and Government Botanist and Mueller was deprived of the former office, the directorship passed to William Robert Guilfoyle, who during his long term (1873-1909) extended the gardens by over 30 acres and increased the number of species represented. \"With his radically different concept of a botanic garden as a place to provide inspiring views and to display plants artistically, and influenced by English landscape design, Guilfoyle totally redesigned the Botanic Gardens.\" [op cit] Also undertaken during this period was the deepening and straightening of the course of the Yarra which allowed an extension of the garden area, taking in the old river-channel and adding it to the existing lake.\n\nIn 1924 the offices of Director and Government Botanist were again united and the National Herbarium of Victoria was again brought into association with the Gardens, having been separated since Mueller's removal from the directorship in 1873.\n\nThe Cranbourne Botanic Garden was initiated in 1970 with the purchase of land by the Government for the purpose of establishing a native botanic garden. Cranbourne was opened to the public in 1991."

The Committee comprised twelve members of whom no more than six could be appointed by the Council and no more than ten appointed by the Assembly.\n\nAs a joint investigatory committee, the Social Development Committee could inquire into matters referred to it by a joint resolution of both Houses or by order of the Governor-In-Council. It might also inquire, consider or report to Parliament on any annual report or document relevant to its functions laid before either House. Recommendations made by the Social Development Committee (and any other joint investigatory committee other than the Public Bodies Review Committee) were not automatically accepted by Parliament. The responsible Minister, however, was required to table a report stating action to be taken regarding the recommendations within six months of the tabling of the report.\n\nSocial Development Investigations\n\nThe Committee conducted a number of investigations on a range of matters including a number of community issues which were particularly contentious at the time. Road safety issues were a particular concern of the Committee and at any one time during its existence, an inquiry was being conducted into some aspect of road safety. Examples of Committee investigations include:\n\nRoad Safety in Victoria (1982-1984)\nCertification of Needs Legislation (1983-1984)\nPsychologists Bill 1984 (1984-1985)\nFuture Use of Willsmere Hospital (1985)\nOptions for Dying with Dignity (1986-1987)\nChild Pedestrian and Bicycle Safety (1986-1987)\nAlcohol Abuse and Road Safety (1987-1988)\nRole and Welfare of Companion Animals in Society (1987-1989)\nStrategies to Deal with the Issue of Community Violence (1988-1989)\nMotorcycle Safety in Victoria (1990-1992)\nMental Disturbance and Community Safety (1989-1992)\n\nAbolition of the Committee\n\nThe Social Development Committee was abolished following the 1992 election by the Parliamentary Committees (Amendment) Act 1992 (No.64).

It was originally constituted under the Joint Select Committee (Road Safety) Act 1967 No.7602. The purpose of the committee was to:\n\n \"conduct an inquiry into and report and make recommendations to the Council and the Assembly upon the question of road safety in Victoria, and in particular -\n\n (a) to specify the accident countermeasures which, in the opinion of the committee, have been proved to reduce accidents and their consequences;\n\n (b) to specify the accident counter measures so proved which are not at present being used in Victoria and which in the opinion of the committee should be introduced into Victoria;\n\n (c) to consider whether there are any counter measures not being used in Victoria which the committee believes would be likely to achieve a worthwhile reduction in accidents;\n\n (d) to report on research the committee believes should be undertaken by the State -\n (i) to obtain more knowledge of accidents; and\n (ii) to assess the value of present or proposed accident counter measures; and\n\n (e) to report on any other matters which appear relevant to the inquiry.\" [S.4 (a)-(e)].\n\nAs the tenure of the Committee was limited to the life of the Parliament, it was reconstituted by further Joint Select Committee (Road Safety) Acts in 1970, 1973, 1976 and 1979. The Committee comprised eight members of whom four (and by 1979 three) could be appointed by the Council with four (and by 1979 five) appointed by the Assembly.\n\nAbolition of the Committee\n\nThe Road Safety Committee was abolished following the 1982 election by the Parliamentary Committees (Joint Investigatory Committees) Act 1982 (No.9765). (Under this Act joint select committees also became known as joint investigatory committees). Parliamentary investigations into road safety were subsequently undertaken by the Social Development Committee (VA 3126). It also completed the final inquiry commenced by the Road Safety Committee.\n\nFollowing the 1992 election, the Social Development Committee was abolished and another Road Safety Committee was established (VA 3130).\n\nLocation of Records\n\nRecords of the Road Safety Committee I are listed below. Papers pertaining to its final investigation have been transferred as part of the records of the Social Development Committee which completed the investigation.\n\n\\*\\*Special Access Conditions\\*\\*\n\nAlthough records transferred from this agency are available for public inspection, special access conditions apply. The records have been transferred to the Public Record Office on the understanding that they remain the property of the Parliament of Victoria. Parliamentary records are transferred on condition that all requests for access will be referred to the Clerk of the Legislative Council/Legislative Assembly as appropriate, for determination in each case.\n\nApplication to inspect the records should be made to the appropriate officer and written authorisation must be presented at the Public Record Office Search Rooms before records can be made available for inspection."

    "title": "Metropolitan Town Planning Commission",
    "description": "Functions\n\nThe State Government became involved with land use planning in the 1920s in response to pressure from town planners for improved land use and better co-ordination of services. Municipalities were given power to zone land for residential use in 1921.\n\nIn 1922 the Victorian Government established the Metropolitan Town Planning Commission (MTPC) to recommend better ways of guiding Melbourne's development. This was the first attempt on the part of the State Government to tackle some form of strategic planning. The Metropolitan Town Planning Commission recommended development of planning schemes with statutory force to be administered by municipalities. Its work included research and recommendations on urban development and town planning.\n\nIn 1929 the Commission's report (concerning zoning, transport, recreation, harbours and rivers, building regulation, and conservation) highlighted problems of severe traffic congestion, deficiencies in recreational open space and the haphazard inter-mingling of land uses. It strongly recommended land use zoning as a means of preventing the \"wasteful allocation of land\" and protecting property values. Although a model land use scheme was produced, the Commission proposed that local councils should prepare such schemes under the supervision and co-ordination of a local town planning authority which would ensure rational planning which would encompass not only land use zoning but also traffic and service provision, civic design and the conservation of historic buildings.\n\nIts 1929 report provided a model for those urging government to enact a statutory planning regime and for those municipalities undertaking land use zoning up to 1944.\n\nEstablishment\n\nIn December 1922 an Act was passed establishing the Metropolitan Town Planning Commission. The Commissioners, appointed in an honorary capacity in 1923, were charged with providing advice on town planning in the Melbourne and metropolitan area. The Commission was financed by metropolitan municipalities, the Victorian Railways (VA 2876), Melbourne and Metropolitan Tramways Board (VA 2694), Melbourne Harbor Trust (see VA 1426) and the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works (M.M.B.W.) (VA 1007) The Commissioners presented their final report in 1929, stressing the need for legislation, but a long period of inaction followed until the passage of the Town and Country Planning Act in 1944.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nSee List of Holdings 1985, section 3.15.4."

    "description": "In a proclamation dated 24 December 1935 and in response to a request from producers, chicory was proclaimed a commodity under the provisions of the Marketing of Primary Products Act 1935 (No.4337).\n\nUnder the provisions of two Orders in Council dated 8 April 1936, the Chicory Marketing Board was appointed. On the 3 August 1936 the Governor in Council made regulations cited as the \"Chicory Marketing Board Regulations 1936\" which stipulated the administrative and operational guidelines for the Board. The Board consisted of one person appointed by the Governor in Council and the other members were the elected representatives of the producers. The regulations stated that the Board meet \"... on such dates, at such places, and at such times as the Chairperson may in his discretion from time to time determine\". It is unclear how often the Board actually convened, as no minutes recording the meetings have been located.\n\nAfter the Minister for Agriculture met with the Board in May 1976, he appointed a Manager in order to ensure the continuity of the Board's activities until it could be determined what would eventuate for the industry in the next two or three years. The Acting Minister of Agriculture dissolved the Chicory Marketing Board by proclamation on 28 January, 1981.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nFor records of this agency, see the list of series below. The records in custody were moved to the Department of Agriculture from the Board's Liquidators office in 1985 and transferred to the Public Record Office in 1994. It was not possible to establish whether the records transferred were the only records created by the Board.\n\nAlthough the Chicory Marketing Board regulations required the Secretary to keep minutes, no records have been located.\n\nInformation concerning the Board can also be located within the record keeping system of the Department of Agriculture (VA 618).

    "description": "Establishment and Function\n\nThe Law Reform Committee was established under the Parliamentary Committees (Amendment) Act 1992 (No.64). The purpose of the committee was to:\n\n \" (a) to inquire into, consider and report to the Parliament where required or permitted so to do by or under this Act, on any proposal, matter or thing concerned with legal, constitutional or Parliamentary reform or with the administration of justice but excluding any proposal, matter or thing concerned with the joint standing orders of the Parliament or the standing orders of a House of Parliament or the rules of practice of a House of the Parliament;\n\n (b) to examine, report and make recommendations to the Parliament in respect of any proposal or matter relating to law reform in Victoria where required so to do by or under this Act, in accordance with the terms of reference under which the proposal or matter is referred to the Committee. \" [new S. 4E].\n\nThe Committee effectively replaced the Legal and Constitutional Committee (VA 3141).\n\nJoint investigatory committees\n\nThe Law Reform Committee is a joint investigatory committee of the Legislative Assembly and Legislative Council. As such it may comprise no more than nine members of which no more than two members could be appointed by the Council and no less than two appointed by the Assembly.\n\nAs a joint investigatory committee, the Law Reform Committee could inquire into matters referred to it by a resolution of either House or by order of the Governor-In-Council. It may also inquire, consider or report to Parliament on any annual report or document relevant to its functions laid before either House. Recommendations made by the Law Reform Committee (and any other joint investigatory committee other than the Public Bodies Review Committee) are not automatically accepted by Parliament. The appropriate responsible Minister, however, is required to table a report stating action to be taken regarding these recommendations within 6 months of the tabling of the report.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nThere are no records of the Law Reform Committee in the custody of the Public Record Office.\n\n\\*\\*Special Access Conditions\\*\\*\n\nAlthough records transferred from Parliament are available for public inspection, special access conditions apply.

The Board also became responsible for the:\n\n- registration of midwives in 1929 with the passing of the Midwives Act 1928 (No 3587). (Midwives were previously registered by the Midwives Board - VA 3143).\n\n- registration of mental nurses in 1950 with the proclamation of the Nurses and Midwives Act 1950 (No 5470).\n\nPrior to the establishment of the Board, Victorian nurses were not subject to any compulsory training or registration. However, private organisations such as the Royal Victorian Trained Nurses' Association did register nurses who completed and passed training in one of their training schools.\n\nFormation and Membership of the Board\n\nThe original Act provided for a Board of seven, (one of whom was appointed by the Governor in Council to be chairman). Membership consisted of a ministerial nominee, a medical practitioner, two registered nurses, one member representing persons being trained in nursing, and two nominees representing hospitals having a General Training School. Subsequent Acts increased membership and provided representation for midwives (1936), the legal profession (1940) and mental and mental deficiency nurses (1950).\n\nFunctions\n\nThe Board was established as a policy-making body, responsible for the regulation of nursing matters. It was responsible for the establishment of standards, the co-ordination of education and the registration of nurses and midwives. (To be eligible for registration, nurses and midwives were required to undergo training in training schools approved by the Board and to pass the prescribed examinations).\n\nIn performing these functions, the Board:\n\n - registered nurses in many of the fields of nursing and from 1929 registered midwives.\n\n - issued, annulled, suspended or restored registration and certificates of registration and judged any disputable cases.\n\n- regulated the content of training courses, determined the duration of courses and managed examinations.\n\n- approved or withdrew approval allowing a hospital to be a general training school or to conduct a special course in nursing.\n\n- arranged reciprocal recognition of training and qualifications with other nursing organisations within Australia and overseas.\n\n- published the register of nurses in the Victorian Government Gazette.\n\nAbolition\n\nWith the proclamation of the Nurses Act 1956 (No.6035) on 1 March 1958 the Victorian Nursing Council (VA 1352) was established. The Council assumed responsibility for functions previously administered by the Board, and expanded its activities to include the registration of all nurses and the investigation of various matters related to nursing.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nFor records of this agency see list of series below."

    "description": "The Beechworth Mining District was one of six mining districts established by the Governor-in-Council on 4 January 1858 under the provisions of An Act for Amending the Laws Relating to the Goldfields (21 Vic no.32).\n\nThe District was further divided into seven divisions: Spring Creek, Snake Valley, Three Mile Creek, Buckland, Woolshed, Yackandandah and Omeo. The boundaries of each of these divisions and of the whole district are described in the Governor-in-Council's proclamation printed in the Government Gazette, 5 January 1858, pages 3-5.\n\nThe number, boundaries and names of the divisions within the Beechworth District changed several times throughout the nineteenth and twentieth century. Annual reports of the Mines Department and reports of the Goldfields Commissioners show that by 1890 there were seventeen divisions within the district and that the number fell to fourteen by 1917, twelve by 1934 and six by 1967. Similarly the role of Mining Districts diminished as the administration of mining became more centralised.\n\nIn 1975 the remaining functions of the Beechworth Mining District were transferred, along with those of all other districts, to the centralised control of the Mines Department.\n\nFor further information about the operations of mining districts and the functions of district officials see the Inventory of Agencies for VRG 25 Mining Districts.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nIn addition to those records listed below, see List of Holdings second edition, 1985, section 9.0.0. and section 4.0.0.\n\nBeechworth Court of Mines Records\n\nRecords attributed to the Beechworth Mining District include records created by district officials such as Registrars and Wardens. A Court of Mines also operated in each District. Although each District had only one Court of Mines, that court may have sat at several localities within the District at various times. Records of the Beechworth Court of Mines have been determined to be court records rather than administrative records of the mining district. Accordingly they have been attributed to the local courts at which the Beechworth Court of Mines sat."

    "description": "The Council of the Museum of Victoria was established on 1 July 1983 by s10(1) of the Museums Act 1983 (No. 9903/1983). It was the successor in law to \"the Building Trustees established under the State Library National Gallery National Museum and Institute of Applied Science Act 1960, the Council of the Science Museum of Victoria established under the Science Museum of Victoria Act 1970 and the National Museum of Victoria Council established under the National Museum of Victoria Council Act 1970\" (ss 32 and 33(3) Museums Act 1983).\n\nThe Director of the Museum was appointed by the Governor in Council on the recommendation of the Minister for the Arts, and was the Chief Executive Officer of the Council (Museum of Victoria Annual Report 1988-89, p5).\n\nThe original functions of the Council and the Museum are subject to research. The Council became responsible for administering the Royal Exhibition Building and Exhibition land on 1 April 1996, when the body corporate known as The Exhibition Trustees was dissolved (s37 Museums Act 1983 (No. 9903/1983), inserted by s45 Miscellaneous Acts (Omnibus Amendments) Act 1995 (No. 100/1995). The Council was made successor in law to The Exhibition Trustees (s38 Museums Act 1983), also inserted by s45 Miscellaneous Acts (Omnibus Amendments) Act).\n\nIn February 1997 the Council of the Museum of Victoria was replaced by the Museums Board of Victoria (s10 Museums Act 1983, as amended by s39 Arts Institutions (Amendment) Act 1996 (No. 61/1996). The Board was to be taken as the same body as the Council, despite the change of name (s47 Museums Act, inserted by s66 Arts Institutions (Amendment) Act). The Board comprised from seven to eleven members appointed by the Governor in Council. Appointments were for renewable periods of up to three years (s11 Museums Act, as amended by s40 Arts Institutions (Amendment) Act). The Board's functions were to, subject to the control of the Minister,\n\n-- control, manage, operate, promote, develop and maintain the Museum of Victoria\n-- control, manage, operate, promote, develop and maintain the Exhibition land...\n-- develop and maintain the State collections of natural sciences, indigenous culture, social history and science and technology\n-- exhibit material from those collections for the purposes of education and entertainment\n-- promote use of those collections for scientific research\n-- promote the use of the Museum's resources for education in Victoria\n-- research, present and promote issues of public relevance and benefit in... the origins, development and diversity of cultures in Australia and adjacent lands; the natural environment; [and] science and technology and their applications to the development of society\n-- act as a repository for specimens upon which scientific studies have been made or which may have special cultural or historical significance\n-- provide leadership to museums in Victoria\n-- advise the Minister on matters relating to museums, and co-ordination of museum services, in Victoria\n-- carry out such other functions appropriate to museums and the Exhibition land as the Minister from time to time directs (ss22A and 23 Museums Act, as amended).\n\nThe Ministerial advisory function had previously been carried out by Museums Advisory Board, which was abolished at the same time as the Council (s46 Museums Act, inserted by s65 Arts Institutions (Amendment) Act; \"Arts Institutions (Amendment) Act Proclaimed,\" News Release from the Office of the Premier and Minister for the Arts, 6 February 1997).\n\nThe Museums Board of Victoria employed Museum employees in its own right. Prior to the commencement of the Board, Museum employees had been employed in the public service.\n\nFrom early 1998 the oganisation began to identify itself as Museum Victoria (Museum Victoria Annual Report 1997 -- 1998 p2).\n\nUntil March 1991 the Museum comprised a single campus, in premises shared with VA 2923 State Library of Victoria. Responsibility for managing the premises and some other administrative tasks were undertaken in conjunction with the State Library. Details of the administrative relationship between the Musuem and the State Library are subject to research. From March 1991 the Division of Science and Technology was housed at Sciencworks, on the site of the former Melbourne Metropolitan Board of Works pumping station, in Spotswood (Museum of Victoria Annual Report 1991-92, p15). In November 1998 the Immigration Museum and Hellenic Antiquities Museum commenced at the Old Customs House, in Flinders Street Melbourne, and in October 2000 the Museum's other operations moved to the newly constructed Melbourne Museum, in Carlton Gardens."

    "description": "Establishment and Functions\n\nProvisions for the election of Market Commissioners were established in 1839 by An Act to authorise the establishment of Markets in certain Towns in the colony of New South Wales and for the appointment of commissioners to manage the same (3 Vic. No.19).\n\nThe Act empowered the Police Magistrate of a Town to hold a public meeting if twenty-five or more signatures had been received calling for the establishment of a market.\n\nIf the meeting had a resolution calling for the establishment of a market then the Police Magistrate would advise the Colonial Secretary of the resolution. The Governor, on the recommendation of the Executive Council would then approve the establishment of a market. Notification would be through the New South Wales Government Gazette.\n\nThe Governor, on the advice of the Executive Council, could fix the number of Market Commissioners in proportion to the town population. If the town had a population of more than four thousand then the Governor could divide the town into wards (not to be less than three) and have at least two commissioners for each ward.\n\nThe Market Commissioners were to be elected from proprietors of land and householders within the town limits. The voters were householders or occupiers of houses valued at more than 20 pounds and proprietors of land or buildings to the value of 200 pounds. The Market Commissioners were to hold office for three years.\n\nThe Market Commissioners could make rules and regulations in respect of markets and make alterations to these rules and regulations if necessary. The Commissioners could also approve designated marketplaces and could receive tolls for those markets.\n\nIn Melbourne the first market was established on the 22 October 1841, at which time Melbourne was divided into four wards for the purpose of electing Market Commissioners. The Commissioners held their first meeting on the 8 November 1841.\n\nThe four wards created to elect the Market Commissioners were used as the basis for the original four wards (Bourke, Gipps, LaTrobe, Lonsdale) of the Town of Melbourne (VA 511).\n\nTransfer of Powers\n\nFollowing the creation of the Town of Melbourne in 1842 (6 Vic. No.7) the powers of the Market Commissioners were transferred to the Town of Melbourne Council.\n\nSections 71 and 72 of the Melbourne Incorporation Act (6 Vic. No.7) deal with the transfer of the Market Commissioners powers to the newly formed council.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nThe only identified records of the Market Commissioners in Public Record Office Victoria custody are the minutes of meetings held between the 8 November 1841 and 20 December 1842. These records are found at the front of the first unit of VPRS 4030 Markets Committee Minutes of Meetings.\n\nIt is possible that correspondence from or regarding the Market Commissioners may be found in the custody of the Archives Authority of New South Wales (such as Colonial Secretary or Governors Inward Correspondence), but further research is required to establish if this is the case."

It could also inquire, consider or report to Parliament on any annual report or document relevant to its functions laid before either House. Recommendations made by the Natural Resources and Environment Committee (and any other joint investigatory committee other than the Public Bodies Review Committee) were not automatically accepted by Parliament. The appropriate responsible Minister, however, was required to table a report stating action to be taken regarding these recommendations within 6 months of the tabling of the report.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nRecords of the Natural Resources and Environment Committee are listed below.\n\n\\*\\*Special Access Conditions\\*\\*\n\nAlthough records transferred from this agency are available for public inspection, special access conditions apply.

The change was published in the Government Gazette Special No. 11 (S11) on 1 February 1995. The new Department was assigned all Acts from the Department of Energy and Minerals (VA 3035) and the Department of Agriculture (VA 2649), under Administrative Arrangements Order No. 143 (Victorian Government Gazette No. S 11, 1 February 1995).\n\nThe Department of Agriculture, Energy and Minerals assumed responsibility for all functions from the former Department of Energy and Minerals (VA 3035) and the Department of Agriculture (VA 2649). The Department reported to the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Energy and Minerals.\n\nStructure and functions of Department\n\nAgriculture Victoria\nAgriculture Victoria was responsible for all agriculture-related functions in Victoria, including provision of guidelines and standards relating to agriculture; veterinary services; animal welfare; quarantine and animal and plant inspection; development of sustainable agriculture; and development of policies relating to agriculture and rural affairs in Victoria. Agriculture Victoria was divided into five Regions to allow co-ordination of integrated agricultural services and to facilitate research, enquiries and regulatory activities within that Region.\n\nEnergy and Minerals Victoria\nEnergy and Minerals Victoria was responsible for the development of Victoria's energy and minerals markets through exploration, administration and regulation. The Energy Policy Division was responsible for the development of policies which assisted the restructuring and privatisation of public sector utilities (such as the Gas and Fuel Corporation; VA 1040, and the State Electricity Commission; VA 1002) which commenced in 1993. The Resources Development Division was responsible for the regulation and development of Victoria's mineral, petroleum and other earth resources. It was responsible for the administration of the Mineral Resources Development Act 1990.\n\nFollowing significant machinery of government changes after the re-election of the Kennett Government in April 1996, the Department of Agriculture, Energy and Minerals was abolished under amendment of Schedule One of the Public Sector Management Act 1992. This amendment was published in the Victorian Government Gazette No. S 33, 3 April 1996. Most functions were transferred to the new Department of Natural Resources and the Environment (VA 3972) by Administrative Arrangements Order No.150 (Victorian Government Gazette No. S 33, 3 April 1996).

    "description": "History\n\nAccording to the Secretary's report of 1972 (which may be found in VPRS 9595/P1, unit 1, Outward Letter Books) the Secretariat was formed on a trial basis in 1962 with the costs of the Secretariat to be shared among the capital cities of Australia. At the Lord Mayors' of Capital Cities Conference in 1963 the value of the Secretariat (in research, and to facilitate representations to governments on matters of mutual interest to the capital cities of Australia) was acknowledged, and it was resolved that a Secretary should be appointed, and that the Secretariat should be based in Melbourne (in the minutes, 22-26 October 1963, item 29).\n\nThe role of the Secretariat was defined at the 1964 Lord Mayors' of Capital Cities Conference, 20-23 October 1964. The Secretary was to receive submissions in relation to the conference, to prepare papers and materials in relation to the conference and to make recommendations to the conference if desired, and to submit a report on important matters of interest to the metropolitan areas of the capital cities of Australia for the previous twelve months.\n\nFrom 1966 onwards the minutes of conferences were created under the auspices of the Australian Capital Cities' Secretariat.\n\nThe most recent records of the Australian Capital Cities' Secretariat that were held by the City of Melbourne (prior to their transfer to the Public Records Office Victoria in 1995) were Outward Letter books dated December 1980. As at 1995 it is not known if the body continued."

It commenced in February 1994 when Sinclair Knight and Partners (known as Sinclair Knight) merged with Merz Australia Pty Limited.\n\nSinclair Knight had commenced as a partnership in 1963, incorporated in 1972 and later merged with a number of Australian and international companies. Merz had commmenced in Australia as a branch of Merz and mc Lelland, a United Kingdom firm of consulting engineers, in 1954. Merz Australia incorporated in 1988, still as part of Merz and McLelland.\n\nSinclair Knight Merz was one of the companies which purchased aspects of VA 4234 Rural Water Corporation's engineering consultancy arm, the Hydro Technology Division, when the Corporation was broken up in 1995. Under the terms of the sale agreement, the purchasers were entitled to take custody of relevant Rural Corporation Records pending completion of the relevant projects. On completion of the projects the records were to be returned to public custody. By August 2001 Sinclair Knight Merz had transferred several consignments of records to Public Record Office Victoria and at least one consignment to VA 3757 Goulburn-Murray Rural Water Authority. It is possible that Sinclair Knight Merz has retained other public records.\n\nSinclair Knight Merz's Australian Company Number is 001 024 095."

According to Australian Archives Australian National Guide to Archival Materials data base (ANGAM), SMEC was established in 1970 by a Commonwealth Act, the Snowy Mountains Engineering Act 1970 (39/1970). SMECs functions included providing engineering advice in relation to water transmission and hydroelectricity. SMECs predecessor was the engineering component of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Authority. SMEC became a public company in 1989 pursuant to the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation (Conversion into Public Company) Act 1989 (Commonwealth). SMEC Ltd, as it was known after 1989, was sold in 1993 pursuant to the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation Sale Act 1993 (Commonwealth).\n\nThe company purchased the Dams Design, Dams Surveillance and Project Management businesses from VA 2338 Rural Water Corporation in 1995. The purchase occurred within the context of a restructuring of the Victorian rural water supply industry. The restructuring meant that the Rural Water Corporation was abolished, several new agencies were created and some functions were privatised.\n\nPrior to the purchase, the Rural Water Corporation had acquired Dams Design, Dams Surveillance and Project Management services through its HydroTechnology Division. Other components of the HydroTechnology business were sold to VA 3748 Sinclair Knight Mertz and VA 3752 Thiess Environmental Services.\n\nFurther Information\n\nMore information about SMEC Victoria Pty Ltd and associated companies will be available from the Australian Securities Commission. Information about relevant Commonwealth government agencies is available from the Australian Archives. Some relevant Australian Company Numbers and Commonwealth Agency numbers are listed below. Australian Company Numbers are issued by the Australian Securities Commission to register companies, while Commonwealth Agency numbers are issued by Australian Archives to register Commonwealth government agencies.\n\nAustralian Company Numbers\n\n\\* SMEC Victoria Pty Ltd: A.C.N. 069 699 467.\n\\* SMEC Ltd: A.C.N. 008 654 224.\n\nCommonwealth Agency Numbers\n\n\\* SMEC Ltd: CA 3568\n\\* Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Authority: CA 75."

The boundaries of each of these divisions and of the whole district are described in the Governor-in-Council's proclamation printed in the Government Gazette, 5 January 1858, pages 3-5.\n\nThe Sandhurst Mining District was abolished and the Bendigo Mining District established in its place on 10 October 1898 (see Government Gazette, 14 October 1898).\n\nThe number, boundaries and names of the divisions and subdivisions within the Bendigo District changed several times throughout the nineteenth and twentieth century. Annual reports of the Mines Department and reports of the Goldfields Commissioners show that by 1890 there were five divisions and subdivisions within the district and that the number fell to three by 1917, and two by 1934.\n\nOver time the role of Mining Districts diminished as the administration of mining became more centralised. In 1975 the remaining functions of the Bendigo Mining District were transferred, along with those of all other districts, to the centralised control of the Mines Department.\n\nFor further information about the operations of mining districts and the functions of district officials see the Inventory of Agencies for VRG 25 Mining Districts.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nIn addition to those records listed below, see List of Holdings second edition, 1985, section 9.0.0. and section 4.0.0.\n\nBendigo District Court of Mines Records\n\nRecords attributed to the Bendigo Mining District include records created by district officials such as Registrars and Wardens. A Court of Mines also operated in each District. Although each District had only one Court of Mines, that court may have sat at several localities within the District at various times. Records of the Bendigo District Court of Mines have been determined to be court records rather than administrative records of the mining district. Accordingly they have been attributed to the local courts at which the Bendigo District Court of Mines sat."

    "description": "Establishment\n\nIn 1965, the department opened the first stage of a new youth training centre at Malmsbury. On completion, the centre accommodated up to 150 male trainees in the 17-20-year age group in an open- to medium-security facility.\n\nMalmsbury Youth Training Centre provided a secure residential facility and became the main centre for the department's Work Release Program for trainees. In 1976, Malmsbury provided supervision and support to some young offenders in transition to parole.\n\nDuring the mid-1970s, dormitory-style accommodation was converted to smaller units with bedroom accommodation, enhancing classification and treatment options.\n\nIn 1985, statewide redevelopment was underway towards de-centralisation and community-based alternatives, prioritising services for pre-adolescent and adolescent wards and offenders held in Turana, Winlaton and Baltara. These institutions continued to operate in the short term, but as youth training centres providing programs for young people sentenced to detention.\n\nMalmsbury was considered by Community Services Victoria to be an \"(adult) youth training centre, this alternative to adult prison is termed a 'dual track' system and is unique to Victoria. It means that young offenders receive a Children's Court disposition rather than a prison sentence from the adult court.\n\nLater years\n\nThe Children and Young Persons Act 1989 required that the provision of services for children and young people on protective orders be separated from those provided to young offenders in custody. The Act established different divisions in the Children's Court to completely separate child protection matters from criminal custodial matters. Prior to this, the Malmsbury Youth Training Centre accommodated wards of the state as well as young people remanded or sentenced for criminal matters. Around this time the name of Malmsbury changed from a Youth Training Centre to a Juvenile Justice Centre, which reflected the change of terminology defined in the new legislation (see Legislation and record keeping).\n\nFrom 1994, following the closure of Langi Kal Kal, Winlaton and Turana, three remaining Victorian centres provided custodial services for young offenders: Malmsbury Juvenile Justice Centre, Melbourne Juvenile Justice Centre and the Parkville Youth Residential Centre.\n\nMalmsbury became Victoria's main facility for 17 to 21 year old offenders serving a custodial order.\n\nIn 1994, a major redevelopment of Malmsbury commenced to consolidate all the youth justice centre functions for the 17-21 age group on a single site, and improve the centre's safety, security and program capacity\n\nIn December 1997, the new 75-bed centre at Malmsbury was opened. Malmsbury became Victoria's main facility for 17 to 21 year old offenders serving a custodial order.\n\n\nIn July 2015, a new 45-bed facility opened at the Malmsbury Youth Justice Precinct. The $46 million complex was built next to existing facilities but had a higher level of security and featured three new residential wings, administration offices, an educational and recreational area as well as a visitor room.\n\nMalmsbury remains an operational facility for sentenced youth. It accommodates young men aged 18-21 years who have been sentenced to a youth justice custodial order by an adult court in Victoria. Young men live in a mixture of low- and high-security residential units.\n\nChange of Name\n\nThe Children, Youth and Families Act 2005 repealed most of the Children and Young Persons Act 1989. On 23 April 2007, the name of the young offender programs changed from 'juvenile justice' to 'youth justice'. The Malmsbury Juvenile Justice Centre was renamed the Malmsbury Youth Justice Centre (MYJC).\n1n 2009 the Malmsbury Youth Justice Centre was renamed Malmsbury Youth Justice Precinct.\n\nLegislation and record keeping\n\nThe Children and Young Persons Act 1989 replaced the terms 'ward of state' (introduced by the Neglected Children's Act 1887) and 'trainee' (introduced by the Social Welfare Act 1960), with the new term, 'children in need of protection'. The old terminology was phased out in the 1990s, whereafter both child protection cases and sentenced young people were classified as 'clients'.\nYoung people who entered into the youth justice system before implementation of the 1989 Act, kept their trainee case history files, and not the later Client Relationship Information System institutional files (JJ CRIS prefix). This explains why the older records continued until the late 1990s, well after the terminology had changed."

    "description": "Description:\n\nFollowing significant machinery of government changes after the re-election of the Kennett Government in April 1996, the Department of Human Services (DHS) was established by amendment to Schedule 1 of the Public Sector Management Act 1992.\n\nUnder Administrative Arrangements Order No.150, effective 3 April 1996 (published in the Victorian Government Gazette No. S 33, 3 April 1996), the Department of Human Services assumed all functions of the Department of Health and Community Services (VA 3092), the Office of Housing from the Department of Planning and Development (VA 3094) and Youth Affairs from the Department of Business and Employment (VA 3096).\n\nStructure and functions:\n\nAt its creation, DHS reported to the following ministers: Health; Aged Care; Housing; Aboriginal Affairs; Youth and Community Services.\n\nThe Department comprised four corporate divisions: Corporate Services; Change Management; Corporate Strategy; Portfolio Services. DHS also had seven functional divisions: Aboriginal Affairs; Office of Housing; Disability Services; Acute Health; Aged, Community and Mental Health Division; Public Health; Youth and Family Services.\n\nDHS was divided into nine geographic regions which were responsible for service provision and administration in that region. There were four metropolitan regions: Northern Metropolitan; Southern Metropolitan; Eastern Metropolitan; Western Metropolitan. There were also five rural regions: Barwon South West; Gippsland; Grampians; Hume; Loddon Mallee.\n\nIn January 1995 the predecessor Department of Health and Community Services published the report Victoria's Health to 2050. This report identified the need for major change in provision of acute care services and in February 1995 a Metropolitan Hospitals Planning Board was established to advise the government and develop a plan for the metropolitan hospitals services. One of their major recommendations was the formation of seven Health Care Networks based on the 35 independent public hospitals in Melbourne. This system commenced in August 1995 and continued under the Department of Human Services.\n\nIn 1996 the DHS had seven Health Care Networks: North Eastern; Western; Southern; Peninsula; Women's and Children's; Inner; Eastern. On the 19 December 1995, Dental Health Services Victoria was created as a Health Care Network. On the 1 July 1996 the Inner and the Eastern Health Care Networks were amalgamated. On the 3 November 1997 the North Eastern the Western Health Care Networks were amalgamated, and the Austin and Repatriation Medical Centre became a Health Care Network. The eight Health Care Networks resulting from these changes were: Austin and Repatriation Medical Centre; Dental Health Services Victoria; Inner and Eastern; North Western; Peninsula; Southern; Women's and Children's.\n\nIn 1997/1998 the DHS corporate divisions were restructured; Corporate Services and Change Management were incorporated into the new division of Corporate Resources. The two other divisions, Corporate Strategy and Portfolio Services remained the same.\n\nIn June 1999 DHS had the same three corporate divisions but changes in the functional divisions. The functional divisions comprised: Acute Health; Aged, Community and Mental Health; Public Health and Development; Disability Services; Youth and Family Services; Office of Housing; Aboriginal Affairs.\n\nIn 1999 a ministerial reshuffle resulted in the portfolios of Youth and Community Services being separated, with DHS reporting to the new Minister for Community Services. The Department of Education, Employment and Training reported to the new Minister for Youth Affairs. The ministerial changes were reported in Special Gazette No. S 155 20 October 1999. After the reshuffle DHS reported to the following ministers: Health; Housing; Aged Care; Community Services.\n\nIn November 1999 a Ministerial Review on Health Care Networks was established to advise the Minister of Health on new governance and management structures for metropolitan hospitals. The Review Panel's report presented in May 2000, recommended that the North Western Health Care Network, the Inner and Eastern Health Care Network had become too large. One of the Panel's recommendations was to extend the number of Health Care Networks from eight to twelve. This recommendation was not implemented by the Victorian Government.\n\nIn 2000, the responsibility for the Archaeological and Aboriginal Relics Preservation Act 1972 and the portfolio of Aboriginal Affairs, moved from the DHS to the Department of Natural Resources and the Environment (VA 3972). This change was published as part of Administrative Arrangements Order No. 165 in the Victorian Government Gazette No. G 24, 15 June 2000.\n\nAs of 30 June 2000, the new DHS had three corporate divisions: Policy Development and Planning; Portfolio Services; Resources. The six functional divisions were: Acute Health; Aged, Community and Mental Health; Community Care; Disability Services; Office of Housing; Public Health. Over the following year the corporate division of Policy Development and Planning was renamed Policy and Strategic Projects.\n\nUnder the Administrative Arrangement Order No. 174 dated 20 December 2001, a new Minister for Senior Victorians replaced the portfolio of Aged Care. The DHS reported to the new minister.\n\nIn the 2002/2003 the DHS underwent major organisational changes. The corporate divisions were combined under the new Financial and Corporate Services Division. The other divisions became: Policy and Strategic Projects Division; Metropolitan Health and Aged Care Services; Rural and Regional Health and Aged Care Services; Operations; Housing and Community Building (Office of Housing); Community Care; Disability Services.\n\nThe role of Advocate for Children in Care was appointed in March 2004. This function was an independent mechanism of review to assess the quality of services delivered by DHS and community service organisations, to children and young people in the out of home care system. The role reported directly to the departmental Secretary of DHS and was a separate unit to the other divisions (no Administrative Order). Following a major review of child protection laws both the Children, Youth and Families Act 2005 and the Safety Act 2005 provided new legislative framework and established a statutory body, the Child Safety Commissioner. In June 2005 the Advocate for Children in Care reported to the Office of the Child Safety Commissioner (DHS Annual Report 2004-2005).\n\nOn the 21 December 2004 a new portfolio was created and the Department of Human Services reported to the Minister for Children; the new Minister of the Crown was reported in Special Gazette S3 6 January 2005. The Department of Human Services then reported to the following ministers: Housing; Health; Aged Care; Children; Community Services.\n\nOn the 7 March 2005 the Office for Children replaced the Community Care Division. This Office included early years' services, juvenile justice and youth services, child protection and family services. (DHS Annual Report 2004-2005). The Office for Children worked to improve outcomes for all Victorian children from 0 to 18 years, through research, policy development and outcomes monitoring, coordinating the effort of all Victorian Departments and collaborating with local and national Governments. (Victorian Government Directory 2005 / 2006).\n\nThe DHS divisional structure at the end of the 2004 - 2005 financial year comprised eight divisions: Housing and Community Building; Office for Children; Disability Services; Financial and Corporate Services; Policy and Strategic Projects; Metropolitan Health and Aged Care Services; Rural and Regional Health and Aged Care Services; Operations. The Advocate for Children in Care was a separate entity which reported to the Child Safety Commissioner. The Commissioner reported directly to the Minister for Children and the Minister for Community Services. During that year DHS combined the two Northern and Western Health Care Networks to become the North West Metropolitan Region.\n\nIn the 2005 - 2006 financial year DHS set up a separate unit to the eight major divisions, the ICT Strategy and Governance which reported directly to the Secretary of the Department. The Policy and Strategic Projects Division changed name to the Portfolio Services and Strategic Projects and took on the function of cross-portfolio strategic priorities and policy direction.\n\nFollowing the re-election of the Bracks' Government, a Minister for Mental Health and drugs was appointed on the 1 December 2006 and reported in Special Gazette S315. On 5 March 2007 a Mental Health and Drugs Division commenced operation within DHS and comprised both the Mental Health Branch and the Drugs Policy and Services Branch. These changes were published as part of Administrative Arrangements Order No. 192 in the Victorian Government Gazette No. S 317, 5 December 2006.\n\nFollowing the 2006 election, DHS reported to the Minister for Health, Minister for Community Services, Minister for Mental Health, Minister for Children, Minister for Aged Care and the Minister for Housing. In the ministerial reshuffle after the appointment of John Brumby as Premier of Victoria in 2007, DHS reported to the new Minister of Senior Victorians. The new Minister of Senior Victorians and her colleagues in the Brumby Ministry were reported in the Victorian Government Gazette S184 on 3 August 2007.\n\nIn 2006 - 2007 DHS had nine major divisions: Disability Services; Financial and Corporate Services; Housing and Community Building; Mental Health and Drugs; Metropolitan Health and Aged Care Services; the Office of Children; Operations; Portfolio Services and Strategic Projects; Rural and Regional Health and Aged Care Services. The ICT Strategy and Governance continued as a separate unit.\n\nUnder Administrative Arrangements Order No. 196, Victorian Government Gazette S189 14 August 2007, the new Department of Education and Early Childhood Development incorporated part of the Office for Children. DHS kept the responsibilities for child protection and youth justice. The Office of Children within DHS was renamed the Children, Youth and Families Division.\n\nOn 12 August 2009 as a consequence of machinery of government changes, the DHS portfolios were divided to create two new departments: the Department of Human Services; also the Department of Health. The establishment of the new Department of Health was published on 12 August 2009 in the Special Gazette 277, Administrative Arrangements Order No. 202. The Department of Health incorporated the functions of health, mental health and drugs and aged care. The new DHS then comprised the following functions: disability; housing; children, youth and families.\n\nThe new DHS reported to the following ministers: Community Services; Senior Victorians; Housing; Health. Consequent to these cabinet changes DHS underwent a major administrative restructure. The nine divisions were restructured into seven which comprised: Children, Youth and Families; Disability Services; Housing and Community Building; Industry, Workforce and Strategy; Executive Services; Corporate Services; Service Delivery and Performance. The Executive Services Division supported three statutory bodies: the Child Safety Commissioner; the Disability Services Commissioner; and the Suitability Panel.\n\nOn 20 January 2010 there was a cabinet reshuffle after a minister's resignation. After the reshuffle, the portfolio of Senior Victorians was transferred to the Department of Planning and Community Development."

    "description": "Following significant machinery of government changes after the re-election of the Kennett Government in April 1996 the Department of Infrastructure (DoI) was established by amendment of Schedule 1 of the Public Sector Management Act 1992. Under Administrative Arrangements Order No.150 (Victorian Government Gazette S 33) the Department assumed responsibility for all functions of the Department of Planning and Development (VA 3094), except the Office of Housing, and the Department of Transport (VA 673) as well as the Office of Local Government from the Department of Treasury and Finance.\n\nThe primary functions carried out by the department following its establishment were: infrastructure investment planning, building, heritage conservation, local governance, major projects, strategic and statutory planning, ports, public transport, and roads and transport regulation (Victorian Government Directory, 1996/1997, p. 151). DoI reported to the Minister for Planning, Minister for Local Government, Minister for Roads and Ports and the Minister for Transport.\n\nIn March 2002, DoI assumed responsibility for functions associated with major projects and planning which were formerly the responsibility of the Department of State and Regional Development (VA 4189; Victorian Government Gazette S 41, S 54).\n\nFollowing the re-election of the Bracks Government, in November 2002, significant changes were made to the functions and responsibilities of DoI. First, DoI assumed responsibility for energy policy, formerly the responsibility of the Department of Natural Resources and Environment (VA 3972), under Administrative Arrangements Orders 182 and 183. This included the Energy Policy Division (which became known as the Energy and Security Division in 2003; Victorian Government Directory, 2003/2004, p. 225), the Office of Gas Safety (VA 4209) and the Office of the Chief Electrical Inspector (VA 4207). DoI also reported to the newly-created Minister for Energy Industries after the election.\n\nThe second significant change was DoI assuming responsibility for Multimedia Victoria and the establishment of a Broadband Access Office within DoI. To facilitate this, a Ministry for Information and Communication Technologies was established.\n\nFinally, some functions of DoI were transferred to different departments. The newly-established Department for Victorian Communities (VA 4562) assumed responsibility for the local government function of DoI, and planning and heritage functions were moved to the Department of Sustainability and Environment (VA 4554). The acts assigned to DSE included the Architects Act 1991, Heritage Act 1995, Planning and Environment Act 1987 and the Subdivision Act 1988 (Administrative Arrangements Order No. 183, Victorian Government Gazette S 252).\n\nThe major functions undertaken by the department following the 2002 state election were: infrastructure projects and services, public transport, management of roads, operation of ports and logistics, delivery of major projects, development of energy policy and information and communication technologies.\n\nIn 2005, under the Energy Safe Victoria Act 2005, the Offices of Gas Safety (VA 4209) and the Chief Electrical Inspector (VA 4207) were merged to form Energy Safe Victoria within DoI.\n\nFollowing the state election of November 2006, the Energy and Security Division of DoI was moved into the Department of Primary Industries (VA 4563) to form part of the newly created Energy and Minerals Resource Division within DPI, under Administrative Arrangements Order No. 192 (Victorian Government Gazette S 317, 2006).\n\nAnother significant change following the 2006 state election was the move of the Information and Communication Technologies portfolio into the Department of Innovation, Industry and Regional Development (VA 4564), including Multimedia Victoria.\n\nAfter the 2006 state election DoI reported to the Minister for Public Transport, the Minister for Roads and Ports and the Minister for Major Projects. The functions carried out by this department are major projects, public transport, roads, ports, and infrastructure administration.\n\nThe Department of Infrastructure became the Department of Transport (DOT) on 30 April 2008 to provide stronger focus on the delivery of transport improvements."

It was divided into 7 divisions which were responsible for the following functions:\n\nCatchment Management and Sustainable Agriculture\nResponsible for the development of policies and programs that ensured sustainable development, protection of Victoria's land and water resources and the control of pest plants and animals.\n\nForests Service\nResponsible for issues associated with the sale of Victoria's timber resources, including investigating new markets and establishment of state-wide price structures for all wood products.\n\nLand Victoria\nCollected, maintained and disseminated land-related information for Victoria and had a major role in the management of Crown Land, including registration, survey and valuation of land.\n\nParks, Flora and Fauna\nResponsible for National Parks in Victoria as well as for standards relating to flora and fauna.

A new department, the Department of Primary Industries, was established under Section 11 of the Public Service Management and Employment Act 1998. These changes were both published in the Victorian Government Gazette No. S231 on 5 December 2002. These changes effectively abolished DNRE and split its functions between the two new departments. The Department of Sustainability and Environment (VA 4554) assumed responsibility for functions relating to forestry, heritage, the environment, land and water management, planning, plants and animals and conservation. The Department of Primary Industries (VA 4563) assumed responsibility for primary production and resources."

The Banking Chamber was designed and built in 1891 to 1893.\n\nThe Bank acquired additional properties and in 1969 a decision was reached to redevelop the site. Godfrey and Spowers Pty Ltd., were appointed as consultants by the Bank and were instructed to prepare feasibility studies giving careful consideration to the possibility of retention of the Chamber. The consultants advised in 1970 that it was impracticable to retain the Chamber in the redevelopment.\n\nIn November, 1972 the Bank briefed their consultant team on requirements for a completely new building without incorporation of the existing Chamber.\n\nIn January, 1973 the National Trust of Australia (Victoria) announced the classification of the Chamber and moved to seek its preservation.\n\nA petition circulated by the Trust achieved considerable support from members and the general public. Formal objections against the proposal were received by the Melbourne City Council and a number of letters appeared in the press.\n\nThe matter was raised in the Parliament and both the Bank and the Trust discussed the situation with the Premier. It was agreed to appoint an independent Committee of Inquiry.\n\nThe formation of the Committee of Inquiry was announced in October 1973 by the Premier.\n\nWritten submissions were called for by advertisements in the press.\n\nThe Committee reported in favour of preservation of the Chamber."

The Panel was particularly concerned with the possible detrimental environmental effects the construction of a new power station would have, and examined a number of proposed alternate sites.\n\nIn its Final Report submitted to the Government on 27 April 1977, the Panel concluded that a 500 MW station, rather than the original 1000 MW proposal, should be built at Newport. The Panel also advised that the station be built and operate under strict Environment Protection Authority conditions to minimise its environmental impact. After the Panel's Final Report was submitted, it was wound up."

The Committee (MOC) was responsible for development of a successful bid by providing broad policy guidelines and strategic directions. The Committees functions were complimentary to the Governments objective of securing the 1996 Olympic Games for Melbourne.\n\nThe Melbourne Olympic Committee comprised 21 members with the following structure:\n\n4 members representing the State Government (inc. the Premier, Treasurer, Minister for Sport and Recreation and Minister responsible for Major Projects)\n4 members representing the Australian Olympic Federation\n2 representatives of the Melbourne City Council\n1 member representing the Trades Hall Council\n1 representative of the Federal Government\n8 members representing the Sector\n1 being the Chief Executive Officer\n\nTo enable the Committee to effectively carry out its responsibilities - given the limited frequency of meetings and relatively short time to plan the bid it was necessary to form an integrated committee structure and delegate certain responsibilities (with commensurate authority) to sub-committees, such as:\n\nExecutive Committee - its first priority was to manage the resources and business affairs\n\nBusiness Support Committee - to raise funds, provide contacts and assist with entertainment\n\nAn Australia Committee - to foster Australia wide community support for Melbournes bid\n\nStrategy Committee - to develop ideas and strategies for planning and marketing the bid\n\nEconomic and Finance Committee - to oversee the preparation of the financial plan for the Games, the financing options for the various facilities and the Economic Impact study\n\nand others\n\nIt appears that the Committee ceased operation in 1990."

    "description": "The Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody was established by the Commonwealth, the States and the Northern Territory in October 1987 in response to concern that the deaths in custody of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were too common and public explanation too evasive.\n\nThe Commission investigated the deaths of 99 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the custody of police, prison or juvenile detention institutions between January 1980 and May 1989.\n\nIn Victoria the Commission did not establish an office. In view of the relatively small number of cases (only six deaths notified to the Commission), it was not necessary to maintain an office. The Commissions investigations were facilitated through the Department of Premier and Cabinet, Police and Emergency Services, AttorneyGenerals, Office of Corrections and the Office of Aboriginal Affairs within the Department of Planning and Environment.\n\nThe Commissions activities were to look into:\n\ncircumstances of the deaths;\naction taken by authorities following the deaths;\nunderlying causes, including social, cultural and legal factors.\n\nAn Interim Report was presented in December 1988. It dealt with law and justice issues including custodial practices and post-death investigations.\n\nIn April 1991 the Commission submitted the Final Report featuring profile of the lives of the deceased Aboriginals.\n\nThe Royal Commission made a number of recommendations aimed at eliminating the disadvantages suffered by Aboriginal people. These recommendations included proposals in law and justice, youth education, employment, health, housing and infrastructure, land and other areas. The Government responded in taking appropriate measures including increased support for Aboriginal people, police training, etc..\n\nThe Victorian Government responded to the Royal Commission with immediate implementation of the Commissions recommendations, which mainly focussed on the justice system.\n\nThe Victorian Government has established an Interdepartmental Committee, chaired by Aboriginal Affairs Victoria, involving all agencies with responsibility for implementation of the Commissions recommendations.\n\nThe work of the Royal Commission took place over almost four years (1987-1991)."

The Credit (Administration) (Amendment) Act 1989 (No.4/1989) substantially amended Act 10091 to separate the credit jurisdiction from the SCT and required the establishment of the Credit Tribunal. Act 4/1989 came into operation on 29 April 1991 on which date separation of the credit jurisdiction from the SCT was complete and the Credit Tribunal came into being.\n\nAdministrative support for the Credit Tribunal was initially provided by the Adjudication Support Branch of the Ministry of Consumer Affairs.

Administrative support was then provided by the Courts and Tribunals Services of the Department of Justice.\n\nFunctions\n\nThe Credit Tribunal was empowered to hear matters arising under the Credit Act 1984 including:\n\nApplications by credit providers for reinstatement of credit charges (civil penalties) which had been lost for a variety of reasons, including inadequate disclosure of key information to consumers;\n\nVariations in contracts because of hardship;\n\nHearings in relation to unjust or unconscionable contracts;\n\nApplications by credit providers who sought to repossess secured items;\n\nGranting of compensation for failing to give notice before repossessing or failing to sell repossessed goods properly.\n\nRelevant sections of the Acts 10091 and 10097 came into operation on 28 February 1985. The tribunals dealt with disputes between consumers and providers of credit in cases with a statutory limit of $20,000. Disputes involving farm machinery and commercial vehicles, where no monetary limit applied, could also be heard by the tribunals.\n\nStructure\n\nPart V of Act 10091 (as amended by Act 4/1989) provided for the appointment by the Governor-in-Council of a Chairperson and Deputy Chairpersons to the Tribunal. The Chairperson and Deputy Chairpersons were to be barristers or solicitors of not less than seven years standing.

    "description": "The Victorian Council of Speech Therapy was registered as a trading company. Although the date of its registration is unknown as at September 1997, the Council is known to have been in existence by 1949 as this is the date of the earliest records extant. It was an association of professional speech therapists. One of the primary functions of the Council was the provision of clinical training for speech therapists. There is some evidence in the surviving annual reports that the Council provided training to speech therapists from all over Australia.\n\nThe Council was involved in the establishment of Lincoln House in 1966. Lincoln House incorporated the training schools of the professions of occupational therapy, physiotherapy and speech therapy and each of the schools was individually affiliated with the Victorian Institute of Colleges. Its successor, the Lincoln Institute of Health Sciences, was established in 1972 and the Victorian College of Speech Therapy ceased to be registered as a trading company on 24 April 1974.\n\nPrior to 1949 each state had its own speech therapy organisation. In 1949 the Australian Council of Speech Therapy was established as an umbrella body to provide some co-ordination between the states but each state retained its organisational autonomy.\n\nThe former Australian Council of Speech Therapy became the Australian Association of Speech and Hearing which was subsequently known as Speech Pathology Australia.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nFor records of this agency, see list below.\n\nThe records attributed to the Council were initially transferred to Lincoln\nInstitute and then to La Trobe University when it assumed responsibility for courses conducted at the Institute."

    "description": "From 1994 to 1995, Generation Victoria was the Victorian State body responsible for the generation of power to both Victorian and interstate customers. It's business activities included coal mining, thermal, gas and hydro electricity generation and support services.\n\nGeneration Victoria was formed as an independent entity following the restructuring and disaggregation of the State Electricity Commission of Victoria. Established under the powers of the Electricity Industry Act 1993 and the State Owned Enterprises Act 1992, Generation Victoria brought together the functions and responsibilities of the former SECV Design and Construction Group of Departments and the Production Strategic Business Unit, including the Brown Coal and Gas based Generation Business Units based in the Latrobe Valley, Newport Power Station and Hydro Operations, the Research and Development Business and the Loy Yang B Construction Project.\n\nFollowing the September 1992 Victorian State Government elections, the new State Government initiated a major program of review and reform of the Electricity Supply Industry in Victoria. Part of the reform process included the disaggregation of the State Electricity Commission of Victoria into three State Owned Enterprises.\n\nThe State Government announced it's intention to separate the SECV into three State Owned Generation, Transmission and Distribution businesses on 11 August 1993. The restructuring of the commission was legislated under the provisions of the Electricity Industry Act 1993, and on 5 October 1993, the Order for the establishment of Generation Victoria was made by the Governor in Council in the exercise of powers contained in Section 14 of the State Owned Enterprises Act 1992.\n\nFor accounting and reporting purposes, Generation Victoria was deemed to have operated from 1 July 1993. Generation Victoria was not officially formed as a new entity until 3 January 1994, when the SECV was disaggregated into separate Generation (Generation Victoria), Distribution (National Electricity) and Transmission (Electricity Services Victoria) businesses. The functions of Generation Victoria were previously the responsibility of SECV Production Strategic Business Unit (also known as the SECV Production Group).\n\n\nThe functions and powers of Generation Victoria were set out in Part 2, Division 1, Section 9 of the Electricity Industry Act 1993.\n\nThe functions of Generation Victoria were:\n- To undertake the Generation and Supply of Electricity\n;- To explore for, mine, produce and supply coal, gas and other raw products used in generation of electricity\n;- To acquire and trade in electricity, coal, gas and other raw products used in the generation of electricity\n;- To undertake the construction and operation of Power Stations\n;- To carry out research and development relating to the performance of the functions\n- To provide services, including management services, in the coal, gas and electricity operating industries.\n\n\nORGANISATION STRUCTURE\nBoard of Directors\n\nChief Executive Officer:\n- Loy Yang Project\n- Research and Development\n- Human Resources\n- Corporate Services\n- Industrial Relations\n- Finance\n- Public Affairs\n- Marketing\n- Strategy and External Relations\n- Energy Management Centre\n\nGeneral Manager Operations:\nTechnology and Services:\n- Services\n- Production Technology\n- Morwell Briquette and Power\n- Jeeralang Gas Turbine Station\n- Newport Power Station\nVictorian Hydro\nGas Power Stations:\n- Newport Power Station\n- Jeeralang Power Station\nYallourn W Power Station\nYallourn Mine\nHazelwood Power Station\nMorwell Mine\nLoy Yang A Power Station\nLoy Yang Mine\n\nDISESTABLISHMENT\nIn response to further Government Directives for reform of the Victorian Electricity Supply Industry, Generation Victoria was made responsible for overseeing the disaggregation of Victoria's Electricity Generating Industry into five independent Generating Businesses. On 31 January 1995, the following five new businesses were formed from within Generation Victoria:\n\nYallourn Energy Pty Ltd; Loy Yang Power Pty Ltd; Hazelwood Power Corporation Pty Ltd; Southern Hydro Pty Ltd; Generation Victoria Shell.\n\n Generation Victoria Shell maintained responsibility for:\n- Gas Generation Operations (Ecogen Energy)\n- Continuing employment of all Generation Victoria staff\n- Provision of Production Technology Services to the new Generation Businesses\n;- Industrial Relation co-ordination and transition issues arising as a result of the disaggregation process.\n- And for the Construction and Maintenance of Civil Engineer.\n\nIn March 1999, the Treasurer announced the sale of the assets of Generation Victoria to the United States based AES Corporation for $350 million through its subsidiary AES Transpower Holding Pty Ltd. The Minister's press release noted that this was \"the last sale in Victoria's electricity reform program\"."

It was also responsible for liabilities created by the SECV, including finance, land disposal and property, personnel, wrap-up of outstanding litigation, toxic tort, Loy Yang B Power Station, and SECV records. It was also responsible for the resolution of Electricity Industry disputes.\n\nIn May 1996, the Government moved responsibility for electricity, gas and the aluminium industry reform into an integrated Energy Products Division within the Department of Treasury and Finance. This was done to maximise competitive outcomes, and to manage the residual privitization of State-owned electricity assets.\n\nBy the year 2000, the Office of the Administrator was responsible for the administration of the residual rights of a number of other former State-owned enterprises in addition the SECV shell, namely the former Gas and Fuel Corporation, the former Port of Melbourne, the former Port of Geelong Authority and the former Port of Portland Authority.\n\nTrading Group (1994 ct)\n\nThe Trading Group, administered by the Traders Executive, was the division of the SECV Office of the Administrator responsible for trading in electricity for the wholesale market, i.e., Portland and Point Henry Smelters, Loy Yang B Power Station and other remaining liabilities of the SECV Office of the Administrator.

    "description": "Building of the Female Prison at Coburg began in 1889. The Female Prison, Pentridge was proclaimed in May 1894 under the Gaols Act 1890, as a separate establishment for female prisoners, operating within the walls of Pentridge Gaol (VA 863). It was Victorias first prison solely for females. Female prisoners held in the Melbourne Gaol were transferred to the new prison, and the Matron from Melbourne Gaol was appointed its first Governor.\n\nThis agency was known by several other names, such as Female Penitentiary, Female Prison Coburg, Female Division.\n\nIn 1909 a Reformatory Prison was established, which operated as a division within the Female Prison (or the Female Penitentiary, Coburg as it was then known). The Reformatory Prison (Female) was proclaimed under the Indeterminate Sentences Act 1907. The Reformatory Prison (Male) was established in September 1909. The Indeterminate Sentences Act 1907 established reformatory prisons. Prisoners deemed to be habitual criminals could be held at the Governors pleasure in Reformatory Prisons, until they demonstrated that they were eligible for release on probation. This legislation established the Indeterminate Sentences Board as a part of Inspector Generals Office.\n\nIn 1924, the Female Prison, Pentridge was reproclaimed and part of its area was taken to form the Metropolitan Gaol for male prisoners (following the closure of the Melbourne Gaol).\n\nFollowing the resignation of the Governor of the Female Prison in 1926, the position of Female Governor was abolished and the Female Prison was placed under the control of the Governor of the Metropolitan Gaol. Female prisoners were immediately under the charge of a Matron.\n\nIn 1932, the Female Prison was incorporated, along with the Metropolitan Prison and the Penal Establishment Pentridge, into His Majestys Gaol, Pentridge. The proclamation of HM Gaol Pentridge revoked the proclamation of the Female Prison of 1924.\n\nFrom 1933, female prisoners were held in the Female Division within HM Gaol Pentridge, under the charge of a Matron, and under the control of Pentridges Governor. (The Metropolitan Gaol became D Division, the receiving division for the whole of Pentridge. The Annual Report of the Inspector General for 1933 noted that, following the amalgamation, clerical work was now mainly carried out in the office at D Division, rather than separate record keeping systems being maintained by each prison.)\n\nThe Reformatory Prison for female prisoners continued as a division of Pentridge until 1957 when it was closed by proclamation. Reformatory prisons were abolished by the Penal Reform Act 1956 (no 5961).\n\nHowever, prior to the closure of the Reformatory Prison, its female prisoners and those housed in the Female Division of Pentridge had been transferred to Fairlea Female Prison (VA 926), which was officially opened by the Chief Secretary on 22nd June 1956."

    "description": "Background\n\nThe tribunal system was developed as an alternative to the more rigorous structure of the court system. It was an attempt to solve disputes in specialist areas where the courts previously applied general principles, in a much simpler and inexpensive way, often without the need for legal representation.\n\nDuring the 1980s the tribunal system expanded quickly. Although the Administrative Appeals Tribunal was established in 1984 to create a central structure for the hearing of administrative matters, tribunals were often established with separate administrations and procedures.\n\nThe process of reforming the tribunal systems began in 1995 with a paper entitled Tribunals in the Department of Justice: A principled approach. The research advocated the establishment of a new system of arrangement that would bring greater consistency in the way tribunals approached matters.\n\nFunction\n\nThe Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal was established under the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 1998 as part of a package of reforms to improve the operation of the justice system. A number of tribunals were amalgamated standardising procedures and diminishing the enormous overlap that existed.\n\nVCAT was created to offer a one-stop shop dealing with a range of disputes in its two divisions Civil and Administrative. The Civil division solves adversarial disputes in relation to consumer matters, credit, discrimination, domestic building works, guardianship and administration as well as residential and retail tenancies. It is made of the following lists that specialise in particular types of cases:\n\nAnti-Discrimination List\nCivil Claims List\nCredit List\nDomestic Building List\nGuardianship List\nResidential Tenancy List\nRetail Tenancy List\n\nThe Administrative division ideals with disputes between people and the government in relation to land valuation, licenses to carry on business, planning, state taxation and other government decisions such as freedom of information issues and Transport Accident Commission decisions. It consists of the following lists:\n\nGeneral List\nLand Valuation List\nOccupational and Business Regulation List\nPlanning List\nTaxation List\n\nBefore VCAT was established these matters were dealt with by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the Anti-Discrimination Tribunal, the Credit Tribunal, the Domestic Building Tribunal, the Guardianship and Administration Board, the Residential Tenancies Tribunal and the Small Claims Tribunal.\n\nThe members of the former tribunals were transferred to VCAT.\n\nStructure\n\nVCAT has a five tiered hierarchy of members. Part V of the Victorian Civil and Administrative Act 1998 provided for the appointment of a Supreme Court judge as President of the Tribunal (for a period of no more than five years). The President is to be assisted by two Vice-Presidents who are County Court judges. Deputy Presidents (as many as required for the proper functioning of the Tribunal) are appointed and manage one or more lists. There are also senior and ordinary members who work on a full time, part time or sessional basis. Members are allocated to Lists. However, members can be allocated matters from other Lists (provided that they have appropriate qualifications) to allow for the most efficient use of members time and expertise.\n\nDispute Resolution\n\nWhen a hearing is held, it takes place before a member of VCAT. Hearings are conducted in a relatively informal atmosphere and parties have the opportunity to call or give evidence, ask questions of witnesses and make submissions.\n\nParties can put their case directly to VCAT themselves or, in some circumstances, VCAT can allow the use of a lawyer or professional advocate to help settle the matter. In limited circumstances parties are automatically allowed to have a legal representative or professional advocate. At the end of a hearing, the Tribunal makes a decision. If any party remains unsatisfied with the Tribunals decision they can lodge an appeal, on a question of law, with the Supreme Court."

It opened on January 1 1845, the first large modern gaol to be built in the Port Phillip District. The Melbourne Gaol had a role in Victorias prison system as the Remand, Trial and Debtors prison. It also housed all female prisoners until 1894 when they were transferred to the new Female Prison at Pentridge (VA 4141).\n\nThe decision was made in 1922 to close the Melbourne Gaol and transfer prisoners to Pentridge.

The Committee had the power to coopt.\n\nThe Committee was appointed:\n\nTo make enquiries and to make recommendations as to the Regional Boundaries which might be adopted within the State of Victoria.\n\nThis was to be the prelude to an investigation and detailed survey of the States resources and for the planning and future development of those resources.\n\nThis work was carried on by the Central Planning Authority (VA 4151) and the Regional Committees comprised of elected municipal representatives and appointed Government representatives which were formed throughout the State."

The Melbourne Children's Court commenced operation in 1907, when cases where heard at the Melbourne Court of Petty Sessions. This system continued until the 1930's when the Children's Court moved into it's own premises.\n\nPrior to the establishment of Children's Courts in 1907 cases involving children were included within the records of the individual Court of Petty Sessions.\n\nFunction and Responsibilities\n\nThe Children's Court was initially established to hear and inquire into all charges against children and direct trial and appropriate action.\n\nThen in the 1930s a number of devleopments took place and the Melbourne Children's Court began to hear other cases involving children and young people under 17 years of age (such as cases regarding child neglect).\n\nUnder the Children and Young Persons Act 1989, Melbourne Children's Court operated as a division of the Magistrate's Court and was divided into two divisions, Criminal and Family\n\nThe Family Division heard and determined protection and irreconcilable differences applications.\n\nThe Criminal Division heard and determined all criminal charges (apart from murder, attempted murder, manslaughter, culpable driving and arson causing death. These cases must be heard in either the County or Supreme Courts.) against children between the ages of 10 and 16 when they commit the offence. The Criminal Division of the Children's Court also held committal proceedings for children charged with the serious offences listed above.\n\nDuring this time seven full time magistrates sat exclusively at the Melbourne's Children's Court.\n\nIn the 1980s cases were also regionalised within the Melbourne metropolitan area so that cases can be heard close to the child's place of residence. As well as the Melbourne Children's Court, other Children's Courts are located at Broadmeadows, Dandenong, Frankston, Preston, Ringwood, Sunshine and Werribee.\n\nIn 2000 Parliament passed the Children and Young Persons (Appointment of President) Act 2000, establishing the Children's Court of Victoria as an independent court with its head being a County Court Judge known as President of the Children's Court of Victoria. The Court continues to cater for children in both criminal and family jurisdications."

As it is assumed that the Ministry of Ethnic Affairs (VA 1042) had undertaken the \"policy development and administrative responsibilities\" of the Commission, the transfer of the substantive function effectively occurred from the Ministry of Ethnic Affairs to the Office of Ethnic Affairs within MEMCA. The Ethnic Affairs Unit within the Department of the Premier and Cabinet (VA 1039) superceded the Office of Ethnic Affairs following further machinery of government changes in October 1992. It has been subsequently known as the Multicultural Affairs Unit (from 1996) and the Victorian Office of Multicultural Affairs from 1999 2000.\n\nAs the Premier is also the Minister of Multicultural Affairs, this Office continues to be within the Department of Premier and Cabinet. The Office provides advice to the Victorian Government in the areas of immigration, settlement, community relations and multicultural affairs. Other roles are the assistance to other government agencies in the development of services, monitoring of policy, strategies and planning processes and the representation of the Victorian Government in inter-state and national forums."

These Terms of Reference required the Committee to inquire, consider and report to Parliament on the\n\noverlap and duplication of the roles and responsibilities between the Commonwealth and the State; and areas of responsibility for which the States should have an enhanced role for the benefit of the Federation, and in particular to:\n\n1. To inquire into and make recommendations about the specific nature and extent of problems associated with overlap and duplication of roles and responsibilities between the Commonwealth and the State including:\n\n(i) the desirability of developing general principles for assigning roles and responsibilities and what such principles might be\n\n;(ii) if different principles should apply to different functional areas, recommend which should apply to what areas; and\n\n(iii) identify reform opportunities for Commonwealth-State financial relations to give the States a secure revenue base; and to\n\n2. Identify areas of responsibility for which the States should have an enhanced role for the benefit of the Federation, with particular reference, but not necessarily limited to:\n\n (i) the role of the Senate\n\n(ii) examining the use and operation of federal decision-making institutions with a view to recommending improvements.\n\n3. Examine options for improved technological links between the Federal and State Governments and related organisations.\n(Government Gazette, 4 July 1996, pgs 1706/7)\n\nThe Committee subsequently tabled four reports.

As such it could comprise no more than nine members of whom no more than two could be appointed by the Council and no less than two by the Assembly.\n\nAs a joint investigatory committee, the Federal-State Relations Committee could inquire into matters referred to it by a resolution of either House or by order of the Governor-In-Council. It could also inquire into, consider or report to Parliament on any annual report or document relevant to its functions laid before either House. Recommendations made by the Federal-State Relations Committee (and any other joint investigatory committee other than the Public Bodies Review Committee) were not automatically accepted by Parliament. The responsible Minister, however, was required to table a report stating action to be taken regarding the recommendations within six months of the tabling of the report.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nRecords of the Federal-State Relations Committee are listed below.\n\n\\*\\*Special Access Conditions\\*\\*\n\nAlthough records transferred from Parliament are available for public inspection, special access conditions apply. Such records are transferred to the Public Record Office on the understanding that they remain the property of the Parliament of Victoria.

This Act resulted in Zoological Board of Victoria (VA 572) changing its name to 'Zoological Parks and Gardens'. The Minister for Conservation and Land Management was previously responsible.

The establishment of the Commission had been announced by the Premier (Mr Steve Bracks) in the Legislative Assembly on 8 December, 1999. The Premier stated at that time that the newly elected Government had made a commitment both during the election campaign and in its joint commitment to the arrangement between the Labour Party and the three Independent members of the Victorian Parliament. This commitment was to conduct \"an inquiry into the ambulance contracts affair surrounding the award of the Intergraph contracts and the subsequent failure to disclose documents concerning the matter, and also whether phantom phone calls were used to manipulate performance indicators\n\nFunctions\n\nAs part of the policy of privatisation of aspects of previously government - run activities and as a result of a review of the Metropolitan Ambulance Service in late 1992 and early 1993 there were immediate and far-reaching reforms. The MAS board was replaced by an administrator, new financial information systems and management information systems were instituted, a new computer aided dispatch system was implemented and other aspects of the operations of the sevice were out-sourced. In 1993, the Intergraph companies successfully tendered for the supply of the new dispatch system. In December 1994 this contract was varied for Intergraph to provide the call-taking and dispatch functions with the arrangement becoming operational on 29 August 1995.\n\nAnother issue of concern arose with respect to the outsourcing of the MAS Non-emergency Stretcher Transport services and possible conflicts of interest in the award of the contract. These matters provoked a number of significant Freedom of Information requests where neither release nor disclosure of documents occurring with some documents subsequently being 'leaked'.\n\nInvestigations into the management of contracts and their award were reported upon adversely by the Auditor-General. A subsequent report by Mr Ian Gaudion produced similar findings. An investigation was also conducted by the Victoria Police into related matters.\n\nThe original terms of reference of the Royal Commission reflected all of these concerns, with the Commissioner being directed to investigate the development and implementation of a computerised communications system, the consulting and outsourcing arrangements made for or on behalf of the Service, the legality and propriety of payments made to consultants particularly with regard to their documentation and the failure to make those documents public, whether staff members of Intergraph had made calls to the dispatch service to meet certain performance standards or to increase the entitlements of Intergraph and to investigate thoroughly those actions, whether there had been any illegal or improper failure to release or disclose documents under Freedom of Information with a number of specific cases being listed and whether there had been any illegal or improper conduct in dealing with a specified Ministerial Briefing Note.\n\nSix amendments were made to the Letters Patent of the Royal Commission with four of these altering its terms of Reference. The amendment of 16 May 2000 deleted Term of Reference 8 (to do with Freedom of Information requests relating to contracts and outsourcing practices) and expanded Term of Reference 5 to include 5(b) regarding illegal or improper conduct in enabling Intergraph to meet performance standards. A further amendment on 30 May 2000 deleted Term of Reference 3 (to do with the outsourcing of a number of other Metropolitan Ambulance Service functions) and amended Term of Reference 7 to reduce the number of Freedom of Information requests to be inquired into. Terms of reference 1, 2 and 4 (to do with outsourcing contracts and consultancy services) were deleted by new Letters patent of 3 October 2000. The same amendment expanded new Terms of Reference 5A which expanded the powers of the Royal Commissioner to investigate the '000' issue. On 21 June 2001 the scope of term of reference 7(b) was further clarified. Other amendments to Terms of Reference were to do with extensions of the reporting date for the Royal Commission.\n\nThe Royal Commissioner finally reported on Terms of Reference 5, 5A, 6, 7 and 7A.\n\nAbolition\n\nThe Royal Commission report was tabled in Parliament on November 27, 2001 in accord with the date set in the 24 July 2001 Letters Patent."

In light of this, the core functions of the V/Line Corporation was:\n\n- To focus on 'core freight' businesses (excluding public and private passenger services and the existing Fast Track portfolio),\n- To investigate opportunities to re-enter interstate markets for inter-capital container traffic,\n- To use the changes occurring in rail industry through the National Competition Policy as an opportunity to also expand and grow business in other interstate markets,\n- To transfer all Infrastructure Maintenance, Train Control and ancillary functions to the new Victorian Rail Track Corporation,\n- To outsource major Rolling Stock Maintenance, retaining only essential key staff and ownership of nominated facilities,\n- To structure overheads to meet business needs, and\n- To determine appropriate funding and capital cost structures.\n\nSection 16 of the Rail Corporations (Further Amendment) Act 1998 (98/1998) abolished V/Line Freight so that privatisation could proceed. The Public Transport Corporation, established under Part II of the Transport Act 1983, became the successor in law to V/Line Freight (subject to further research).\n\nThe Offices of the Premier and Minister for Transport announced on 22 February 1999 that Freight Victoria (a private consortium) was the successful bidder for the V/Line Freight Corporation. The consortium, which consisted of United States rail freight operator RailAmerica, Macquarie Bank, Goninan and Fluor Daniel, acquired a 15 year lease to operate and maintain Victoria's country rail network."

    "description": "Establishment\n\nLegislation allowing the appointment of Commissioners of Crown Land began with the 1833 NSW Executive Council Act 4 William IV No. 10 (see also 5 William IV No. 12). The functions of Goldfields Commissioners in Victoria in 1853 were established in 15 Vic., No 15. That act was amended by 17 Vic., No. 1, and 17 Vic., No 4, the latter being An Act for the better management of the Gold Fields in the Colony of Victoria. A Gold Fields Department existed in Melbourne by 1854, headed by a Chief Commissioner, and most likely under the ultimate control of the Colonial Secretary. The relationship with the Lands Department is not clear and requires further research. During the early goldrush period Lieutenant-Governors C. J. La Trobe and Sir Charles Hotham continued the practice of governors personally selecting lands and goldfields commissioners.\n\nFunction\n\nA Crown Lands Commissioner with gold mining responsibilities was first sent to Ballarat in 1851. Later, commissioners roles and responsibilities were better described in the 1853 legislation. By then, the position (now held by J. M. Clow) included issuing and detecting avoidance of licences and fees, settling mining disputes, and responsibility for order on the goldfield. At smaller goldfields, the Commissioner also acted as a magistrate.\n\nThe situation at Ballarat of political unrest mostly due to the gold licensing fee resulted in the Eureka Riots in November and December 1854, and led to various inquiries and reform of the management of goldfields. The Resident Commissioner during this turbulent period was Robert Rede.\n\nOnly four Commissioners were appointed at Ballarat between 1851-1855. They were F. C. Doveton, J. M. Clow, Robert Rede and Charles Sherrard. The original spelling of Ballarat was Ballaarat.\n\nAbolition\n\nRecommendations for reform of the management of the goldfields by a Legislative Council Select Committee, and by the Goldfields Commission of Inquiry and a Royal Commission led in 1855 to local wardens replacing the Gold Commission."

It is understood that the original constitution was dated 4 November 1874. The honorary secretary was John Williams (who was also the honorary secretary of Melbourne Hospital). The Lord Mayor of Melbourne, John McIlwraith, was invited to the inaugural meeting (by letter).\n\nThe committee met at the Melbourne Town Hall. The committee was formed to raise funds for hospitals and charities in and around Melbourne. Collections were made at churches, synagogues, etc., on a particular Sunday in September each year. The funds were later distributed to hospitals such as the Sick Children's, the Melbourne, the Women's, the Eye and Ear, and other institutions such as the Immigrants Home and the Benevolent Asylum.\n\nThe Hospital Sunday Committee in Melbourne was similar to philanthropic bodies in operation in some English cities in the nineteenth century.\n\nThe Hospital Sunday Committee also gathered money through Hospital Saturday appeals. These funds were collected by employers from their employees on pay day and forwarded to the committee.\n\nThe Hospital Sunday Committee was separate from The Lord Mayor's Fund Committee even though the Lord Mayor's Fund also supported worthy causes and was based at the Melbourne Town Hall. There was an administrative change in the 1990s when the finances of the Hospital Sunday Committee were managed by The Lord Mayor's Fund Committee (but the committees were still separate).\n\nIn (circa) 2002, the Hospital Sunday Committee began to operate as the Lord Mayor's Charities Fund October Appeal Committee. Money raised will be used to assist needy families.\n\nFurther research is required into the administrative history of this agency."

This Act repealed the Cinemedia Corporation Act 1997 and resulted in the administrative split of Cinemedia Corporation (VA 4119) into Film Victoria (Film Victoria II, VA 4379) and the Australian Centre for the Moving Image (ACMI). This Act came into effect on 1 January 2002.\n\nThe purposes of the Act were to:\n\n- establish Film Victoria\n\n- establish the Australian Centre for the Moving Image\n\n- repeal the Cinemedia Corporation Act 1997 and to abolish Cinemedia established under that Act.\n\nSection 46 of the Act stated that Film Victoria (Film Victoria II, VA 4379) and ACMI are the successors in law of Cinemedia Corporation (VA 4117).\n\nFunction\n\nThe functions of ACMI were:\n\n- to promote and exhibit the moving image\n\n- to develop, control, manage, operate and promote ACMI\n\n- to promote ACMI as a national centre for the creation and exhibition of the moving image\n\n- to establish, maintain, conserve, develop, promote and exhibit the collection of moving images\n\n- to promote public education and discussion with reference to the moving image\n\n- to develop and create exhibitions of the moving image\n\n- to develop and create materials for educational or other programs conducted by ACMI\n\n- to conduct research and development in relation to the moving image\n\n- to develop relationships to promote public education in relation to the moving image\n(Section 23 of the Film Act 2001).\n\nACMI was subject to the direction and control of the Minister for the Arts.\n\nAs at 2002, ACMI included the following divisions and business units:\n\nCreative Development\n- Curatorial\n- Web\n- Production\n\nProgram Development\n- Collections Managemnent\n- Public Programs\n- Marketing\n- Visitors Services\n\nOperations\n- Facilities\n- IT\n\nCorporate Services\n- Finance\n- Human Resources\n- Executive Services\n- Administration"

Arts Victoria was established as a division of the Department of the Premier and Cabinet (DPC) (VA 1039).\n\nFunctions\n\nArts Victoria had the dual function of being Government's arts funding body with a charter to increase the public awareness of and accessibility to the arts in Victoria and of having broad administrative responsibility for its various branches and agencies. Arts Victoria performed these functions by funding arts organisations through the State and through the services provided by the branches and agencies.\n\nArts Victoria was responsible for the implementation of the State Government's arts policy that sought to develop a vibrant and dynamic arts industry and position Victoria as the cultural capital of Australia. Arts Victoria was also responsible for overseeing the state-owned cultural agencies - Cinemedia, Geelong Performing Arts Centre, Museum of Victoria, National Gallery of Victoria, Public Record Office Victoria, State Library of Victoria and the Victorian Arts Centre Trust. In addition, Arts Victoria has coordinating responsibility for Victoria's Centenary of Federation cultural and civic program.\n\nAs part of administrative changes effected on 1 January 2015 by the incoming Andrews Labor government, Arts Victoria was renamed Creative Victoria and transferred from DPC to the new Department of Economic Development, Jobs, Transport and Resources (DEDJTAR) (VA 5034) along with all statutory bodies previously reporting to the Minister of the Arts except the Public Record Office Victoria (VA 683), which was retained by DPC in the portfolio of the Special Minister of State. Accompanying the change of name from Arts Victoria to Creative Victoria, the agency's mission was restated as being \"dedicated to supporting, championing and growing the arts and creative industries\"."

    "title": "Cabinet",
    "description": "Constitution of Cabinet\n\nThe Ministers of the Crown form the Government and receive their commission from the Governor. They are appointed from the Members of Parliament belonging to the political party or coalition of parties commanding a majority in the Legislative Assembly. They are considered to be collectively and individually responsible to Parliament and through Parliament to the electorate, for the conduct of their Departments and the agencies within their portfolios.\n\nUnder the provisions of the Constitution Act 1975 (No.8750) Section 50, the Governor may appoint up to seventeen Ministers of the Crown and members of the Executive Council, not more than five of whom at any one time may be members of the Legislative Council and not more than thirteen of whom may be members of the Legislative Assembly.\n\nBy convention a Government holds office only while it retains the majority support of the legislature and on losing that support the Premier is expected to either to hand in the resignations of his/her Ministry or to recommend a dissolution and general election.\n\nThe Premier is elected by a ballot of the Parliamentary members of his/her party. Although by convention it is the Chief Minister who nominates for appointment all other Ministers and who can recommend their dismissal, in practice in Victoria, the members of the Ministry are elected by the parliamentary members of the political party in government. The Liberal Party however reserves two positions for nominees of the Premier. The allocation of portfolios is the prerogative of the Premier.\n\nFunctions and Conventions of Cabinet\n\nIn Victoria all Ministers are members of Cabinet and by virtue of the authority accorded to it, Cabinet is the vehicle through which the actions of the Executive are determined. Cabinet considers policy and legislative proposals that are brought before it by sponsoring Ministers who are held to be responsible for these proposals. All Ministers now receive copies of all Cabinet documents including submissions, agenda and decisions.\n\nCollective Responsibility is a convention of Cabinet government and decisions are binding on all Ministers who are expected to first resign if they wish to criticize any of those decisions publicly. Decisions of Cabinet have no legal status and no force until they have been put into effect by individual Ministers providing the necessary administrative direction or until they have been endorsed by the Governor-in-Council or embodied in an Act of Parliament.\n\nThe strict confidentiality of Cabinet discussions is a second convention of Cabinet government. In Victoria, officials do not attend Cabinet meetings and the Parliamentary Secretary of the Cabinet acts as minute taker and prepares a draft record of Cabinet decisions which is approved and signed by the Premier. However officials from the Cabinet Office established in 1982 do attend meetings of Cabinet Committees and record the decisions of those Committees.\n\nMatters likely to be considered by Cabinet include:\n\n all major and/or politically sensitive or significant policy issues, including new policy items and variations to existing policies;\n matters which have a significant impact on the employment situation - both public and sector;\n proposals which cross the boundaries of ministerial responsibilities but cannot be handled outside of Cabinet - there may be a need for joint submissions;\n proposals requiring legislation - both new Bills and amendments to existing Acts;\n action regarding reports of Parliamentary Committees, or Cabinet Committees, including Cabinet Task Forces;\n matters likely to have a considerable impact on relations with Commonwealth, local and other State governments, the labour movement, employer groups, significant lobby groups, etc. and on community relations;\n expenditure and revenue proposals (normally considered in the Budget context); and\n senior appointments.\n\nRelationship With VA 2989 Cabinet Office\n\nA Cabinet Office within VA 1039 Department of Premier and Cabinet was established in 1982. The relationship between Cabinet and the Cabinet Office is subject to research. See the agency registration for VA 2989 for more information about the Cabinet Office.\n\nNote: Much of the information for the registration of the Cabinet has been taken from an article entitled \" The Cabinet process in Victoria\" by Michael Consolo in Freedom of Information Review, issue No.18 December 1988.\n\nLocation of Records\n\nThe only Cabinet records in the custody of the Public Record Office are those of the VA 4186 Cabinet Sub-Committee for Commonwealth Celebrations 1901-1902. See List of Holdings 2nd edition 1985, section 1.1.0.\n\nThere is some uncertainty as to the form and location of Cabinet records prior to 1982 when a Cabinet Office was established within the Department of the Premier and Cabinet. The Public Record Office has been advised that until 1982, there was no prior distribution of papers nor any official record kept of Cabinet meetings. However some records of previous Governments are in the custody of the Department of the Premier and Cabinet. These records were sealed at the change of Government and by convention, access would only be granted with the permission of the Leader of the Opposition.\n\nFor the period prior to 1982 records relating to matters considered by Cabinet may also be found among the records of Ministers and of the departments of state and statutory authorities for which they were responsible. The records of the Governor (VA 466) and the Executive Council (VA 2903) (see List of Holdings, sections 7.0.0. and 6.0.0.) may also include records relating to Cabinet matters.\n\nSee also the agency registrations for VA 3031 Parliamentary Secretary of Cabinet, VA 2989 Cabinet Office VA 1039 Department of Premier and Cabinet for information about series relating to all arising from Cabinet."

    "description": "The Department of Sustainability and Environment was established by the Bracks Labor Government in its second term and proclaimed in the Government Gazette, S 231, 5 December 2002. It was described as a name change under the Public Sector Management and Employment Act 1998, meaning the name Department of Natural Resources and Environment (DNRE; VA 3972) was changed to Department of Sustainability and Environment.\n\nAt its creation, the Department of Sustainability and Environment reported to the Minister for Environment, Minister for Water and the Minister for Planning. While the new DSE retained many functions of the former DNRE, some functions were moved. These included the function of primary production, which became the responsibility of the new Department of Primary Industries (VA 4563). Aboriginal Affairs passed to the Department for Victorian Communities (VA 4562), and Energy went to the Department of Infrastructure (VA 3971). DSE also gained responsibility for planning, formerly the responsibility of the Department of Infrastructure.\n\nThe primary functions undertaken by the Department of Sustainability and Environment were:\n- coasts and marine\n- conservation and environment\n- fire and other emergencies\n- forestry\n- heritage\n- land and water management\n- parks and reserves\n- planning\n- plants and animals\n- property, titles and maps\n- nature-based tourism and recreation\n\nPlease note that the tourism function related primarily to the development of tourism and recreation in national parks and other public lands, through Parks Victoria and related agencies. The primary function of tourism was carried out through Tourism Victoria (VA 4192).\n\nFollowing the re-election of the Bracks Government in December 2006, the Ministerial portfolios of Environment and Water were amalgamated and renamed the Minister for Water, Environment and Climate Change. The transfer of Acts was carried out as part of Administrative Arrangements Order No. 192, published in the Victorian Government Gazette No. S 317 on 5 December 2006.\n\nAs part of the machinery of government changes following the 2006 election, the Government also established an Office for Water within DSE. The function of this Office was to assess issues relating to water in Victoria, and to ensure that a sustainable water saving plan was followed. An Office of Climate Change was also established, within the Department of Premier and Cabinet (VA 1039), in order to coordinate a whole of Government response to climate change.\n\nFollowing the 2006 election, functions of the DSE remained unchanged. It reported to the Minister for Water, Environment and Climate Change and the Minister for Planning.\n\nOn 9 April 2013 DSE was renamed the Department of Environment and Primary Industry (DEPI) (VA 5002) by Order of the Governor-in-Council under section 10 (c) of the Public Administration Act 2004 (Victorian Government Gazette, S 124). The name change was part of machinery-of-government changes made by the Coalition Government under the new leadership of Premier the Hon Dr Denis Napthine MP in April 2013, and resulted in the transfer of existing DSE agencies and functions except Land Victoria (VA 862) to DEPI (VA 5002)."

    "description": "The Department for Victorian Communities was established in December 2002 by the renaming of the Department of Tourism, Sport and the Commonwealth Games (VA 4560) to the Department for Victorian Communities (DVC), under the Public Sector Management and Employment Act 1998 (Victorian Government Gazette S 231). Under Administrative Arrangements Orders Nos. 182 and 183, it was assigned acts from many different departments including the Department of Natural Resources and the Environment, Department of Education and Training and the Department of Premier and Cabinet (Victorian Government Gazette Nos. S 231, S252). Its primary purpose was to bring together key functions supporting communities so that planning and delivery of community-related services could be better co-ordinated and integrated.\n\nThe main divisions at its creation were:\n1. Community Building and Information Division, incorporating Community Programs; the Office of Community Building; Community Support Fund; Rural Women's Network; Information Victoria; Public Record Office Victoria; Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages.\n\n2. People and Community Advocacy Division, incorporating Aboriginal Affairs Victoria, Office of Women's Policy, Victorian Office of Multicultural affairs, Office for Youth and Employment Programs.\n\n3. Sport and Recreation Division.\n\n4. Office of Commonwealth Games Co-ordination Division.\n\n5. Local Government and Regional Services Division, incorporating Local Government, Sector Development and Governance and Legislation.\n\n6.

Another significant change was the assigning of the Adult, Community and Further Education Act 1991 to the Department for Victorian Communities, meaning that the Adult, Community and Further Education Board (VA 4280), a statutory body, was transferred into the Department. It became part of the Local Government, Employment and Adult Education Division.\n\nAs at 2007, the primary functions of DVC are: local government, sport and recreation, youth affairs, employment, aboriginal affairs, government information, women's affairs, multicultural affairs and adult and community education.

DIIRD was responsible for this strategy through its Office of Science and Technology. Following the November 2006 Victorian state election, ETIS became the responsibility of the Department of Primary Industries (VA 4563) as part of its Energy and Minerals Resource Division.\n\nFollowing the 2006 state election, DIIRD assumed responsibility for the Information and Communication Technologies functions previously part of the Department of Infrastructure (VA 3971) and Multimedia Victoria, under Administrative Arrangement Order No. 192 (Victorian Government Gazette S 317).\n\nAnother significant change was DIIRD assuming responsibility for the Office of Training and Tertiary Education, under Administrative Arrangement Order 192.

These administrative arrangements came into effect on the 30 April 2008 through Administrative Arrangements Order No. 199 of 2008. DIIRD then also reported to the new Minister for Major Projects.\n\nOn the 29 December 2008 a new Minister for Financial Services was appointed as announced in the Government Gazette S392. During 2007/2008 machinery of government changes also resulted in the transfer to DIIRD of Citizen Access and Transformation, and Workforce Participation.\n\nIn the both the 2008-09 and 2009-10 Annual Reports DIIRD had 11 organisational divisions comprising: Corporate Services and Development; Policy and Coordination; Skills Victoria; Innovation and Technology; Industry and Trade; Internal Coordination; Regional Development Victoria; Tourism, Aviation and Communications; Workforce Victoria; Investment and Major Projects; Economic Infrastructure. DIIRD also had one associated body, the Office of the Victorian Small Business Commissioner.\n\nThe Department of Innovation, Industry and Regional Development (DIIRD) was abolished on 2 December 2010 when it was renamed the Department of Business and Innovation (VA 4925) under the section 10 (c) of the Public Administration Act 2004, the Order in Council published in Victorian Government Gazette S485. The name change was part of machinery-of-government changes made by the newly elected Coalition Government in December 2010. Most functions of DIIRD were transferred to DBI, however some moved to other Departments. Skills Victoria transferred to the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development (VA 4840); part of Regional Development Victoria moved across to the Department of Planning and Community Development (VA 4838); and the public sector industrial relations function transferred to the Department of Treasury and Finance (VA 3745)."

    "title": "Nurses Board of Victoria",
    "description": "Establishment\n\nThe Nurses Board of Victoria was a self-funded statutory authority, established on 1 July 1994 with the proclamation of the Nurses Act 1993. The Board assumed the responsibilities of the Victorian Nursing Council (VA 1352). Its stated purpose was to protect the public by providing for the regulation of nursing through the registration of nurses, accreditation of courses for registration purposes or qualifications in addition to those required for registration purposes and to regulate the standards of practice of nursing.\n\nFormation and Membership of the Board\n\nThe Act provided for 12 board members, nominated by the Minister and appointed by the Governor in Council. This included nine registered nurses (including two nurses registered in Division 2 of the register), one lawyer and two persons who were not nurses.\n\nIn 2007 the Board structure changed with the passing of the Health Professions Registration Act 2005. The Act established a board with at least 9 and not more than 12 members, with half of the members to be registered nurses, 1 lawyer and 3 members who were not registered nurses.\n\nFunction and Operation\n\nThe function of the Board was to act as a statutory registration body for the nursing profession.\n\nThe Nurses Act 1993 defined the functions of the Board as follows:\n\n\\* To regulate the standards of practice of nursing\n\n\\* To register persons who complied with the requirements of the Act\n\n\\* To approve agencies or courses conducted by registered funded agencies\n\n\\* To set and conduct examinations, and accredit courses which provided qualifications for registration purposes and which provide qualifications in addition to those required for registration\n\n\\* To investigate the professional conduct or fitness to practise of persons registered under the Act and impose sanctions where necessary\n\n\\* To issue guidelines about appropriate standards of nursing practice\n\n\\* To identify and distinguish between the principal functions that may be carried out by nurses registered in each division of the register\n\n\\* To exchange information with registration boards in other jurisdictions about registered persons or persons who have sought to become registered in Victoria and provide information to the Australian Nursing Council about registered persons or persons who have sought to become registered in Victoria\n\nIn October 2002, the Victorian Department of Human Services commenced a review of the regulatory framework governing the registered health professions in Victoria. The review provided the opportunity not only to update all of the health practitioner registration Acts, but also to review the Victorian model of health practitioner regulation to ensure that the legislative framework satisfactorily equipped the registration boards to protect the public and address emerging challenges in the regulation of the health professions. The review resulted in the passage of the Health Professions Registration Act 2005, which came into operation on 1 July 2007. The key outcome was a single legislative framework that incorporated all of the relevant health professions and established a new registration board for each profession.\n\nAbolition\n\nThe Health Practitioner Regulation National Law (Victoria) Act 2009 (No. 79 of 2009) came into operation on 1 July 2010. The purpose of his Act was to provide for the adoption of a national law to establish a national registration and accreditation scheme for health practitioners. The Act prescribed the establishment of 14 new National Boards, 10 of which commenced on 1 July 2010. The National Boards may establish a State or Territory Board, where members are to be appointed by the responsible Minister for the participating jurisdiction.\n\nThe Health Professions Registration Act 2005 (No. 97/2005) was amended as a consequence of the enactment of the Health Practitioner Regulation Law (Victoria) Act 2009 (No. 79 of 2009). The piece of legislation that enabled these amendments was the Statute Law Amendment (National Health Practitioner Regulation) Act 2010 (No. 13 of 2010), proclaimed in the Government Gazette on 30 March 2010. The purposes of this Act included the abolition of the Nurses Board of Victoria and the removal of any references to this board."

    "title": "Hulk \"President\"",
    "description": "In the early 1850s there was an increase in the general population and a dramatic increase in prisoner population. To cope with this increase, as well as the stockades at Richmond, Williamstown and Collingwood, the hulk President was fitted out as a floating prison in 1852. The following year the hulks Deborah, Success and Sacramento were also converted to floating prisons. Occupied on 15 December 1852, the hulk President was intended for the coercion of prisoners of \"the longest sentence and most desparate character\".\n\nInspector General of Penal Establishments Samuel Barrow wrote the regulations for the hulk President which were accepted by the Colonial Secretary William Lonsdale and the Lieutenant Governor Joseph La Trobe. The regulations enabled prisoners to be kept in irons for their entire stay on board, in close confinement and in strict silence. No visits were allowed. No employment was permitted. Dark cells and half rations were prescribed for misconduct. Such was the effect of the President regime that Barrow urged the Colonial Surgeon to visit the hulk \"at least three times weekly because of these confinements and its effect on their [prisoner] health\". Barrow wanted neither mitigation of solitude nor employment for prisoners, despite the fact that the cells gave each prisoner only 32 square feet (2.97 square metres) of space. The cells of both the Eastern Penitentiary and Pentonville were three times larger.\n\nPrisoners on board the President had an influential ally in William Stawell, Attorney-General (1851-1857). Stawell wanted employment for prisoners on the President but he was fiercely opposed by Barrow. The Assistant Superintendent in Charge of the the President, Mr Horne, argued that if prisoners were permitted to work they would earn credit which would in effect shorten their sentence. Both Barrow and Horne sought government approval for visiting justices to be empowered to inflict whippings on prisoners. Stawell was defeated, Barrow victorious, and prisoners on the President remained idle. Visiting Justice Commander Crawford Pasco R.N. was also defeated by Barrow when he urged that at least books should be provided for President prisoners.\n\nThe harshness of the regime is obvious immediately from the statistics for 1853. On the President, with a prisoner capacity of eighty-four, there were fifty-two instances where solitary confinement had been imposed on prisoners already chained and isolated. These sentences were served in the punishment cells below water mark on the hulk."

Swinburne had been incorporated under s.24 of the Companies Act 1961 (Act No. 6839), and in 1973 a working party was established to determine the most appropriate form of incorporation. The working party's report, released in 1975 resolved to revoke the previous licence and set up two divisions of the company, VA 1192 Swinburne Institute of Technology and VA 4668 Swinburne College of TAFE. The licence was officially revoked on 4th April 1975, and the working party's resolutions were put into effect on 14th April 1975. From 1975, these two divisions were administered separately.\n\nArising from the martin Report 1965, the Federal Government introduced matching financial grants to colleges of Advanced Education. The Victoria Institute of Colleges (VA 571) was established and Swinburne Institute of Technology became an affiliated college.\n\nThis form of funding for tertiary education necessitated a separation of tertiary from non-tertiary courses. This separation was reflected in the structure of Swinburne College of Technology (VA 1217), prompting it to divide into a Higher Education and TAFE division\n\nAdministration was re-centralised for TAFE and Institute students in 1983, although they continued to be operated as two separate units. The TAFE plumbing course moved from Swinburne to Holmesglen College of TAFE in 1986 followed by the TAFE Building course in mid 1990. In 1991 Swinburne College of TAFE amalgamated with Prahran College of TAFE, which was known as Prahran College of Advanced Education until 1983. Swinburne College of TAFE formally joined Swinburne Institute of Technology (VA 1192) on the 1st of July 1992 to form Swinburne University of Technology (VA 4669). This was in line with the Swinburne University of Technology Act 1992 (Act No 44), which was proclaimed by the Victorian Parliament on 1st July 1992."

This Act officially amalgamated Prahran Collge of TAFE with Swinburne College of TAFE (VA 4668) and Swinburne Institute of Technology (VA 1192) on the 1st of July 1992 to form Swinburne University of Technology. In keeping with the division of the Swinburne Company Limited into two divisions, the Act acknowledged that Swinburne University of Technology would consist of two distinct operational divisions - the Higher Education Division and the TAFE Division. Mr Richard Pratt AO was installed as Swinburne's Foundation Chancellor on 15 March 1993.\n\nIn 1996 a new campus was opened at Lilydale and a new Division, known as Swinburne at Lilydale was added to Swinburne's structure. Swinburne at Lilydale offers Higher Education courses. The TAFE Division further expanded on 1 July 1998 following a merger with the Eastern Institute of TAFE, which operated campuses in Croydon, Lilydale, Wantirna and Healesville. This merger was the result of the Eastern Institute of Technical and Further Education (Merger) Order 1998, an order made under the Vocational Education and Training Act 1990 (Act No. 45/1990).\n\nSwinburne University of Technology became actively involved in the development of industry-focussed cooperative research centres both in Australia and overseas. Once such cooperative venture was the Laem Chabang School of Engineering in Thailand (established in 1998), and another was the Swinburne Sarawak Institute of Technology in Kushing, East Malaysia (established in 2000). Swinburne was a pioneer of Industry Based Learning (IBL), a program which placed students directly in industry for vocational employment as an integral part of the course structure. Swinburne University of Technology utilised its various divisions to promote flexibility of study for students. This enabled students to move between the TAFE sector and the Higher Education sector, or the TAFE based VCE program into full TAFE courses, or from degree courses into TAFE courses."

EMU would now manage the administrative and operational arrangements of the Sheriff's Office and PERIN (Penalty Enforcement by Registration of Infringement Notice) Court (Magistrates Courts). Under this revised structure the Sheriff reports to the Director of Enforcement Management. Previously the Sheriff reported independently to the Attorney General.\n\nBy late 1995 the Victorian Sheriff's Office had acquired responsibility for all court orders, fines, enforcement warrants and civil warrants in Victoria. It had become the first Sheriff's Office in Australia to be developed in this way.\n\nIn 1998 the appointment of Sheriff was amalgamated with that of the Director Enforcement Management which resulted in the merging of two roles.\n\nIn the lead up to the restructure the Sheriff's traditional duties in relation to juries became a separate branch of operations under the Deputy Sheriff Juries. The Juries Act 2000 superseded the title of 'Deputy Sheriff - Juries' with the new office of 'Juries Commissioner' finally making the role entirely distinct from the office of Sheriff in Victoria.\n\nFor further information about the Sheriff's Office researchers should refer to: A History of the Sheriff's Office in Victoria, by Kevin Morgan"

    "description": "The Great Ocean Road Trust was formed at a meeting at Colac on March 22 1918 to bring to fruition the scheme to construct an ocean road from Barwon Heads to Warrnambool as a memorial to those who had died in World War I. The road was to be constructed by the Country Roads Board employing discharged soldiers as defined in the Discharged Soldiers Settlement Act 1917. Initially, costs were to be covered by private subscriptions from supporters of the scheme along the coast and in nearby communities with approaches to be made to the Commonwealth and State Governments for matching subsidies. Post-construction maintenance would hopefully be carried out by the Government.\n\nBy 1920 it was apparent that costs would not be covered in the ways envisaged. It was proposed that members could loan money to the Trust. This money could then be used to purchase land from the Government which could then be subdivided and otherwise developed and re-sold at a profit. These profits would then be applied to the costs of the road construction. The Great Ocean Road (Land Sales) Act 1920 provided that land could be sold by the Government at the price of fifteen shillings per acre for these purposes.\n\nCertain members of the Trust formed a limited liability company - the Great Ocean Road Trust Company Pty Ltd - under the Companies Act 1915 in order to carry out these activities whilst the Trust itself supervised the construction and management of completed sections of the road. In 1922 the Great Ocean Road (Lands Exchange) Act (No 3250), in 1925 the Great Ocean Road Lands Act (No 3393) and the 1928 Great Ocean Road Lands Act (No 3623) supported and promoted the activities of the Company for the financing of the road construction being carried out under the auspices of the Trust itself.\n\nBy 1933 a loan was required for the completion of the Great Ocean Road. The Government was prepared to loan 25,000 pounds to be repaid over 25 years. The decision needed to be made regarding whether this was to be made to the Trust or to the Company. It was considered that it was the wiser course to have the loan made to the Company as that provided for corporate liability. As the Trust was a non-corporate body members were open to individual liability in any legal action or in relation to such a loan. Consequently, the Trust was dissolved with its assets and liabilities being assigned to the Company which was to carry on the work. Members of the Trust who wished to continue their association were invited to become shareholders in the Company by purchasing one share.\n\nIn 1936 the construction of the sand road had been completed. The Company was by then desirous of transferring and surrendering the road to the Crown to be proclaimed a public highway. For this purpose an Agreement, as set out in the Great Ocean Road Lands Act 1936 (No 4395), was reached that the Country Roads Board would become responsible for the road and the Trust Company's liabilities with respect to it. The Trust in turn was to transfer and surrender certain lands to the Government whilst still retaining some land which was required to be sold with the proceeds to be given to the Crown apart from the amounts necessary for meeting any outstanding obligations of the Trust and for the winding up of the Company. These were to originally be complete by 1 May 1939.\n\nThe Agreement did have a proviso that the Trust Company could not be wound up until all contracts entered into by it could be completed or discharged. At the end of 1939 the Chairman reported that some transfers of land had not been able to be completed and some outstanding amounts owed the Company had not been paid. This situation remained until 1955 when the Chairman finally reported to the Registrar of Titles that all transactions had been completed, the Company bank account closed and the documents of the Trust and Company and the surplus cash in hand handed to the Secretary for Lands who was responsible for winding up the Company. The Great Ocean Road Trust Company Pty Ltd ceased to exist on 22 February 1956."

This resulted in the recommendation by the Public Bodies Review Committee that the various water and sewerage authorities be abolished and a new structure set up. This re-structuring was legislated by the Water and Sewerage Authorities (Restructuring) Act 1983 (Act No. 9895). The objectives of this Act were the following:\n- to create interim administrative arrangements designed to facilitate the effective and efficient operation of the urban water industry in Victoria,\n- to make that industry more structurally coherent and to reduce its geographical and functional fragmentation,\n- to reduce the total number of bodies responsible for the supply of water and sewerage services,\n- to define the role of the Minister in the development of new structures and procedures in the urban water industry, and\n- to promote the more efficient, economic and effective allocation and utilization of the State's water resources.\n\nAs a result of this Act, new water and sewerage authorities referred to as Water Boards were created by Order-in-Council and the details of their constitution were published in the Government Gazette.\n\nUnder this Act, the Korumburra Water Board was constituted by an Order-in-Council dated the 19th of June 1984.

    "title": "Commissioner of Crown Lands, County of Bourke",
    "description": "In accordance with the provisions of An Act for protecting the Crown Lands of this Colony from Encroachment, Intrusion and Trespass 4 Will IV No.10 1833, \"Commissioners of Crown Lands in the Colony of New South Wales\" were to be appointed. They were to have the power of Bailiffs and were to prevent any unauthorised intrusion, encroachment or trespass on crown lands. They were authorised to make \"perambulations and surveys\" of crown lands and to require the assistance of Justices of the Peace when necessary. They were also authorised to erect landmarks or beacons in a manner approved by the Surveyor-General to denote crown lands and their boundaries.\n\nIn the following year, settlement in the Port Phillip District was authorised and Captain William Lonsdale was appointed Police Magistrate. An Act to restrain unauthorised occupation of Crown Lands 7 Will IV No.4 became operative in 1836. This Act provided for the issue of annual licences to depasture cattle and other animals on lands beyond the limits of location. Regulations governing the issue of these licences were published in the New South Wales Government Gazette of October 5 1836 and the Commissioners of Crown Lands were to be responsible for giving effect to the regulations. Renewal of depasturing licences was subject to the approval of the Commissioner of Crown Lands on whose report a licence could be cancelled. Surveyors Robert Russell and Frederick Robert D'Arcy were appointed Commissioners of Crown Lands in September 1836.\n\nThe Civil Establishment of 1839 for Port Phillip District cites a single Commissioner for Crown Lands - H F Gisborne. By 1840 there were Commissioners for Western Port and Portland Bay and by 1843 there were Commissioners of Crown Lands for Portland Bay, Western Port, Gippsland, Murray, the County of Bourke and the County of Grant. By 1846 a further Commissioner for the Wimmera District, proclaimed on 9 November 1846, had been added to the Civil Establishment.\n\nAdministration of Crown Lands\n\nThe Commissioners of Crown Lands reported to the Superintendent until 1851 and then to the Colonial Secretary until 1853 when F A Powlett was appointed as Chief Commissioner of Crown Lands and head of the Crown Lands Department (VA 2878). This Department was to be responsible for the sale, occupation and exploration of crown lands. With the establishment of responsible government in 1855, the Surveyor-General became the Minister responsible for the Commissioners of Crown Lands until March 1857 when the Commissioner of Crown Lands and Survey was appointed to the Ministry.\n\nIn 1857 the Board of Land and Works (VA 744) was established and the powers of the Commissioner of Crown Lands and Survey were vested in the Board. In 1858 a Commissioner of Crown Lands and Survey was reappointed to the Ministry, but statutory responsibility remained with the Board of Land and Works of which the Commissioner was President. From 1857 the Commissioners of Crown Lands were located within the Department of Crown Lands and Survey (VA 538), a sub-department of the Board of Land and Works.\n\nDuties of the Commissioners\n\nThe duties of Commissioners of Crown Lands included the prevention of unauthorised occupation of crown land; regulation of the boundaries of pastoral runs; prevention of encroachment and settlement of disputes; prohibition of cattle stealing and the impounding of stray beasts; collection of fees payable for government licences and collection of the stock assessment tax. The Commissioners dealt with applications for depasturing licences and provided each settler with a stock assessment notice. Commissioners also prepared returns for the Colonial Secretary regarding licensed runs and their occupants, the employment and conduct of the Border Police under their command and a monthly itinerary of their own activities. The Commissioners were also responsible for preventing clashes between the settlers and the Aborigines and as part of their duties as honorary protectors of Aborigines, they were required to visit reserves, report on the condition of the Aborigines and to supply them with food and clothing in cases of extreme emergency.\n\nIn 1853, the recently appointed Chief Commissioner of Crown Lands, F.A. Powlett, described the field duties of the Commissioners as being, \"estimating the grazing capabilities of runs, the value of land allotted under pre-emptive right, visiting the localities where new runs have been tendered for, preventing the unlawful occupation of Crown Lands, and the performance of other services..\". He described their official duties as being, \"the recommendation of all transfers of runs, the examination of claims to purchase land under the eighth clause of the Orders in Council. The preparation of reports and returns and general correspondence with the Government and the public.\n\nIn the unsettled parts of the colony and in Districts beyond the boundaries of location, the Commissioners of Crown Lands also acted as Stipendiary or Police Magistrates. In correspondence accompanying the Return of duties performed by the Commissioners of Crown Lands from 1 January to 20 October 1853, (Papers Presented to Parliament 1853/54, Vol.3), F.A. Powlett, reported that the discharge of their Magisterial duties occupied so much of the Commissioners' time that they were unable to properly perform their duties as Commissioners of Crown Lands.\n\nBorder Police\n\nIn 1839, an Act (2 Vic No.27) provided for the establishment of the Border Police. The Act authorized the levying of a tax on cattle and other animals depastured beyond the boundaries of location to defray in part the expense of maintaining the Border Police. Standing Orders for the Border Police published in the Victoria Government Gazette of 22 May 1839 placed the Border Police under the command of the Commissioners of Crown Lands who were to report monthly on the conduct of each individual. Instructions from the Colonial Secretary's Office to the Commissioners of Crown Lands dated 20 June 1846, required them to discharge the Border Police from 30 June 1846 since no further provision had been made for them within the Appropriation Act, although they were permitted to retain half a division if there had been a recent clash between the Aborigines and the settlers.\n\nA Confidential Circular to Commissioners of Crown Lands from the Colonial Secretary's Office dated 20 June 1846 warned them of an imminent loss of powers following the expiry of provisions of Act 2 Vic No.27. They were no longer to have the power to settle disputes between the occupiers of crown lands nor to call for returns of stock. They were further informed that while their powers to remove intruders were in doubt, it remained unlawful for anyone to occupy crown lands without a licence and the Commissioners were to continue to report any unauthorised occupation.\n\nReplacement of Commissioners with District Surveyors\n\nSome secondary sources such as the Victorian Year Book (e.g. 1968) have suggested that following a reorganisation of the Department in 1857, Commissioners of Crown Lands were replaced by District Surveyors. There is some support for this view in the report of the Civil Service Commission of 1859/60 which states that the Legislative Assembly had made no provision for the continuation of the Land Occupation Branch to which the Commissioners belonged. This report also affirms that District Surveyors had been appointed to act as Commissioners of Crown Lands. The Civil Establishment for 1858, however, continues to cite a Chief Commissioner of Crown Lands and Commissioners of Crown Lands for Wimmera and Portland Bay but there is no reference to the Commissioners for the other districts.\n\nThere is evidence to suggest that the duties of the Commissioners of Crown Lands were carried out by officers who held other positions in the Civil Service. William Piper, who was the Commissioner of Crown Lands for the Murray District (VA 2711) continued to carry out duties associated with this position at least until 1860, although from 1858 he is listed in the Civil Establishment as the Police Magistrate, Benalla (see VPRS 7294). Appointments of Commissioners of Crown Land are found in the Government Gazettes for this period, but the appointees usually hold another substantial position eg. as Police Magistrate or Resident Warden and the Commissioner of Crown Lands positions are not designated by district. Further research is required to determine the final year in which Commissioners of Crown Lands were appointed."

At the same time a Clerk of the bench and Constables were also appointed with a Commissioner of Crown Lands and the Portland Bay Survey Office also as part of the Government establishment.\n\nBy c1850 a Coroner's Court and a Court of Petty Sessions had been established in Portland thus making the Police Magistrate the principal officer of the courts rather than him having any broader administrative role. From about 1859 it would appear that the Police magistrate was stationed at Belfast (Port Fairy) or Warrnambool rather than at Portland."

In 1858 a Commissioner of Crown Lands and Survey was reappointed to the Ministry, but statutory responsibility remained with the Board of Land and Works of which the Commissioner was President. From 1857 the Commissioners of Crown Lands were located within the Department of Crown Lands and Survey (VA 538), a sub-department of the Board of Land and Works.\n\nDuties of the Commissioners\n\nThe duties of Commissioners of Crown Lands included the prevention of unauthorised occupation of crown land; regulation of the boundaries of pastoral runs; prevention of encroachment and settlement of disputes; prohibition of cattle stealing and the impounding of stray beasts; collection of fees payable for government licences and collection of the stock assessment tax. The Commissioners dealt with applications for depasturing licences and provided each settler with a stock assessment notice. Commissioners also prepared returns for the Colonial Secretary regarding licensed runs and their occupants, the employment and conduct of the Border Police under their command and a monthly itinerary of their own activities. The Commissioners were also responsible for preventing clashes between the settlers and the Aborigines and as part of their duties as honorary protectors of Aborigines, they were required to visit reserves, report on the condition of the Aborigines and to supply them with food and clothing in cases of extreme emergency.\n\nIn 1853, the recently appointed Chief Commissioner of Crown Lands, F.A. Powlett, described the field duties of the Commissioners as being, \"estimating the grazing capabilities of runs, the value of land allotted under pre-emptive right, visiting the localities where new runs have been tendered for, preventing the unlawful occupation of Crown Lands, and the performance of other services\". He described their official duties as being, \"the recommendation of all transfers of runs, the examination of claims to purchase land under the eighth clause of the Orders in Council. The preparation of reports and returns and general correspondence with the Government and the public.\n\nIn the unsettled parts of the colony and in Districts beyond the boundaries of location, the Commissioners of Crown Lands also acted as Stipendiary or Police Magistrates. In correspondence accompanying the Return of duties performed by the Commissioners of Crown Lands from 1 January to 20 October 1853, (Papers Presented to Parliament 1853/54, Vol.3), F.A. Powlett, reported that the discharge of their Magisterial duties occupied so much of the Commissioners' time that they were unable to properly perform their duties as Commissioners of Crown Lands.\n\nBorder Police\n\nIn 1839, an Act (2 Vic No.27) provided for the establishment of the Border Police. The Act authorized the levying of a tax on cattle and other animals depastured beyond the boundaries of location to defray in part the expense of maintaining the Border Police. Standing Orders for the Border Police published in the Victoria Government Gazette of 22 May 1839 placed the Border Police under the command of the Commissioners of Crown Lands who were to report monthly on the conduct of each individual. Instructions from the Colonial Secretary's Office to the Commissioners of Crown Lands dated 20 June 1846, required them to discharge the Border Police from 30 June 1846 since no further provision had been made for them within the Appropriation Act, although they were permitted to retain half a division if there had been a recent clash between the Aborigines and the settlers.\n\nA Confidential Circular to Commissioners of Crown Lands from the Colonial Secretary's Office dated 20 June 1846 warned them of an imminent loss of powers following the expiry of provisions of Act 2 Vic No.27. They were no longer to have the power to settle disputes between the occupiers of crown lands nor to call for returns of stock. They were further informed that while their powers to remove intruders were in doubt, it remained unlawful for anyone to occupy crown lands without a licence and the Commissioners were to continue to report any unauthorised occupation.\n\nReplacement of Commissioners with District Surveyors\n\nSome secondary sources such as the Victorian Year Book (e.g. 1968) have suggested that following a reorganisation of the Department in 1857, Commissioners of Crown Lands were replaced by District Surveyors. There is some support for this view in the report of the Civil Service Commission of 1859/60 which states that the Legislative Assembly had made no provision for the continuation of the Land Occupation Branch to which the Commissioners belonged. This report also affirms that District Surveyors had been appointed to act as Commissioners of Crown Lands. The Civil Establishment for 1858, however, continues to cite a Chief Commissioner of Crown Lands and Commissioners of Crown Lands for Wimmera and Portland Bay but there is no reference to the Commissioners for the other districts.\n\nThere is evidence to suggest that the duties of the Commissioners of Crown Lands were carried out by officers who held other positions in the Civil Service. William Piper, who was the Commissioner of Crown Lands for the Murray District (VA 2711) continued to carry out duties associated with this position at least until 1860, although from 1858 he is listed in the Civil Establishment as the Police Magistrate, Benalla (see VPRS 7294). Appointments of Commissioners of Crown Land are found in the Government Gazettes for this period, but the appointees usually hold another substantial position eg. as Police Magistrate or Resident Warden and the Commissioner of Crown Lands positions are not designated by district. Further research is required to determine the final year in which Commissioners of Crown Lands were appointed."

Prince Henry's Hospital Medical Research Centre was established in 1960. Its first annual report was published 30 June 1961.\n\nFrom 1962, the focus of the Medical Research Centre was endocrine research.

From 1849, the emphasis of patrols began to shift toward patrolling the new gold finds in Port Phillip. During 1850 and 1851 the Native Police also acted as guards at Pentridge.\n\nThe Corps also carried messages to colonial outposts, undertook searches for lost settlers and provided escorts for travellers (including both prisoners and dignitaries and senior office-holders when ranging into unfamiliar territory).\n\nIn 1851, shortly before the Corps was disbanded, the number of Aboriginal troopers was 45, while European members numbered 15 out of the total of 60.\n\nThe Corps was disbanded in early 1853, after a period where its numbers had been reduced by factors including:\n\n- the death of Sir Henry Dana, after which many Aboriginal troopers left the Corps\n- the increased prevalence of tasks such as acting as prison guards\n- the expanded employment opportunities offered by the gold rush"

    "description": "The Melbourne Old Cemetery was in existence as a burial ground apparently from 1837. The burial ground was made up of several parcels of Crown Lands each of which was granted by the Crown for the use of certain named Religious Denominations. The cemetery was divided into sections for each religious denomination.\n\nIn June, 1854, the old Cemetery was closed as a burial place. However, the rights of certain parties who possessed land prior to 1850 were reserved. The cemetery was not then placed under trustees, but under a committee, the members of which were chosen from the different denominations.\n\nIn 1864 it was re opened and placed under trustees. (Refer to the Cemeteries Statute 1864, (27 Vic. No. 201), appointment of trustees gazetted on 26 April 1864).\n\nEach trustee represented one of the religious bodies to whom Crown grants were made. The trustees included the Bishop of Melbourne who was merely the owner of the parcel of land held in Trust and for the interment of deceased persons of the Church of England Community. The Chairman of the Trust was responsible for the discharge of statutory duties.\n\nThe Cemeteries Act 1880 (44 Vic. No. 677) provided for grants of money for the Management of Cemeteries.\n\nPrior to 1890, responsibility for cemeteries was split between Lands (VRG 18), Chief Secretary (VRG 26) and Public Works (VRG 28). Thereafter, responsibility passed to the Minister for Health, (VRG 39). Cemeteries were controlled by a Trust. Trustees were approved by the Governor in Council on the recommendation by the responsible Minister. The Trust was responsible for the maintenance of the cemetery and the erection of monuments, handling of funds and submitted to the Commission of Public Health an Abstract of Accounts of all money received and expended.\n\nThe gradual encroachment of what is now known as the Queen Victoria Market saw portions of the Old Cemetery (the Old Melbourne Burial Ground) land being taken over by the market. In 1877 the sections allocated to Aboriginals and Quakers and the unused parts of the Jewish section were taken over by the Corporation of Melbourne City for the purpose of the General Market. The parcel of land granted to Bishop of Melbourne and his successors in trust for the United Church of England and Ireland in Victoria remained untouched.\n\nIn 1917, the Melbourne General Markets Land Act (No. 2913) allowed the Melbourne City Council to reclaim cemetery land for the use of the market. The Council had the responsibility of overseeing the operations of the cemetery through the appointment of trustees. The Melbourne City Council was a co-trustee of the cemetery with the Board of Land and Works (VA 669).\n\nThe final burial in the old Melbourne cemetery took place in 1917. It was closed permanently in 1922.\n\nExhumation of bodies began in 1920. Only marked graves were exhumed. George Simms of the Melbourne City Council had the responsibility for the exhumations and he identified 525 marked graves. Human remains were found in the early 1990's during excavation work for the market car park, the site of the major part of the Old Cemetery grounds. As part of the exhumation process 70 significant memorials were identified and relocated to the Fawkner Park old Pioneers Section. Other bodies were reinterred at cemeteries around Melbourne.\n\nFor burial records, see inventories of series for VA 511 Melbourne City Council."

Some complaints were resolved through conciliation while others required investigation by OPI. The OPI is required by law to refer some complaints to the Ethical Standards Department of Victoria Police to handle."

The goals of the legislation were to establish a framework for the sale of liquor that contributed to the minimisation of harm whilst facilitating the development of the industry and meeting community expectations regarding the availability and appropriate opportunities for the consumption of liquor.\n\nThe Commission was replaced by a Director of Liquor Licensing to be appointed by the Governor in Council. The Director was to be responsible for the administration of the Act with the power to determine applications for licences and permits in a timely and accurate fashion. Liquor licensing (as Liquor Licensing Victoria) operates as part of the small business portfolio situated in the Department of State Development and later the Department of State and Regional Development. In 2002, it became part of the consumer affairs portfolio within the Department of Justice VA 3085. The agency became a statutory body in 2006.\n\nA Liquor Licensing Panel, with the number of members to be determined by the Minister was established to consider the merits of objections against licence applications referred to it by the Director and to provide a recommendation to the Director as to whether the application should be granted. Further rights of appeal to the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal were provided for in the Act.\n\nThe option for areas to remain dry after a poll conducted by local municipalities remained as did the system of licensing inspectors. Inspectors were to be appointed by the Chief Commissioner of Police from members of the police force of the rank of inspector or above. Police retained the right to issue infringement notices for breaches of the Act and to take proceedings in a Magistrates Court and/or before the Victorian Civil and Administrative tribunal.\n\nThe Act also established the Co-ordinating Council on Control of Liquor Abuse. The fifteen members of the Council were to be made up of persons representing the Minister responsible for the administration of specific Acts and persons with expertise and knowledge in specified areas, all to be nominated by the Minister and appointed by the Governor in Council. The Councils function is to advise the Minister on the problems of alcohol abuse and other matters as referred by the Minister."

However, in 1943 the council decided to transfer the functions and responsibilities of the Baby Health Centre Committee to the (Council's) Health and Public Works Committee from 1 June 1943.

    "description": "On the 14 August 2007 the Labor Government established the Department of Planning and Community Development (DPCD) under Section 10 of the Public Administration Act 2004 (Victorian Government Gazette, S 189). This change followed a cabinet reshuffle after the resignation of then Premier Bracks and the appointment of John Brumby as Premier (Victorian Government Gazette, S 181 and 184). The changes were announced on 2 August by Premier Brumby.\n\nThe DPCD was formed by combining the Office of Planning and Urban Design with the core community development functions of the former Department for Victorian Communities. Heritage Victoria was transferred from the Department of Sustainibility and the Environment to be incorporated into the DPCD's Planning and Local Government group.\n\nAt the time of establishment the DPCD reported to the following ministers: Planning; Community Development; Multicultural Affairs; Veterans' Affairs; Skills and Workplace Participation (Adult, Community and Further Education); Sport Recreation and Youth Affairs; Women's Affairs; Community Services (Office for Disability); Senior Victorians; Local Government; Aboriginal Affairs.\n\nThe five organisational groups within the new Department comprised: Planning and Local Government; Community Development including Sport and Recreation Victoria; Strategic Policy, Research and Forecasting; People and Community Advocacy; Corporate, Organisational Development and Communications. The Ministerial Taskforce on Aboriginal Affairs was a separate entity to the divisions and directly reported to the Secretary of the Department.\n\nIn 2008 the function Sport and Recreation Victoria became a separate division from Community Development. The other five groups within the Department did not change.\n\nIn September 2008 the Secretary of DPCD's function of providing financial accounts and reports under the Planning Provisions of the Planning and Environment Act 1987 (Clause 66.02-3 and Clause .02-7) was transferred to the Secretary of the Department of Sustainability and Environment through Administrative Arrangements Order No. 200 dated 14 October 2008.\n\nIn September 2009 a new Local Government Investigations and Compliance Inspectorate (LGICI) was established, with the administrative arrangements coming into effect on the 1 September 2009 through Administrative Arrangements Order No. 202 of 2009. This administrative office was a separate entity to the rest of the department with the Chief Municipal Inspector directly reporting directly to the Secretary of DPCD. The Ministerial Taskforce on Aboriginal Affairs was the other continuing entity which reported directly to the Secretary of DPCD.\n\nOn the 18 December 2009 under the Public Administration Act 2004 an Establishment of Administrative Office Order in Council notice in the Victorian Government Gazette G 51 records that the Victorian Multicultural Commission was moved to the Department of Premier and Cabinet (DPC). This transfer of function from DPCD to DPC coincided with portfolio of Multicultural Affairs moving to DPC. In this instance there are no Administrative Orders or Minister of the Crown Changes (the ministerial portfolio did not change) in the Victorian Government Gazettes.\n\nOn the 20 January 2010 there was a cabinet reshuffle after a minister's resignation. Consequent to the MOG changes the new portfolio of The Respect Agenda was created (Special Gazette S25 2010). The Respect Secretariat was established within the DPCD's division of Strategic Policy, Research and Forecasting.\n\nIn 2010 the DPCD then reported to the following ministers: Planning; The Respect Agenda; Community Development; Local Government; Aboriginal Affairs; Sport, Recreation and Youth Affairs; Skills and Workforce Participation (Adult, Community and Further Education); Women's Affairs; Community Services (Disability); Senior Victorians; Veterans' Affairs.\n\nIn 2010 DPCD was divided into six primary organisational groups: Planning and Local Government; Community Development; Sport and Recreation Victoria; People and Community Advocacy; Strategic Policy, Research and Forecasting; Corporate, Organisational Development and Communications.\n\nIn December 2010 under the new Baillieu ministry, DPCD took on the following functions: Regional Development Victoria moved from the Department of Innovation, Industry and Regional Development; integrated transport and land-use planning from Department of Transport. As a result of DPCD receiving the function Regional Development Victoria, the regional teams from the Community Development group were amalgamated. A new Peri-Urban council unit was established within DPCD to help Councils with long-term strategic and structure planning, also a housing affordability unit.\n\nWith the MOG changes several functions were transferred from DPCD to other departments. The Office for Youth, the Office for Women's Policy and the Office for Disability all moved to the Department of Human Services (DHS). The core functions and resources from DPCD's Community Development group relating to disadvantage and the Neighbourhood Program (comprising Community Renewal, Micro Finance Hubs, Men's Sheds, Men's Building Bridges bushfire recovery program, Neighbourhood Houses), also moved to DHS.\n\nOther MOG changes comprised: Office of Senior Victorians within the People and Community Advocacy group transfers to the Department of Health. The Adult Community and Further Education unit was transferred to the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development. The administration of the Community Support Fund from the Community Development group was transferred to the Department of Treasury and Finance, although the investment functions remained with DPCD including the administration of the Victorian Community Support program (VCSG).\n\nUnder the new Baillieu ministry DPCD reported to the following ministers: Regional and Rural Development; Aboriginal Affairs; Local Government; Planning; Regional Cities; Sport and Recreation; Veteran's Affairs.\n\nAfter the MOG changes in 2011 the DPCD comprised six organisational groups: Planning and Local Government; Sport and Recreation, Veteran's Affairs; Regional Development Victoria; Community Development and Regional Delivery; Corporate Services; Strategic Policy and Research.\n\nNote: The Youth Affairs function after 2006 does not correlate with a related Victorian Record Group (VRG). The VRG 150 Employment and Youth Affairs spans the years 2002 to 2006. There is no Victorian Function (VF) for Veteran's Affairs which is a current function of DPCD in 2011.\n\nOn 9 April 2013 DPCD was abolished, its functions (with exceptions) transferring to the new Department of Transport, Planning and Local Infrastructure (DTPLI) (VA 5003) by order of the Governor-in-Council under section 10 (c) of the Public Administration Act 2004 (Victorian Government Gazette, S 124). This was part of machinery-ofgovernment changes made by the Coalition Government under the new leadership of Premier the Hon Dr Denis Napthine MP.\n\nSubordinate agencies and functions not transferred to DTPLI were Regional Development Victoria (VA 4790) along with the regionally-focussed elements of Community Development, which moved to the Department of State Development and Business Innovation (DSDPI) (VA 5001); Aboriginal Affairs Victoria (VA 3101) and the Veterans' Unit, which went to the Department of Premier and Cabinet (DPC) (VA 1039); and the Office for the Community Sector, which moved to the Department of Human Services (DHS) (VA 3970)."

PTSV reported to the Minister for Public Transport only.\n\nOn the 14 October 2008 under section 17 of the State Owned Enterprises Act 1992, Order in Council, V/Line Passenger Corporation, a statutory corporation, became a State business corporation.\n\nIn the 2008/2009 financial year the Regional Rail Link division was established in response to $3.2 billion Commonwealth Government funding for a $4.3 billion train link from West Werribee to Deer Park and then Southern Cross Station for regional train services from Ballarat, Bendigo and Geelong.\n\nIn January 2009 the Delivery Coordination Unit was established. This unit reported to the Deputy Secretary and seems to have taken over the function of the former Project Management Office. In the Annual Report organisational structure dated 30 June 2009 the Audit and Assurance function is a separate office that directly reported to the Secretary of the Department.\n\nOn 12 May 2009, part 5 of the Transport Legislation Miscellaneous Amendments Act 2009 extended the scope of the Southern and Eastern Integrated Transport Authority (SEITA). By 2009 SEITA was trading as Linking Melbourne Authority (LMA) reflecting this change. LMA was established formally on 1 July 2010 under section 134 of the Transport Integration Act 2010 and was the successor to SEITA.\n\nOn 28 July 2009 part 3 of the Transport Legislation General Amendments Act 2009 abolished the SCSA. The administration of the Southern Cross Station and its related infrastructure became part of the Public Transport division of DOT.\n\nOn 17 December 2009 the Transport Legislation Amendment Act (Hoon Boating and Other Amendments) amended the EastLink Act 2004 transferring responsibility for managing the EastLink Project from LMA to VicRoads.\n\nThe Transport Integration Act 2010, proclaimed on 2 March in Victorian Government Gazette S76, brought together the transport portfolio, including ports and marine, under one statute for the first time in the State's history. It replaced the Transport Act 1983, renamed the Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983, as Victoria's primary transport statute. The Act facilitated the implementation of the report The Victorian Transport Plan published in April 2009.\n\nThe new Act which came into effect on 1 July 2010 required all Victorian transport agencies, including the Director of Public Transport, VicRoads, VicTrack, V/Line and LMA to work together towards an integrated and sustainable transport system.\n\nIn the DOT Annual Report for 2009-2010, the organisational structure as of 30 June 2010 had the following 12 divisions. The following divisions reported to the Deputy Secretary of Strategic Transport Planning: Marine Safety Victoria; Freight Logistics and Marine; Integrated Transport Planning Division; Intergovernmental Relations; Policy and Communications. The other divisions reported to the Deputy Secretary Programs: Transport Projects; Security and Emergency Management; Chief Finance Officer; Systems and Information Services; Business and Executive Services; Regional Rail Link; Delivery Coordination.\n\nThe PTSV and the OCI continued as two independent bodies which now reported only to the Minister for Public Transport. The Audit and Assurance function was also a separate office that directly reported to the Secretary of the Department. After the Transport Integration Act was passed, Marine Safety Victoria and Public Safety Victoria merged in 2010 to become Transport Safety Victoria. The statutory authorities linked to both portfolios remained the same as the previous year, with the exception of the Southern Cross Station Authority abolished in 2009 and SEITA which became LMA in 2009.\n\nThe Transport Legislation Amendment (Ports Integration) Act proclaimed in Victorian Government Gazette S329 on 17 August 2010 brought the PoMC and the VRCA under the Transport Integration Act. It also made the PoMC responsible for managing the ports of both Melbourne and Hastings.\n\nUnder section 4 of the Transport Integration Act 2010, Order in Council dated 26 October 2010 the Regional Rail Link Authority was established.\n\nIn January 2011 following the election of the Baillieu Government the Department of Transport reported to the Minister for Ports, the Minister for Public Transport and the Minister for Roads.\n\nThe DOT comprised 10 divisions. The following divisions reported directly to the Secretary of the Department: Public Transport; People and Organisational Development; DOT Legal. The following divisions reported to the Deputy Secretary of Strategic Transport Planning: Finance; Integrated Program Coordination; Community and Place; Freight Logistics and Marine; Transport Planning and Programs; Intergovernmental Relations; Policy and Communications. The Acting Deputy Secretary Programs managed the following programs: Transport Projects; Security and Emergency Management; Systems and Information Services; Business and Executive Services.\n\nPTSV and the OCI remained separate bodies, both reporting to the Minister for Public Transport and the Minister for Roads. Public Transport Safety Victoria also reported to the Minister for Ports. The Audit and Assurance function remained a separate office that directly reported to the Secretary of the Department.\n\nOn 9 April 2013 the Department of Transport II (DOT) (VA 4853) was renamed the Department of Transport, Planning and Local Infrastructure (DOTPLI) (VA 5003) by Order of the Governor-in-Council under section 10 (c) of the Public Administration Act 2004 (Victorian Government Gazette, S 124). The name change was part of machinery-of-government changes made by the Coalition Government under the new leadership of Premier the Hon Dr Denis Napthine MP in April 2013. All functions of the DOT were transferred to the new department."

Similarly all the directions issued by the Director of Gaming and Betting and the Director of Casino Surveillance, and the Rules made by the Victorian Casino and Gaming Authority, continued in force.\n\nThe Government identified six principles against which its gambling policy was to be assessed. As a consequence, the regulation of gambling by the Victorian Commission for Gambling Regulation was be consistent with these principles:\n\n - Developing and reinforcing the Governments commitment to responsible\n gambling through measures that assist and protect problem gamblers and those\n at risk of becoming problem gamblers, their families and the wider community.\n\n - Developing and maintaining the States commitment to the highest standards of\n probity for gambling service providers.\n\n - Accepting gambling is a valid activity for many Victorians who are entitled to\n expect ongoing high standards of service, transparency and accountability\n from the gambling sector.\n\n - Ensuring that the legitimate financial benefits of gambling (both private and\n public) are transparent, appropriately recognisable and fairly distributed to the\n Victorian community.\n\n - That to the extent possible consistent with the other principles, that gaming\n service providers operate in a competitive environment;\n\n - Establishing proper consultative processes to ensure that appropriate information\n is given to, and input is received from, the wide variety of persons interested in\n gambling including stakeholders, affected parties and, to the wider extent\n possible, the broader Victorian community.\n\nThe Victorian Commission for Gambling Regulation, the Director of Liquor Licensing [VA 4824] and Responsible Alcohol Victoria (RAV) were amalgamated to become the Victorian Commission for Gambling and Liqour Regulation [VA 4970]."

Bernard Teague AO (Chairperson) and supported by Commissioners Ron McLeod AM and Susan Pascoe AM were issued by His Excellency's Command, Professor David De Kretser and the Premier of Victoria, John Brumby on the 16 February 2009, to investigate the causes of, preparation for, and responses to the Victorian Bushfires, which swept through parts of Victoria in late January and February 2009 and the impact of the fires on infrastructure.\n\nThe Commission was established for the purposes of inquiring into, and reporting on the following matters:\n\n1. The causes and circumstances of the bushfires which burned in various parts of Victoria in late January and in February 2009 (2009 Bushfires)\n\n2. The preparation and planning by governments, emergency services, other entities, the community and households for bushfires in Victoria, including current laws, policies and practices, resources and strategies for the prevention, identification, evaluation, management and communication of bushfire threats and risks.\n\n3. All aspects of the response to the 2009 Bushfires, particularly measures taken to control the spread of the fires and measures taken to protect life and private and public property, including but not limited to:\n (a) immediate management, response and recovery\n; (b) resourcing, overall coordination and deployment; and\n (c) equipment and communication systems.\n\n4.

The report, released on 17 August, focussed on immediate actions that could be taken before the 2009-2010 fire season. The report represented the completion of six months work, including community consultations, examination of submissions, and public hearings. It contained 51 recommendations.\n\nFollowing publication of the interim report, matters arose in relation to building regulations that the Commission considered warranted action before the release of its final report. As a result, Interim Report 2, Priorities for Building in Bushfire Prone Areas, was released on 24 November 2009. In this second interim report the Commission made seven recommendations regarding the need for a national standard for bushfire bunkers and urgent changes to building standards in bushfire-prone areas.\n\nThis final report was delivered on 31 July 2010 and consisted of four volumes and a summary:\n\n- Volume I, The Fires and the Fire-related Deaths, describes the progress of the fires that burned in Victoria in January and February 2009 and summarises the results of the Commission's inquiries into the 173 associated deaths.\n\n- Volume II, Fire Preparation, Response and Recovery, presents the Commission's conclusions and recommendations in connection with fire preparation, response and recovery.\n\n- Volume III, Establishment and Operation of the Commission-describes how the Commission went about its work.\n\n- Volume IV, The Statements of Lay Witnesses, presents the statements and associated materials of the 100 lay witnesses who shared with the Commission their experiences of the fires.\n\nWinding Up\n\nStaff numbers were gradually reduced once the hearings ended in late May 2010 in the lead up to the Commission's end. The report production team remained during July to manage the production process - editing, layout, proofing and printing.\n\nA small team remained to complete the wind-down, which involved settlement of all financial matters, archiving, cleansing of IT equipment, and the handover of the Commission's accommodation to the Department of Justice.

The functions of Chief Information Officer and Industrial Relations were moved from the Health, and Hospital Services Performance division to the new Finance and Corporate Services division.\n\nIn 2011 the DOH's five organisational divisions were: Health and Hospital Services Performance; Wellbeing, Integrated Care and Ageing; Mental Health, Drugs and Regions; Finance and Corporate Services; Strategy and Policy. The Department's eight geographical regions remained the same.\n\nOn 1 January 2015 the Department of Health III (DOH) (VA 4921) was renamed the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) (VA 5037) by Order of the Governor-in-Council under section 10 of the Public Administration Act 2004 (Victorian Government Gazette, S 432, 4 Dec 2014).

The Waterworks Trust was established to carry out works for the Shires of East Loddon, Korong, Marong and Swan Hill.\n\nThe Order specified that the Trust was to consist of two members each from the East Loddon and Swan Hill councils, and one member from each council of Korong and Marong, and of one other Commissioner. It also specified that the amount of the loan granted to undertake the works was to be 30,000. The Gazette notice also defined the area the Waterworks Trust was to have authority.\n\nUnder the Water Acts, any municipality or group of municipal councils who desired to have waterworks constructed, maintained or continued in or for their municipal districts were to send to the Minister an application for submission to the Governor-in-Council details including a general plan and description of the works for his sanction. Notification of the plan and suggested works were to be published in newspapers and the Government Gazette for at least a month, and proof of this notification was to be supplied to the Minister. If a petition against or for the construction of the works was also created, they were to also be forwarded to the Minister for submission to the Governor-in-Council.\n\nUpon approval of the waterworks constructions, the Governor-in-Council caused a Waterworks Trust to be constituted in order to construct and maintain the works. The Waterworks Trust was a body corporate, had a common seal, was able to own property and land, was able to be sued and to sue, and take out loans. From 1906, the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission (VA 723) were consulted regarding the constitution of each Waterworks Trust, the approval of loans awarded to Trusts and in other matters relating to Waterworks Trusts. The members of a Waterworks Trust could be the members of a Municipal Council if the Waterworks district concerned was wholly or primarily within one municipal district. Waterworks Trust were to consist of commissioners to be elected at regular periods by the council or councils specified by the Order-in-Council which constituted the Waterworks Trust. No more than three commissioners were to be elected by any one council.\n\nWaterworks Trusts were empowered to make and levy rates upon the owners or occupiers of all lands and tenements within its waterworks district in order to meet its loan repayments, maintain its waterworks effectively, extend its waterworks if this was approved by the Governor-in-Council, and pay expenses incurred in performing the acts required by the various Water Acts of Waterworks Trusts. Rates were to be made annually. Waterworks Trusts were to be audited regularly, and were required to keep and maintain accurate accounts. Annual statements were to be made as soon as possible after the 31st of December for each year. A special meeting for the purpose of settling all accounts was to be held two months after the completion of each audit.\n\nWaterworks Trusts could be dissolved upon receipt of a petition signed by the majority of the ratepayers within the district of a waterworks trust by the Governor-in-Council.\n\nThe Loddon United Waterworks Trust was abolished under Water (Loddon) Act on 1st July 1945 and became incorporated into the Mitiamo Waterworks District and the Mitiamo Urban District (Gazette No. 73 29 May 1945)."

The name change was part of machinery-of-government changes made by the Coalition Government under the new leadership of Premier the Hon Dr Denis Napthine MP.\n\nThe new department was to serve as Victoria's lead government agency for sustainable management of water resources, climate change, bushfires, public land, forests and ecosystems. It was formed by bringing together functions from the former DSE (VA 4554) and the former Department of Primary Industries (DPI) (VA 4563). Bringing land and water management together with primary industries was designed to help boost the productivity of Victoria's food and fibre sector. The merger also reorganised the vital role played by land managers and Landcare groups in the protection of the environment and management of natural resources. Functions inherited from the former departments included:\n\n- Land and fire\n- Regional services\n- Natural resources and environment\n- Capital projects\n- Desalination\n- Water\n- Agriculture\n- Productivity and industry development\n- Regulation and compliance\n- Fisheries and game\n- Business services\n\nAt its creation, the Department of Environment and Primary Industries reported to the Minister for Environment and Climate Change and the Minister for Water.

Similarly, the new department inherited most functions of the former DPI except energy and resources, which became the responsibility of the new Department of State Development, Business and Innovation (VA 5001).\nThe new department assisted in delivering the government's vision to position Victoria as a world leader in sustainability and to benefit a diverse range of clients and stakeholders by working together with its service delivery partners, including the following:\n\n- Environment Protection Authority Victoria (VA 1058)\n- Sustainability Victoria\n- Catchment management authorities\n- Parks Victoria (VA 4253)\n- Water authorities\n- Local governments\n\nOn 1 January 2015 DEPI was renamed the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (DELWP) (VA 5036) by Order of the Governor-in-Council under section 10 of the Public Administration Act 2004 (Victorian Government Gazette, S 432, 4 Dec 2014).

    "description": "On 18 July 1995 the Governor in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister for Health, directed that under section 65c of the Health Services Act 1988 the Royal Children's Hospital (RCH) and the Royal Women's Hospital (RWH) be aggregated to form a new hospital known as Women's and Children's Health Care Network ('the Network'). The Network was incorporated under the Health Services Act with effect from 1 August 1995 and the incorporation of the RCH and the RWH cancelled. A new Board of Directors was constituted, consisting of six members including the first Chairperson Lyndsey Cattermole. The aggregation of the two hospitals to form the Network took place under the Kennett Government's strategy for delivering health services in the Melbourne metropolitan area.\n\nThe Network recognised that through the RWH and the RCH it served distinct and different groups of society, the RWH focussed on service provision for women and the newborn and the RCH on service provision for children and adolescents. Both organisations continued to operate under their own names, each with their own Executive Director. The newly constituted Board appointed a Chief Executive Officer and implemented a decentralised management structure. One particular focus was the development of links and partnerships with other networks to improve access to care. In 1997 the Network signed agreements with the North Western Health Care Network to supply women's and children's services at the Sunshine Hospital, and also established collaborative arrangements to establish MH-SKY (Mental Health Services for Youth and Kids) - an integrated mental health service for young people.\n\nOn 1 July 2000, Women's and Children's Health Care Network was replaced by Women's and Children's Health and a new board appointed under section 181 of the Health Services Act 1988.\n\nThe RCH and RWH were disaggregated from Women's and Children's Health and incorporated under the Health Services Act 1988 with new boards of directors on 1 July 2004. Women's and Children's Health continued to exist as a public health service in name, and was exempted from the obligation to publish annual reports by an Order in Council under section 11(1) of the Health Services Act 1988 dated 28 September 2004 (Victoria Government Gazette no. G 40, 30 September 2004).\n\nThe incorporation of Women's and Children's Health was finally cancelled by an Order in Council under 248(1)(e) of the Health Services Act 1988 dated 7 June 2005, effective on 9 June 2005, the date of publication in Victoria Government Gazette no.

    "title": "Allambie Reception Centre",
    "description": "Established to relieve overcrowding at Turana (VA 971) (formerly known as Royal Park Depot), the Allambie Reception Centre (VA 5033) at 70 Elgar Road, Burwood, opened on 1 July 1961 on the former site of the Kildonan Presbyterian Children's Home (1937-circa 1961). When the Allambie nursery commenced operation in 1964, the nursery at Turana was then converted for use by the Youth Welfare Division (YWD). As part of the Children's Home Section of the Social Welfare Branch's Family Welfare Division, Allambie was established under the Children's Welfare Act 1958 on 1 July 1961.\n\nThe Act recommended that the Family Welfare Division (FWD) of the Social Welfare Department establish a range of accommodation services for children who could not be fostered out or find placement within existing voluntary establishments. Allambie became the Department's main 'reception, treatment, classification and transit centre'.\n\nOn average, children stayed between two and three months in accordance with the recommendations of the Children's Welfare Act, which had urged the establishment of a range of accommodation services for infants and children to about age 8-10 years (14 years for girls; boys aged 10-14 years were accommodated at Baltara Reception Centre, Parkville) who could not be fostered out or find placement within existing voluntary establishments.\n\nAllambie functioned as a reception centre for its entire thirty year history (the other three metropolitan centres, Baltara (VA 5090), Winlaton (VA 5093) and Turana (VA 971), had remand or Youth Training Centre functions as well). Allambie's functions also included: emergency care (under special circumstances); safe custody for children awaiting Court decisions; protection and nurturing care for all children (protection applications were normally heard by the Children's Court within a week of admission); participation in assessment and planning for State Wards; and remedial and development work as preparation for the child's return home or to an alternative placement.\n\nChildren who were State Wards also came to Allambie following a breakdown in home release, foster care or a children's home placement. A child's placement was decided upon by the Placement Committee, which met once a week. In 1962, the Committee comprised representatives of the Social Welfare Branch, Chief Secretary's Department (VA 2784) (including the Director of Family Welfare) and Allambie staff (including the Superintendent and Assistant Superintendent, and the Medical Officer).\n\nWhen it opened, Allambie could accommodate up to 90 children in four separate sections. Until the nursery opened at Allambie in 1964, it did not receive babies and toddlers (who had been accommodated in the old nursery at Turana, which was then converted for other use). Allambie functioned as a reception centre throughout its 30 year history.\n\nThe functions and aims of the centre appear to have been reasonably consistent. The stated aims in the 1984 Allambie Action Plan, Information Paper were to:\n\n\"provide purposeful and high-quality care whilst children wait for decisions to be made about appropriate community placement, or for appropriate community placements to become available or where necessary, to facilitate the changes necessary to enable a child to return to their own social environment.\"\n\nIts functions therefore included:\n\n\"...emergency care (under special circumstances); safe custody for children awaiting Court decisions; protection and nurturing care for all children; participation in assessment and case planning for State Wards; and remedial and development work as preparation for the child's return home or to an alternative placement.\"\n\nProtection applications were normally heard by the Children's Court within a week of admission.\n\nThe Education Department operated a special school within Allambie's grounds (VA 3945), although some children attended schools in the community (VPRS 9898). Under the re-named Department of Community Welfare Services (VA 613) (1979-1985), more children were admitted to local schools in 1978/79. A day kindergarten was established just north of the school for 3-4 year olds in 1964. Younger children attended a pre-school centre in the Nursery building and were supervised by a trained kindergarten teacher. An activities officer was appointed in 1964 on a sessional basis and in 1972 this position became full-time and included coordinating a large team of volunteers assisting with activity efforts. Since one of the major aims of Allambie was to reunite children with parents and family, siblings and close relatives were encouraged to maintain contact with resident children.\n\nUntil the 1970s Allambie suffered from overcrowding, severe at times, despite efforts to relieve this situation by the establishment of a number of children's homes and expansions at Allambie itself. Initially Allambie had accommodation for 90 children, for 150 by 1966, 190 in 1970, and for 230 children in 1972. Throughout its history, it provided care for boys up to about 10 years of age, and girls up to age 14.\n\nIn the 1970s, Allambie had three large sections that placed sibling groups together, Waratah, Kurrajong and Mimosa. Other sections included:\n- the Nursery, for babies who were separated from other children for medical reasons\n- Tecoma, for up to 10 school-age boys\n- Heath/Cassia, for 22 adolescent girls\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, there was a significant shortage of suitable options for children and young people, and many stayed at Allambie and Turana for very long periods, worsening overcrowding.\n\nAllambie employed more than 160 childcare staff across 24-hour, seven-day rosters. Additional social work staff undertook casework and planning. Over the 15 year period, the FWD experienced increases in the numbers of children coming to the division as wards or on safe custody orders. At Allambie there were difficulties in finding mental health placements, suitable placements for babies and preschoolers (particularly if they were handicapped), late school-aged girls and boys with behavioural problems, and sibling groups, particularly those which had pre-school members. Despite overall decreases in admissions from the1975/76 period, placements for these groups remained problematic. The average stay of school children was 12 and 14 weeks in 1975/76 and 1976/77 respectively. For pre-schoolers it was 20 and 24 weeks respectively.\n\nFrom 1976, a changing rationale in child care saw placement as a last alternative to other means of family support. Improved family support services were responsible for declining numbers of children being admitted to the care of the Department, and wardship was also increasingly regarded as a last resort.\n\nReorganisation of the department together with the establishment of 3 regional centres and regionalisation of reception care in the 1977/78 period meant operational changes for Allambie, with the reduction of case planning responsibilities at the facility and the regional centres' total assumption of after care responsibilities of children released to their homes.\n\nAt this time, Allambie came under the Residential Child Care section of the new family and Adolescent Services Division. Under the re-named Department of Community Welfare Services (VA 613), more children were admitted to local schools in 1978/79.\n\nIn the 1980s, separation of children from their families and communities came to be considered not only as undesirable, but also as counterproductive. Further regionalisation of reception functions occurred, including the establishment of the Western Suburbs Reception Centre and other smaller centres. The 1985 Statewide Services Redevelopment (SRD) plan focussed on keeping the child or young person in their own region or community by placing them with families whilst court decisions were being made, rather than placing them in one of four metropolitan reception centres. SRD involved utilising resources from central institutions to develop local services and funding was redirected to regional areas.\n\nBy the early 1980s, Allambie accommodated about 100 children. The placement of children with severe social, emotional and mental problems was still a difficulty. Allambie's foreseen closure was delayed by a significant increase in the number of children requiring reception care and protection. The nursery at Allambie closed in 1986. Allambie Reception Centre closed on 30 June 1990. In its place, the department of Community Services Victoria established a number of community residential units, family support programs, and services for young offenders."

    "description": "On 1 January 2015 the Department of Health III (DOH) (VA 4921) was renamed the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) (VA 5037) by Order of the Governor-in-Council under section 10 of the Public Administration Act 2004 (Victorian Government Gazette, S 432, 4 Dec 2014). The name change was part of machinery-of-government changes made by the incoming Labor Government under the leadership of Premier the Hon Daniel Andrews MP, which reduced the number of existing State departments from nine to seven.\n\nThe new department brought together the former Department of Health, Department of Human Services and Sport and Recreation Victoria to align and integrate policymaking, programs and service delivery to improve the wellbeing of all Victorians.\n\nWith the abolition of the Department of Human Services (DHS) (VA 3970), all functions were transferred to DHHS, with the following exceptions: Responsibility for the administration of the Queen Victoria Women's Centre Act 1994 and the Young Women's Christian Association of Australia Incorporation Act 1962 passed from DHS to the Department of Premier and Cabinet DPC (VA 1039) and the Minister for Women. The Queen Victoria Women's Centre was managed by the Queen Victoria Women's Centre Trust whose chairperson was appointed by the Minister and whose members were appointed by the Governor in Council on the recommendation of the Minister. The Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) advocated for affordable and appropriate housing for women, sexual and reproductive health rights and ending violence against women. It also ran a large network of rooming houses and women's shelters in partnership with the Victorian Government.\n\nResponsibility for the Abortion Reform Act 2008 passed from the former DHS to DPC and the Act became jointly and severally administered by the Minister for Health and the Minister for Women (see General Order signed by the Premier on 4 Dec 2014).\n\nFrom the former Department of State Development, Business and Administration, DHHS assumed responsibility for administration of the Howard Florey Institute of Experimental Physiology and Medicine (Repeal) Act 2007 and the Medical Research Institutes Repeal Act 2008. These Acts relate to a number of medical research institutes originally established under Victorian Government legislation which by repeal were enabled to amalgamate with other research bodies. The research institutes included the Howard Florey Institute, Prince Henry's Institute and Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute. These institutes continued to receive substantial financial support from the Victorian Government (and other sources), however with the change of government following the 2014 election, government interest in these bodies was transferred from the Minister for Technology to the Minister for Health.\n\nThe portfolio of Sport (as Sport and Recreation Victoria) was transferred to DHHS from the abolished Department of Transport, Planning and Local Infrastructure (VA 5003), except for major sporting events, which became part of the Tourism and Major Events portfolio supported by the Department of Economic Development, Jobs, Transport and Resources (VA 5034).\n\nAs at February 2014, DHHS supported the following portfolios:\n\n- Health\n- Ambulance Services\n- Families and Children\n- Housing, Disability and Ageing\n- Mental Health\n- Sport (except for major sporting events)\n- Youth Affairs\n\nMajor administrative groups and divisions at the time of transition to DHHS were,\n\nfrom Health:\n\n- Commission for Hospital Improvement\n- Corporate Services\n- Health Service Performance and Programs\n- Health Strategy, Productivity and Analytics\n- Mental Health, Wellbeing and Ageing\n- Office of Chief Advisors\n- Regulation Health Protection and Regions\n\nand from Human Services:\n\n- Community and Executive Services Group\n- Financial and Corporate Services\n- Policy and Strategy Group\n- Service Design and Implementation Group\n- Social Housing and National Disability Insurance Scheme Reform\n- East, West, North and South Divisions\n- Melbourne Metropolitan Offices (19)\n\nAlso associated with the department were various portfolio agencies and also charities and non-government bodies receiving financial support from the Victorian government.\n\nOn 1 March 2016, DHHS acquired responsibility of the following Act, as per the Victorian Government Gazette, No. S 44, 8 March 2016:\n- Housing Act 1983 - Division 6 of Part VIII (responsibility was transferred from Department of Treasury and Finance (VA 3745))."

These make up the six portfolios. Its primary functions were reform, administration and enforcement of the law in Victoria, including all police and prosecution functions, administration of the Court system, provision of the prison system, administration of various tribunals established to protect citizens' right, provision of emergency services, drafting of legislation, and provision of legal advice to Government.\n\nDJR's authorities included Sentencing Advisory Council, and productive partnerships with more than 60 statutory entities.\n\nDJR had eight divisions: Civil Justice, Corporate Governance and Infrastructure, Corrections, Criminal Justice, Emergency Management, People and Stakeholders, Regulation, and Service Strategy Reform.\n\nDJR had four areas, comprising: North Area (Loddon Mallee and Hume regions); North West Metropolitan Area; South Area (South East Metropolitan and Gippsland regions); and West Area (Barwon South West and Grampians regions)."

    "title": "Royal Commission into Family Violence",
    "description": "The Royal Commission into Family Violence (RCFV) was established by Letters Patent issued by the Governor of Victoria, on advice from the Premier of Victoria, on Sunday 22nd February 2015. The Letters Patent appointed The Hon. Marcia Ann Neave AO as Commissioner and Chairperson, and Ms Patricia Mary Faulkner AO and Mr Anthony Joseph Nicholson as Deputy Commissioners.\n\nThe Commission's purpose was to inquire into and report on how Victoria's response to family violence can be improved by providing practical recommendations to stop family violence. It was the first royal commission to be established and conducted under the Inquiries Act 2014.\n\nThe terms of reference required the Commission to do the following:\n- examine and evaluate strategies, frameworks, policies, programs and services and establish best practice for four areas-the prevention of family violence; early intervention to identify and protect those at risk of family violence and prevent the escalation of family violence; support for victims of family violence and measures to redress the impacts on victims, particularly on women and children; and accountability for perpetrators of family violence\n- investigate means of ensuring systemic responses to family violence, particularly in the legal system and by police, corrections, child protection, legal and family violence support services; including reducing re-offending and changing violent and controlling behaviours\n- investigate how government agencies and community organisations can better integrate and coordinate their efforts\n- make recommendations on how best to evaluate and measure the success of strategies and programs put in place to stop family violence.\n\nThe Commission was also asked to consider the need to establish a culture of non-violence and gender equity and the needs and experiences of all those affected by family violence-among them children; older people; Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities; culturally and linguistically diverse communities; gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender and intersex communities; regional, rural and remote communities; and people with disabilities and complex needs. In addition, the Commission was asked to consider the necessity for short, medium and long-term solutions to the problem of family violence and the need for coordination across jurisdictions.\n\nThe Commission's processes involved the following facets:\n- Submissions. The Commission called for written submissions responding to its terms of reference and fixed a closing date of 29 May 2015. On 31 March 2015 the Commission released an issues paper to guide organisations and individuals in the preparation of their submissions. No format was prescribed for the submissions: they could be typed or handwritten and lodged through the Commission's website or provided by email, post or hand delivery. In all, 968 submissions were received. Of these, 491 were from individuals and 477 were from organisations. After the submissions had been read and analysed, and requests for confidentiality or anonymity taken into account, the majority of submissions were published on the Commission's website.\n- Community consultations. The Commission held most of its community consultation sessions between 21 April and 7 July 2015. Nearly 850 people attended the 44 consultation sessions, which were held in 21 locations in metropolitan Melbourne and regional Victoria. They included individuals who had experienced family violence as well as representatives of organisations working in the family violence system. Generally, people attending the sessions were invited to choose their preferred topic of discussion-prevention and early intervention or safety and accountability. The topics were then discussed in small groups, each group being asked to consider three or four questions. As with the other sessions, the commissioners moved from table to table to listen and ask questions.\n- Briefings and site visits. The Commission received informal briefings from experts and visited a range of organisations during the course of its inquiry. The Commissioner spent an afternoon and evening following a police van and observing how Victoria Police members respond to family violence incidents. Both Deputy Commissioners also spent time speaking to police members at different stations and observing general police duties and police family violence teams.\n- Public hearings. Twenty-five days of public hearings were held during a four-week period in July-August 2015 and a week in October 2015. Two-hundred and twenty individual witnesses gave evidence, sometimes on multiple occasions. Many witnesses appeared as members of panels; 13 witnesses appeared via video link and two by telephone. The hearings were organised around 23 modules that focused on specific topics but did not cover or purport to cover all the matters to be considered by the Commission.\n- Roundtable discussions. The Commission held six roundtable discussions on specific topics in the period between the two blocks of public hearings. Each roundtable discussion was attended by between six and 11 participants, as well as commissioners and staff of the Commission. Among the participants were judges, magistrates, academics, current and former representatives of government agencies, policy-makers and service providers.\n- Commissioned research. Two pieces of research were commissioned - a report on family violence trends in Victoria from 2009-10 to 2013-14; and a report on the impact of family violence proceedings in the Magistrates' Court of Victoria.\n\nThe Commission was originally asked to report its findings and recommendations to the Governor of Victoria by 29 February 2016. On 23 December 2015, following a request by the Commission, the Governor amended the Letters Patent to extend the reporting date to 29 March 2016. The Royal Commission into Family Violence report was tabled in Parliament on 30 March 2016.\n\nAfter the Commission concluded its work and findings, its functions were transferred to the Department of Premier and Cabinet (VA 1039), as required by the Inquiries Act 2014."

    "description": "In the late 1920s, the private home Ambermere in Shepparton, became a private hospital and operated mainly as an out-patient clinic for psychiatric patients.\n\nIn 1967, clinical services were established at Ambermere Psychiatric Clinic, auspiced by the Mooroopna Base Hospital. A Psychiatrist Superintendent was appointed to oversee out-patient treatment and also treat in-patients at Mooroopna Base Hospital.\n\nTwo sessions were held every fortnight, and a steady flow of new referrals continued to be seen, as well as a considerable number of reviews of patients previously treated. A part-time social worker was also consulted at Ambermere.\n\nThroughout 1968, one outpatient session was held per week at the Mooroopna Base Hospital. Many inpatients of the Base Hospital received treatment from the Psychiatrist Superintendent of Ambermere in his capacity as Honorary Visiting Psychiatrist to the Base Hospital.\n\nOnly outpatients continued to be assessed and treated at Ambermere. Building renovations continued throughout 1968. The new combined occupational therapy and outpatients building was completed in November, and during December the clinic activities were transferred to this building.\n\nIn late August 1968 a full-time Secretary, akin to an executive officer, was appointed to Ambermere, allowing for much more detailed planning for the future development of the unit. Day-to-day administration became more flexible and efficient than had previously been possible when Ambermere depended on periodic visits from the Secretary at Beechworth mental Hospital (VA 2842).\n\nIn 1968, Ambermere had no medical staff apart from the Psychiatrist Superintendent. In 1969, Ambermere and the other clinics held regularly at Mooroopna, Echuca and Benalla, had nearly 3,000 out-patient attendances, with about 400 new cases. During that year a Medical Officer was appointed to take over a number of cases requiring repeated visits to the clinic.\nAmbermere was able to offer in-patient treatment when a 20 bed patient unit opened on 1 July 1970.\n\nThe Psychiatrist Superintendent continued to see all new referrals, as well as all patients at the outlying clinics. An occupational therapy program was established during the year, and two charge nurses were appointed to work with the occupational therapist, conduct domiciliary visits in association with the social workers, and perform general clinic duties.\n\nOnce a full-time social worker and a case aide were appointed, it was possible to establish the elements of a day hospital. The Echuca and Benalla Clinics continued to be conducted twice per fortnight.\n\nIn 1987, Ambermere Hospital, Shepparton became an approved psychiatric hospital. In 1995, this approval was revoked and 'transferred' to the Ambermere Unit, Goulburn Valley Base Hospital.\n\nIn 1996, Ambermere closed after it ceased to be an approved psychiatric unit."

    "description": "Gresswell Tuberculosis Sanatorium for males was built in 1929, but due to financial constraints, opened in 1933. Gresswell sat on the grounds of Mont Park Hospital (VA 2846), in Macleod. Gresswell was surrounded by Gresswell Forest, with an area of 52 ha of Crown land, as a buffer zone around the Mont Park Hospital as patients needed to be isolated from surrounding housing.\n\nGresswell was named after Dr Dan Astley Gresswell, public medical administrator of the Board of Public Health from 18941904. The aim of Gresswell was to combat tuberculosis during the 1930s. The last tuberculosis patient was admitted to Gresswell Sanatorium in April 1970.\n\n\nIn May 1970, Gresswell Sanatorium was transferred to the Mental Health Branch and became the Gresswell Rehabilitation Centre for male alcoholic and drug dependent patients.\n\nIn 1970, Gresswell began admitting alcoholic patients, and accepting cases from Royal Park, Larundel, Mont Park and Plenty Hospitals. A total of 48 patients were admitted to two 24-bed wards.\n\n\nGresswell Sanatorium later became Gresswell Drug and Alcohol Rehabilitation Centre, in c.1974, under the guidance of Drug Services Victoria. It was an 'Alcohol and Drug Dependent Persons Services Branch', as a result of the Vagrancy (Insufficient Means) Bill 1974, which was a Bill to amend Section 5 of the Vagrancy Act 1966. The amendment allowed an alternative method of dealing with such persons considered also to be alcoholic, drug-dependent, in need of medical, psychiatric or nursing treatment, or otherwise in need of care and protection. It allowed those individuals to be referred to assessment centres, such as Gresswell, for treatment under the provisions of the Alcoholics and Drug-dependent Persons Act 1968. Gresswell Drug and Alcohol Rehabilitation Centre opened as an alcohol and drug rehabilitation facility with around 140 beds, allowing for approximately 500 people per year to be treated at the facility.\n\n\nUntil 1990, funding for alcohol and drug services in Victoria concentrated on four large government alcohol and drug centres that were geographically isolated, provided limited access for clients and were not linked to other alcohol and drug and health and welfare services (Pleasant View Centre, Smith Street Clinic, Gresswell Rehabilitation Centre and Heatherton Hospital Alcohol and Drug Unit).\n\nGresswell closed as a drug and alcohol rehabilitation centre in June 1995. Funding was subsequently redistributed across the state for the establishment of community-based drug withdrawal services, specialist methadone services and specialist counselling and support positions."

The Mental Health Act 1959 (No.6605) designated hospitals providing short-term diagnosis and accommodation as \"psychiatric hospitals\". Therefore any institution could have a section designated as a mental hospital for long-term or indefinite hospitalization and a section designated as a psychiatric hospital for short term diagnosis and treatment of acute psychiatric illness. Any such designations of particular wards are published in the Government Gazette.\n\nPatients could not be retained without a warrant requesting their admission. Prior to 1867 the warrant was signed by the Governor. After this date the Chief Secretary (VRG 26) was responsible for this function. From 1934 the Director of Mental Hygiene (VA 2865) and from 1952 the Chief Medical Officer of the Mental Hygiene Branch (VA 2866) were successively responsible for admission of patients.\nHobson Park Hospital is referred to as an informal hospital in annual reports of the Mental Hygiene Authority and Mental Health Authority until 1971, with the annual reports showing that only informal (voluntary) patients were admitted to Hobson Park.\nFrom 1 September 1971 the land and buildings known as Hobson Park Hospital was formally renamed Traralgon Mental Hospital with the exception of the building known as Ward 1, which became Traralgon Psychiatric Hospital.

It was established to treat patients diagnosed with consumption/tuberculosis. It was affiliated with the nearby Melbourne Benevolent Asylum (later the Kingston Centre). The two facilities were linked by an electric tram, from the 1920s until the 1940s, after the end of World War II. In the late 1940s, the Commonwealth Government Health Department took over the Heatherton Sanatorium.\n\nBy 1953, with the additon of a five storey hostel for nursing staff on-site, the facility was fully self sufficient and housed around 260 patients. In 1958, Prince Henry's Hospital was offered the use of part of the Heatherton facilities as a convalescent hospital, as tuberculosis patient numbers declined. A state primary school, no. 4982, operated to meet the needs of young patients.\n\nIn 1974 the facility became a 'Alcohol and Drug Dependent Persons Services Branch', that took over two wings of the hospital.

    "description": "Larundel Mental Hospital was proclaimed as an independent mental hospital in 1953. Its proclamation as a Mental Hospital was published in the Government Gazette on June 10, 1953 (No. 497, p. 2857). It was located on Plenty Road, Bundoora.\n\nA mental hospital was any public building proclaimed by the Governor-in-Council and published in the Government Gazette as a place for the reception of lunatics. A mental hospital could also provide wards for the temporary reception of patients as well as long term patients. Until the Mental Health Act 1959 (No.6605) came into operation in 1962 these \"short term\" wards were known as \" receiving houses\". The Mental Health Act 1959 designated hospitals providing short term diagnosis and accommodation as \"psychiatric hospitals\". Any institution could have a section designated as a mental hospital for long-term or indefinite hospitalisation and a section designated as a psychiatric hospital for short-term diagnosis and treatment of acute psychiatric illness. Any such designation of particular wards are published in the Government Gazette. Hence some sections at Larundel were designated as a mental hospital and some sections as a psychiatric hospital.\n\nAlthough the first patients arrived in 1949, Larundel was not officially proclaimed as a separate mental hospital until June 10, 1953. At this time, five wards, previously known as the Farm Worker's Block at Mont Park (VA 2846), were incorporated into Larundel. Larundel housed 387 patients, a quarter of which were female. In 1955, eight additional wards opened, allowing for another 360 patients, of which 270 were female.\n\nBy the early 1970s, Larundel had wards dealing with psychological illnesses such as acute psychiatrics, chronic schizophrenics, chronic psychotics and geriatric patients. A clinical laboratory had also been added.\n\nLarundel continued its own administration until the formation of North Eastern Metropolitan Psychiatric Services (commonly known as NEMPS) (VA 5083) in 1991. Larundel continued to operate under the administration of NEMPS until 1999, when Larundel closed. Many of Larundel's patients were then transferred to Austin Hospital (VA 1243).\n\nThroughout its operation Larundel may also have been known colloquially as Larundel Mental Asylum and Larundel Hospital, although these names are not specified in any relevant Government Gazettes.\n\nPrior to its proclamation as a mental hospital in 1953 the site at Larundel was administered by Mont Park (VA 2846). Larundel began housing mental health patients on November 21, 1949, when thirty male patients were transferred from Mont Park, with other wards being opened progressively and female patients first being transferred in May 1952. Prior to this, the facility was conceived in 1938, began being built in 1940, was taken over by RAAF in 1942, was a WAAF training depot from 1943-1945, and from 1946-1949 provided emergency accommodation for the Department of Housing."

    "description": "North Eastern Metropolitan Psychiatric Services (commonly known as NEMPS) was formed on 19 August 1991. It took over administration of the following three mental health and psychiatric facilities: Larundel Psychiatric Hospital (VA 5082), Mont Park Hospital (VA 2846) and Plenty Hospital (VA 5091), to become an approved psychiatric hospital, under the Mental Health Act 1986.\n\nNEMPS underwent development from 1994-1995, over the following four years. It aimed to see the movement of 575 beds from the Bundoora campus to mainstream hospitals and community services across metropolitan Melbourne. This was part of the Government's redevelopment of mental health services in Victoria from a largely institutional base to a community-based service model.\n\nNEMPS was closed on 4 February 1998, upon the revocation of the proclamation as an approved mental health service."

    "description": "\nConstruction\n\nIn late 1993, the Turana Youth Training Centre (VA 971) closed for the construction of the new Melbourne Youth Justice Centre (at the time called Melbourne Juvenile Justice Centre or MJJC), located on the same site at 900 Park Street, Parkville.\n\nThe young people from Turana were transferred to the newly constructed MJJC complex within a secure perimeter, with four 15-bed accommodation units, a program and recreation facility, and a reception area.\n\nThe MJJC was fully operational by April 1994 and accommodated the following groups:\n- 15-17-year-old males who were remanded or sentenced by the Children's Court\n- 17-21-year-old males who were sentenced by an adult court.\n\nThe Senior Youth Training Centre\n\nThe Senior Youth Training Centre or Classification A (Class A) Unit accommodated a maximum of 24 young men on sentences from an adult court under the dual-track system.\n\nThe four accommodation units included:\n- Remand for those awaiting court dates\n- Westgate for those with either short-term sentences or considered a low security risk and able to participate in outings\n- Southbank for those with medium to long-term sentences\n- Eastern Hill the maximum security section for those with long-term sentences who are considered a security or absconding risk.\n\nIn addition, the site included the Senior Youth Training Centre, previously called Classification A Unit, for offenders aged 17-20 years who had been ordered by an adult court to serve their sentence there instead of imprisonment. This unit had not been upgraded during the redevelopment, and was demolished in 2002.\n\nIn 1999, 10 beds were established for the Senior Youth Training Centre at the Acheron Bush Camp site near Buxton, 120 kilometres northeast of Melbourne - a low security accommodation option. A small group of six to 10 young men were classified to Acheron, an open campsite with no physical perimeter security provisions.\n\nThe Acheron Bush Camp closed in 2008. In 2004, a new 26-bed remand unit was established at the MJJC.\n\nChange of Name\n\nThe Children, Youth and Families Act 2005 repealed most of the Children and Young Persons Act 1989. On 23 April 2007, the name of the young offender programs changed from 'juvenile justice' to 'youth justice'. The Melbourne Juvenile Justice Centre was renamed the Melbourne Youth Justice Centre (MYJC).\n\n1n 2009 the Melbourne Youth Justice Centre became part of the Parkville Youth Justice Precinct that comprises two separate custodial centres: Parkville Youth Residential Centre (930 Park Street, Parkville); and Melbourne Youth Justice Centre (900 Park Street, Parkville). As part of the same precinct, both centres have been able to maximise the efficient use of support services for their clients.\n\nThe MYJC remains an operational facility for sentenced youth.\n\nLegislation and record keeping\n\nThe Children and Young Persons Act 1989 replaced the terms 'ward of state' (introduced by the Neglected Children's Act 1887) and 'trainee' (introduced by the Social Welfare Act 1960), with the new term, 'children in need of protection'. The old terminology was phased out in the 1990s, whereafter both child protection cases and sentenced young people were classified as 'clients'.\n\nYoung people who entered into the youth justice system before implementation of the 1989 Act, kept their trainee case history files, and not the later Client Relationship Information System institutional files (JJ CRIS prefix). This explains why the older records continued until the late 1990s, well after the terminology had changed.\n\nThe term 'client' is still used for all care leavers in Victoria."

    "description": "The Mental Treatment Act 1915 had allowed for ex-service patients to obtain mental health treatment voluntarily . In 1915 a ward at Mont Park (VA 2846) was taken over as a Convalescent Military Hospital. An agreement was made with the Defence Department for the latter to erect the Mont Park central block for use as a Military Hospital. This hospital was generally referred to as the Military Mental Hospital or the Military Mental Block, and primarily catered for ex-military personnel with chronic psychiatric illness.\n\nThere was also a hospital variously known as the Bundoora Farm or Homestead or the Repatriation Mental Hospital built on or near the current site of the Bundoora Repatriation Hospital.\n\nIn April 1920, the Commonwealth bought Bundoora Park - 600 acres with a substantial homestead and various cottages, sheds and stables. The combined facility became Mont Park Military Mental Wards - a halfway house between treatment and discharge. It aimed to treat returned soliders suffering from trauma and mental illness as a result of their war service through the provision of fresh air and gentle farm work.\n\nIn 1923, the property was transferred to the Repatriation Commission and in 1924 the Bundoora Homestead (initially known as Bundoora Convalescent Farm, sometimes the Bundoora Park Curative Farm) was opened as Hospital Ward 2. These changes were due to the growing patient numbers and awareness of their need for complex, long term care.\n\nThe Bundoora Park Homestead, the principle building of the repatriation facility, later became an arts centre. The building, located on Snake Gully Road, Bundoora, was originally built for racing identity John Matthew Vincent Smith, completed in 1900. It was purchased by the Government, specifically the Repatriation Commission, in 1920.\n\nThe construction of the separate military mental health facility, away from Mont Park (VA 2846), was in response to pressure from returned servicemen's organisations to protect shell-shocked patients from the stigma of mental illness by removing them from the general psychiatric patient population in Mont Park. The military block at Mont Park was closed in 1924 and handed back to the State for civilian mental cases.\n\nThe Victoria Gazette (No. 175, Wednesday October 8, 1924, p. 3175) proclaimed that the institution, to be known as 'Repatriation Mental Hospital \"B\"', was \"to be exclusively used for the reception, care, and treatment of mental patients\", to take effect from the 1st April, 1924. In October, 1924 the Mont Park facility was named Repatriation Mental Hospital \"A\", and the Bundoora site named Repatriation Mental Hospital \"B\".\n\nThe Victoria Gazette (No. 74, Wednesday April 12, 1933, p. 1183) proclaimed to revoke the above proclaimation made in October 1924, and the institution was to be then known as 'Repatriation Mental Hospital, Bundoora' (VA 2846), as \"an institution to be exclusively used for the reception, care, and treatment of mental treatment patients\".\n\nIn 1933 all the military patients from Mont Park were transferred to the Bundoora Repatriation Mental Hospital. Over the years eight more wards were built, giving the hospital a capacity of 291 beds by 1968.\n\nIn 1950 the hospital had 200 patients. Only patients who had an entitlement for psychiatric disorder due to war service were admitted. Many patients were admitted and discharged more than once, some up to 15 times over a period of years. Bundoora Repatriation Hospital benefitted from active volunteers, especially from the Red Cross and Returned Servicemen's League.\n\nFrom approximately 1984-93, the Bundoora Repatriation Hospital (VA 2846) was jointly funded by the Office of Psychiatric Services and Department of Veteran Affairs under a State/Commonwealth agreement. Returned servicemen with mental health issues were cared for at the Bundoora Repatriation Hospital until its official closure in October 1993.\n\nBundoora Repatriation Hospital, including Wards 6 and 7, was de-commissioned in 1992-1993, as the Victorian Government Gazette (G 41, 21 October 1992, p. 3107) revoked the proclamation under section 94 (1) of the Mental Health Act 1986 of the facility as an approved psychiatric hospital."

    "title": "Baltara Reception Centre",
    "description": "Early Years\n\nIn October 1968, the Baltara Reception Centre was established on the site of the former Parkside section, at the Turana Youth Training Centre (VA 971), in Parkville. Prior to the opening of Baltara, the Turana Reception Centre (official title from Social Welfare Department Annual Reports) was located in another section of the complex.\n\nBoth Baltara and its predecessor Turana Reception Centre were administered by the Family Welfare Division, Social Welfare Branch, Chief Secretary's Department (VA 2784). The Youth Welfare Division administered the Youth Training Centre that was part of the same complex.\n\nThe Baltara Reception Centre incorporated both Parkside and three other new sections that were given Aboriginal names: Kinta meaning laughter; Mawarra meaning a pleasant place; Warrina meaning place of rest. Names of persons were considered undesirable because their meaning would be lost with the passage of time. Another residential unit, completed in 1970, was given the name Akora meaning dwelling.\n\nThe Baltara Reception Centre was part of the same campus as the Turana Youth Training Centre but operated as a separate entity. Baltara's officer in charge reported to Turana's superintendent.\n\nBaltara initially provided interim accommodation for boys aged 10-14 years whose family relations or social situation were such as to require intervention from the Children's Court. The boys were either awaiting a court appearance or were wards awaiting adoption or placement in foster care, family group homes, children's homes or mental health facilities. Their stays varied from a few weeks to several months, depending on the complexity of their court cases and the availability of other placements. The centre also acted as a remand centre for boys in the same age group.\n\nThe boys were admitted to Baltara for study and classification with the objective of determining a program of treatment or care based on their needs, and the children's homes to which they should be transferred. Their duration of stay varied from a few weeks to several months, depending on the complexity of the court case and the availability of placements. In the late 1970s, Baltara also began functioning as a long term facility, mainly catering for boys who had previously experienced unsuccessful placements or breakdowns in home release.\n\nWhilst at Baltara, the boys undertook a program that was strongly focussed on community oriented rehabilitation, involving trained child care officers and teaching staff from the Education Department. In its initial stages, Baltara had a seven classroom school. In 1973 three new classrooms were added, enabling the development of a domestic science program and extension of art and craft activities. Other facilities added over the years included an indoor games centre, a sports oval, a swimming pool and an adventure playground. These facilities allowed for the development of many programs, including badminton, judo, gym and mini-bike activities.\n\n In 1972, child care staff commenced an after-care service for boys returned to their families from Baltara. This allowed for continuity in staff-child relationships and helped many boys make a success of their return to the community. The year 1972 also saw the establishment of several hobby clubs and an expansion of the camping program. In 1983-1984, a new section called The Oaks was added and it ran a diversion program for appropriate boys. In 1985-1986, an Individual Treatment Program centred on The Oaks Section was developed. The Oaks program provided intensive care for a small number of boys with social and intellectual disabilities.\n\nBy January 1970, due to its number of admissions, Baltara had become one of the largest institutions of its type in Victoria. Overcrowding had become a problem. In the early 1970s, Baltara established its own school and administration block, reinforcing its separation from Turana.\n\nIn 1973, three new classrooms were added. Also added over the years was an indoor games centre, a sports oval, a swimming pool and an adventure playground.\nIn the late 1970s, Baltara began to function as a long-term facility, mainly catering for boys who had experienced unsuccessful placements or breakdowns in home release.\n\nBy 1975, Baltara had the following sections:\n- Parkside - security and remand.\n- Warrawong - open/semi-security placement, remand, and internal classification of boys not needing a full security placement at Parkside.\n- Alkoomi (new section created from a wing of Parkside) - halfway house between Parkside and open section for older boys not needing long-term placement but needing group counselling and activities before home release.\n- Akora - boys on home release expected to make an early adjustment back to the community.\n- Kinta - remands and wards awaiting transfer to children's homes.\n- Mawarra - state wards (often long term) with complex needs who faced difficulties being placed in children's homes.\n\nIn the late 1970s, Baltara underwent a process of change whereby it reviewed the functions and use of its facilities. One section was diverted for the purposes of remand and assessment, two sections continued to be used for boys working towards home release or placement, and the fourth section started being used for security.\n\nBaltara 1980s\n\nIn 1981-82, a new early adolescent unit housed eight wards of the state from Baltara Reception Centre who progressed to more long-term placements in hostels or other units in the community. The after-care service was also phased out and transferred to regional centres, which were now preferred over metropolitan institutions.\n\nIn the 1980s, separation of children from their families and communities became widely regarded as not only undesirable, but counterproductive. Rather than placing children in large central institutions, multiple small, geographically dispersed, short-term residential units were established in neighbourhood settings. Youth and child welfare facilities statewide were redeveloped as an alternative to metropolitan institutions.\n\nFinal years and closure\n\nThe Children and Young Persons Act 1989 established different divisions in the Children's Court to completely separate child protection matters from criminal/custodial matters. The Act also instigated separation of service provision for children and young people on protective orders and young offenders in custody. In September 1991, the proclamation of the Children and Young Person's Act 1989, led to Baltara's closure the following year.\n\nThe Department of Community Services channeled resources that had previously gone to Baltara, into a network of small-scale, geographically-dispersed, community-based residential and reception units, including secure welfare services and short- and medium-term housing.\n\nBaltara closed in 1992, and its residents were transferred to the Nunawading Youth Residential Centre. The Parkville Youth Residential Centre was developed on the site of the former Baltara Reception Centre.\n\nWhen the Nunwading Youth Residential Centre closed in 1993, residents were moved to Parkville Youth Residential Centre.\n\nLegislation\n\nThe Children and Young Persons Act 1989 required that the provision of services for children and young people on protective orders be separated from those provided to young offenders in custody. The Act established different divisions in the Children's Court to completely separate child protection matters from criminal custodial matters.\n\nThe 1989 Act also established the term 'children in need of protection', replacing old terms 'ward of state' (from the Neglected Children's Act 1887) and 'trainee' (from the Social Welfare Act 1960). Children and young people involved with child protection and sentenced young people are now all classified as 'clients'.\n\nYoung people who entered the youth justice system before the 1989 Act was implemented, kept their trainee case history files, but not the later Client Relationship Information System institutional files (JJ CRIS prefix). This explains why the older records continued until the late 1990s - well after the terminology had changed.\n\nThe term 'client' is still used for all care leavers in Victoria."

    "description": "In 1956, Winlaton Girls' Training Centre was established as the main state institution for adolescent girls, situated on a 20-acre property at 186 Springvale Road, Nunawading. The land's previous owner, philanthropist Mr Joseph Tweddle, named it Winlaton after his birthplace. In 1991, Winlaton was renamed the Nunawading Youth Residential Centre (VA 5214).\n\nWinlaton was established under the Children's Welfare Act 1954, that abolished the Department for Reformatory Schools, Chief Secretary's Department (VA 2963),and transferred the responsibility for juvenile offenders and reformatory schools (from 1954 known as juvenile schools), to the Children's Welfare Department.\n\nAlthough Winlaton was established to be a juvenile school, on the plaque commemorating the opening at the centre it was called a \"Girls' Training Centre\". In the Children's Welfare Department's annual reports for its first few years, Winlaton was referred to as a \"Juvenile School\", \"Girls' Training Centre\" and \"Girl's Training School\".\n\nBefore Winlaton, Catholic girls were placed at the Abbotsford and Oakleigh convents of the Good Shepherd. Protestant girls were accommodated at the Remand and Reformatory Section of the Royal Park Depot for Boys and Girls, which became Turana in 1955.\n\nWinlaton housed female juvenile offenders detained by the courts, as well as young women who had not committed a crime.\n\nIn 1956, the Social Welfare Department set out the objectives of Winlaton in its annual report:\n'Winlaton's objectives are, broadly, to teach a girl:- (i) How to live as a well-adjusted, self-reliant member of the community; (ii) a craft or skill; (iii) how to use her leisure hours; (iv) to know and care for herself and, indeed, to care for others later on as a home-maker.'\n\nGirls were accommodated in five cottages/residential sections at Winlaton, each housing the girls in single rooms. The cottages were known as 'Warrina', 'Kooringal' and 'Goonyah', in addition to Leawarra Hostel and Winbirra Remand Centre. The function of each section was:\n\nWarrina section -\nWas used as an assessment centre. When they were admitted to Winlation, girls were housed on this section for 6-8 weeks while it was determined whether Goonyah or Karingal was the most suitable place for them to reside for the remainder of their sentence. It could house 22 girls was located within the compound.\n\nKaringal section -\nWas used as a residence for younger and more tractable gilrs. It could house 22 girls and was located within the compound.\n\nGoonyah section -\nWas used as a residence for older and more difficult girls. It could house 20 girls and was located within the compound.\n\nLeawarra Hostel -\nWas a low security pre-release unit. Its function was to enable girls to learn living and coping skills in order to make a successful transition to the community. It also had a self-contained flat where girls were able to practice living in such an environment. Girls residing at the hostel were able to attend local schools and have outside employment. Leawarra had 17 bedrooms and was located outside the main compound.\n\nWinbirra Remand Centre -\nWas a high security remand centre for 14-21 year old girls who were awaiting court apperances after being charged with offences or placed on a protection or uncontrollable application. Occasionally, it was also used to house wards on short-term placements, when it was felt inappropriate to place them with the other residents. The Social Welfare Act 1970 allows for the placement of young people requiring protection with young people charged or found guilty of offences in remand centres.\n\nThe Social Welfare Department described the system at Winlaton in 1956: 'Promotion is made from one cottage to another. Conversely, of course, demotion occurs sometimes'.\n\nBy 1957, Winlaton had up to 60 girls living in accommodation designed for 45 girls.\n\nBy 1959, Winlaton had a juvenile school, a reception centre (Winbirra) and a hostel (Leawarra). Within the main secure compound, girls lived in three cottages (Warrina, Goonyah and Kooringal (Karingal), each with up to 15 girls in single rooms.\n\nYoung women stayed in Warrina for six to eight weeks to be assessed, then moved to Goonyah or Karingal depending on their needs. Warrina could house 22 girls. Karingal had capacity for 22 girls and also housed most of the wards of the state.\n\nIn June 1957, Goonyah became a reception centre for 20 young women aged 14 to 21 years. Both sentenced girls and wards of the state lived in Goonyah.\n\nIn 1959, the Leawarra Girls' Hostel was added as the centre's pre-release unit. It was a minimum security section located outside the main compound and operated from December 1959-92. It also accommodated wards of state as well as sentenced female trainees nearing release.\n\nYoung women in Leawarra learned independent living skills for transition to the community. Sentenced young women were housed on the north side, and wards of the state on the south side. Those in employment or outside education used Leawarra as a halfway house.\n\nWinlaton in the 1960s to 70s:\n\nFrom early 1960, the Winbirra building housed the reception centre, a high-security section outside but adjacent to the compound that was administered by Winlaton. It was also a remand centre for young women aged 14 to 21 who had been charged with criminal offences awaiting court, as well as those on protection orders. From the 1960s, gradual de-institutionalisation, combined with a commitment to diversion in juvenile justice, significantly reduced the numbers of young people detained.\n\nOn 1 July 1961, under the Social Welfare Act 1960, two of the divisions in the newly established Social Welfare Branch took control of the juvenile schools and reception centres. The control of reception centres came under the new Family Welfare Division and the control of juvenile schools under the new Youth Welfare Division. Under this Act the juvenile schools were renamed \"Youth Training Centres\", and were formally appointed as such by the Governor in Council. The renaming of the former juvenile schools was gazetted on the 9 May 1962.\n\nThe Winlaton Youth Training Centre for girls (aged 14-21 years) had a population of about 100 in the mid-1970s, which reduced to about 70 in the mid-1980s.\n\nWinlaton in the 1980s and 90s:\n\nIn 1985, Winlaton was redeveloped to encompass all youth and child welfare facilities. All statewide youth and child welfare facilities were redeveloped to reduce the role of central institutions. Turana, Winlaton and Malmsbury now operated solely as youth training centres for young people sentenced to detention.\n\nIn 1991, under the Children and Young Persons Act 1989, Winlaton was renamed the Nunawading Youth Residential Centre, and became a facility for 10-14 year old male and female offenders.\n\nLegislation and record keeping:\n\nThe Children and Young Persons Act 1989 required that the provision of services for children and young people on protective orders be separated from those provided to young offenders in custody. The Act established different divisions in the Children's Court to completely separate child protection matters from criminal custodial matters.\n\nThe Children and Young Persons Act 1989 Act also established the term 'children in need of protection', replacing old terms 'ward of state' (from the Neglected Children's Act 1887) and 'trainee' (from the Social Welfare Act 1960). Children and young people involved with child protection and sentenced young people are now all classified as 'clients'.\n\nYoung people who entered the youth justice system before the 1989 Act was implemented, kept their trainee case history files, but not the later Client Relationship Information System institutional files (JJ CRIS prefix). This explains why the older records continued until the late 1990s - well after the terminology had changed.\n\nWinlaton Youth Training Centre was abolished on 17 September 1991, by the Governor in Council under section 249 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1989.\n\nThe term 'client' is still used for all care leavers in Victoria.\n\nAlso see:\n- Nunawading Youth Residential Centre (VA 5214) is the subsequent agency, situated on the same site at 186 Springvale Road, Nunawading.\n- Nunawading Youth Residential Centre, Education Centre No.4794 (VA 3962) represents the education function of Winlaton/Nunawading."

    "description": "The Lutheran Children's Home (also known as Lutheran Peace Memorial Children's Home) officially opened on 22nd October, 1950 at 760 Canterbury Road, Surrey Hills. The Home was established to care for children of widows who migrated to Australia. In 1954 there were 38 children aged from 4 - 14 of 11 nationalities, mainly from Latvian, Estonian, German, Russian, Czechoslovakian, Hungarian and Polish backgrounds.\n\nIn 1952 the Home was registered as a charitable organisation, allowing it to obtain grants or subsidies from the Hospitals and Charities Commission of Victoria. The application was approved on the condition a number of improvements were to be made to the Home. A decision was made to sell the home and buy a larger property at 52 Sackville Street, Kew, which opened on 5th May 1955. The Home was a two storey building with two downstairs dormitories for girls and two dormitories upstairs for boys. At the time of the opening three-quarters of the children were Lutheran; about half of these were children of immigrant parents.\n\nIn May 1956 the Home was gazetted (Gazette No 497) as an approved Children's Home under the Children's Welfare Act 1954. As the number of migrant children decreased, the home gradually began taking in other children needing care, including children who had been made wards of the State. The Home had a total bed accommodation for 42 children between the ages of 4 to 14 (raised to 15 for boys attending school and 15 and above for girls attending school in the mid 1960's).\n\nRenovations were made to the Home in 1967/68 with approximately 32 children in care. By this stage the Home mainly looked after state wards, along with some private placements of children. Holiday Hosts, which were Lutheran families living in the city and country, were approved to take the children to their homes over the school holiday period.\n\nThe Lutheran Teenage Family Care Home officially opened on 28th March, 1971. Located at 755 Station Street Box Hill, the Home accommodated up to eight children who were too old to remain at the Lutheran Home in Kew. The Home allowed for the continued care of teenage children as they grew older enabling them to complete their schooling to eventually find employment or go on to higher education.\n\nIn 1973 the Lutheran Church decided to move to family group home care and proposed the closure of the Kew congregate care home and the acquisition of four or five cottage homes in the Blackburn/Mitcham area.\n\nBy February, 1976 four new cottage homes had been opened in Doncaster East, Mitcham, Nunawading and Blackburn South. Each cottage home cared for five or six children and brothers and sisters were always kept together.\n\nIn 1980 the Teenage Care Home at 755 Station Street, Box Hill was closed and converted to become an administrative and welfare centre for Lutheran Social Services.\n\nIn the 1980s, it was decided to shift the Lutheran Church's resources to the area of Glenelg in south-west Victoria. This resulted in the creation of Glenelg Foster Care in 1983. The reallocation of services took time from 1983, with the last remaining cottage in Melbourne closing in 1988. This allowed children who had already been placed in the Home to remain there until they turned 18. The date of 1983 however has been assigned as the end date of the Lutheran Childrens Home."

At the same time the Home's rostered child care workers were replaced with cottage mothers.\n\nThe Home was closed by the mid 1980s as part of the Department of Community Services (VA 2633) rationalisation of residential child care resources."

It was established to accommodate boys aged from 10 to 15 years, and from 1977 housed mostly older teenage boys requiring longer term accommodation. Boys were often accommodated following a breakdown in home release, foster care or a children's home placement.\n\nThe Victorian Government purchased the large former private home to house boys aged from 10 to 15 years, to address overcrowding at Allambie (VA 5033) and Turana (VA 971) Reception Centres.\n\nIt was proposed by the Social Welfare Branch, Chief Secretary's Department (VA 5099) that Ashendene be used in conjunction with Hillside Boys' Home (VA 5102) in Glen Waverley, with both institutions taking boys with a long history of institutional care. Unlike Hillside, boys at Ashendene were able to attend local schools.\n\nBy 1977, Ashendene's main intake was from Baltara Reception Centre (VA 5090), comprising of older teenage boys requiring longer term accommodation. In 1978 the capacity of the Home was reduced to 24 as the building was considered to be overcrowded.\n\nIn November 1988, boys at Ashendene were relocated to a new facility in Croydon."

The grounds housed a primary school staffed by Education Department teachers.\n\nNumbers varied from 30 to 40, mainly ranging in age from 10 to 16 years, with exceptions as young as six years, or as old as 17 years.\n\nBy 1966 in an effort to relieve congestion at Turana Youth Training Centre (VA 971) and Allambie (VA 5033), the admissions to Hillside were predominantly from these Centres as well as family group homes and almost exclusively boys with complex needs.\n\nHillside was closed in 1984-85."

    "description": "The Boys' and Girls' Receiving Deport (also known as Receiving Depot, Royal Park), established in 1880, was located at 900 Park Street in Parkville. It was the state-run reception centre for children whether they were entering the welfare or justice system. Children ranged in age from 1 day to 17 years.\n\nThe Depot evolved from the government-run Industrial Schools for girls and boys, situated in Royal Park. By 1880, these institutions were referred to as 'Receiving Houses' or 'Receiving Depots'.\n\nThe Depot was a series of cottages with an adjoining farm. It was designed to provide short-term care for up to 60 children. Ideally, infants were to be dispatched to local wet nurses within a day, and older children moved on within one week, but over time the numbers in the Depot grew, with adolescents, children with intellectual disabilities and syphilitic infants forming a core of long-term residents, some of whom stayed on as workers when their wardship came to an end.\n\nThere were two separate institutions at Royal Park - the Boys' Receiving Depot and the Girls' Receiving Depot.\n\nThe Girls' Depot was originally situated in an old powder magazine. Apart from problems with the building's structure itself, the Department sought additional accommodation for 'the girls' moral and sanitary isolation'. In 1887, plans were approved for a new Girls' Depot. The Boys' Depot was to be altered as well, to help make the classification of boys an easier task.\n\nThe new Girls' and Infants' Depot was occupied by 1890. Further changes were made to the buildings at Royal Park in 1892, including the opening of two new separate depots for male and female juvenile offenders. The children were placed in the reformatories at Royal Park before they were transferred to private reformatories.\n\nThe Department reported on further changes at Royal Park in 1898, with the completion of a new building for 'isolation and recreation purposes'. At the turn of the century, the Department raised concerns about the inflammability of the wooden buildings in which older boys were housed. By 1907, plans were being prepared for a brick dormitory for older boys at Royal Park.\n\nIn 1909, after the passage of the Infant Life Protection Act, the Secretary reported a large influx of infants at Royal Park. New facilities for very young children were completed in November 1913.\n\nOvercrowding was nearly always a problem at the Royal Park Depot. The average daily occupancy at Royal Park had risen to 100 by 1910, and had doubled by 1920. During the Depression, with the collapse of boarding-out, the overcrowding at Royal Park intensified, despite arrangements to place some children in non-government orphanages and children's homes.\n\nThe Children's Welfare Department's annual report for the years 1939-1943 stated that the Depot at Royal Park 'functions primarily as a clearing house for wards of the Children's Welfare Department and the Department for Reformatory Schools in their various movements to and from institutions, foster homes and employment.' The Depot was also still being used to hold children on remand from the courts.\n\nThe 1939-43 report stated that: 'To a large extent the Depot is a hospital and much skilled attention and prolonged treatment is frequently necessary, particularly in those cases where the children are suffering from disease and malnutrition as the result of parental neglect, before they can be made acceptable propositions for transfer to private homes or institutions.'\n\nThe Department's annual report for 1951-52 stated that the Receiving Depot at Royal Park was intended to function as an 'observation, classification and treatment centre for new committals prior to transfer elsewhere, and also as a place of remand for the retention of children pending their appearance at Children's Courts'. However, it went on to acknowledge that the Depot has for many children become a permanent residence,' specifically for children with health problems, and 'mentally and physically handicapped children' who couldn't be placed in children's homes, or the institutions run by the Mental Hygiene Department.\n\nFinding placements for female 'delinquents' at Royal Park Depot was a significant issue during the 1950s. In 1952, the Chief Secretary Mr Dodgshun promised that a new security remand depot for girls would be built at Royal Park.\n\nThe annual report for 1954 referred to the Department's difficulty placing 'problem Protestant girls' - the only institution for them being the Elizabeth Fry Retreat in South Yarra. Consequently, the Girls' Remand and Reformatory Sections at Royal Park were experiencing severe overcrowding. The government planned to establish a state-run facility for girls (Winlaton (VA 5093), in Nunawading) to overcome this problem.\n\nIn late 1954, the first experimental cottages were established at Royal Park. A block known as the Hostel was divided into two self-contained flats, in which up to six children lived with a Housemother.\n\nIn 1955, Royal Park changed its name to Turana, an Aboriginal word meaning rainbow. In the year following the name change to Turana, the Royal Park Depot was progressively stripped of its functions with the original buildings used exclusively for adolescent boys. Turana (VA 971) became the main government reception centre until Allambie (VA 5033) was established in 1961."

It was officially opened by His Excellency the Governor of Victoria on 17 December 1963. This was done pursuant to Section 12(a) of the Children's Welfare Act 1958. The building also served as the Department's Regional Office from July 1963. The Centre was renamed 'Miralee' in 1967. 'Miralee' is an Aboriginal word meaning ' black swan'.\n\nIn the beginning, Miralee accommodated approximately 10 to 12 children up to 14 years of age. In 1980 the Department built a new 'Miralee' Reception Centre.\n\nMiralee was one of two non-metropolitan reception centres established after the introduction of the Social Welfare Act in 1960. The Mildura Reception Centre served northern and western Victoria. The other non-metropolitan centre 'Warrawee', located in Ballarat, served central and south western Victoria.\n\nChildren came to the Centre on a Protection Application Order or Safe Custody Order and, if admitted to wardship, assessment of the child was made. The children at Miralee who were made Wards of the state remained at the Centre until suitable arrangements were made for their care. Parents, relatives and friends were encouraged to keep in contact with their children in the Centre and to be involved in the planning for their future care. The children attended local schools and churches.\n\nThe Centre was managed by a professional social worker and staffed by a cottage mother, a relieving cottage mother, a child care worker and domestic staff. Initially, referrals were also accepted from the New South Wales area of the Sunraysia District along the Murray River.\n\nThe Reception Centre was also used as the regional office for the Social Welfare Department. In addition to managing the arrival, and accommodation, of children, the Reception Centre social worker supervised foster care, home release placements in the community and provided assistance with applications for family counselling. A Probation and Parole Officer was also located at the Centre.\n\nDue to a lack of children's homes and family group homes in the Mildura region, some children remained in residence for many months.\n\nIn 1980 the Department built a new 'Miralee' Reception Centre. However, design flaws limited its full effectiveness and the old building was retained to provide accommodation for children unable to be housed in the new building.\n\nMiralee Reception Centre closed in about 1986."

Some children returned to the Centre following a breakdown in subsequent arrangements.\n\nChildren placed at the centre attended local schools and youth clubs while awaiting the outcome of assessments, family interventions, or placement in children's homes.\n\nIn May 1968, it was stated that the Reception Centre was nearly always full. This made it difficult to cope with families of children arriving from time to time without notice from Children's Courts in the surrounding districts. The aim was to separate Regional Office staff from the Centre to allow for more accommodation at the Centre. This occurred in November of that year.\n\nIn August 1968, the Director of Family Welfare wrote that he was very concerned at the lack of activities for the children in the Reception Centre. He stated that a long term plan was needed for the Centre.\n\nIn December 1971 there were 14 children resident at the Centre. In November 1970 there were 17. The number of children discharged to children's homes averaged 69 for the period 1/7/1966-30/6/1969, and 36 for the period 1/7/1969-30/06/1971.\n\nWarrawee Reception Centre was closed 1989."

    "description": "In 1900, Sister E Hartnett founded the Melbourne City Mission Maternity Home.\n\nUntil 1903, it was situated in rented premises in East Brunswick, and then moved to Albion Street, Brunswick, to a building formerly used by the Salvation Army as the Brunswick Girls' Home.\n\nIt functioned as a 'pre-maternity home' for pregnant women and was registered to care for babies. Sister Hartnett arranged the adoption of some of the children in the home's care and supported other mothers to maintain their parenting role. Over time, the home accommodated infants and their mother, including Infant Life Protection infants, and state wards.\n\nIn 1913, a new maternity home was built on the Albion Street site. In 1935, a nursery, kitchen and reading room were added. In 1942, the home accommodated 22 infants, some mothers, and one state ward.\n\nIn 1949, there were eight state wards and 34 infants in residence under the infant life protection provisions. In 1947, a new children's home for residential care was built, adjoining the pre-maternity home, and in 1950 a nursery was added.\n\nFrom 1948-1975, the facility was classified as a category 2 home. For category 1 classification, it was modified to include residential care of children; day kindergarten; family care centre; and a day nursery.\n\nIn 1955, the separate components of the home were amalgamated. It was to be a short-term residential unit but, in practice, was used for long-term placements.\n\nIn 1958, the home was renamed Hartnett House. Circa mid-1960s, the Melbourne City Mission's residential units became approved children's homes.\n\nA report from 1969 indicated that an individual file was kept on each child, containing reception centre material, medical history, copies of correspondence and a very brief general report made by the matron about every six months. The same report stated that adoptions averaged about 100 per year, the babies being born to either girls living in the house or referred by local doctors.\n\nIn 1971-1972 Hartnett House was providing the following services:\n- a 24-bed maternity home for single girls\n;- a counselling and casework service, with a focus on single mothers\n;- an adoption agency (completing an average of 90 adoptions per year)\n;- a 32-bed babies' home\n;- a 25-bed children's home, with children cared for in small groups.\n\nBy 1973, the Melbourne City Mission was renamed the Community Welfare Foundation and had a new board of management, including two departmental representatives.\n\nIn 1972-1973, the numbers of single mothers using the maternity home had declined to a weekly average of only nine, and finalised adoptions were down by 53 from the previous year. In 1973, Hartnett House ceased its maternity home and adoption operations but continued as a children's home.\n\nIn 1974, the department provided additional funding to Hartnett House following the recent closure of the Methodist Babies Home, The Haven, Alexander Toddlers Home and Overton Residential Nursery.\n\nBy the mid-1970s, Hartnett House's children's home was catering almost exclusively for wards and it was reclassified as a category 1 Children's Home. In 1975, Hartnett House established a family centre for vulnerable local families.\n\nIn the late 1970s Hartnett House became a multipurpose organisation focusing on the residential care of children, a registered day kindergarten, the family care centre and a registered day nursery, and also provided family support.\n\nThe Minister for Community Welfare Services, pursuant to Section 29 (1)(b) of the Community Welfare Services Act 1970, declared the residential units operated by Melbourne City Mission as Approved Children's Homes.\n\n\nThe Melbourne City Mission, (VA 5084) which established Hartnett House, was known as Community Welfare Foundation from 1970 to 1979.\n\nBy 1982, Hartnett House was a multiservice agency. It operated a longer-term residential unit for eight children with rostered staff; a short-term/emergency unit for eight children with rostered staff; a family centre providing family support services; and the child development and enrichment centre.\n\nIn 1982 Hartnett House was allocated 'conversion funding' to allow it to stay in long-term care, provided it closed its long-term residential unit and established two family group homes in the north-west region. In 1983, the Melbourne City Mission terminated family support services at Hartnett House.\n\nIn 1984, the Melbourne City Mission converted its medium and long-term residential care of children from a campus program to family group home. During the mid-1990s, the longer-term residential program and the Child and Family Development Unit were phased out. In their place, Melbourne City Mission established additional temporary care units and a long-term youth accommodation unit.\n\nThe Albion Street property is now the Melbourne City Mission's base for its northern region operations.\n\nOther homes established by the Mission included : The Haven of Hope (1926 to 1954), Swinborne Lodge, Pilgrims' Rest Home for Aged Women (1893 to 1927) and Judge Book Memorial Village.\n\n\nNote:\n\nMelbourne City Mission [records] is a collection held at the University of Melbourne Archives. The collection relates to the activities of the Mission since 1856, and includes client records, minutes, annual reports and superintendent file from its institutions for women and children.\n\nSome client records are by the Melbourne City Mission. Records relating to adoptions organised by the Mission were transferred to Adoption and family Records Service, Department of Human Services in 2004."

    "title": "Pleasant Creek (Pleasant Creek Colony 1937-1969; Pleasant Creek Training Centre 1969-1999)",
    "description": "The first building on the site of Pleasant Creek Centre opened in 1861 as a hospital and was known as the Pleasant Creek Hospital. An additional building for convalescent patients named \"Syme Ward\" was built adjacent to the hospital and opened in 1904. These buildings ceased to function as a medical facility for the population of Stawell and district when a newly built hospital opened in the town of Stawell in 1933.\n\nThe Mental Hygiene Department acquired the site and buildings in 1934 with the intention to convert to a Mental Hospital for the aged and infirm. A pressing need, however, regarding accommodation for Intellectually Handicapped Children in the charge of Children's Welfare Department (C.W.D.) resulted in these buildings being converted for this purpose. The first residents (18 boys) were admitted in February, 1937 from the Children's Welfare Department, Royal Park Depot.\n\nThe number of clients residing at the Centre on 31 December 1937 was 98.\n\nOther major building developments were as follows:\n\n \"Lonsdale Unit\" - an ex 2nd W/N R.A.F. relocatable building was opened in 1957 taking the number of residents to 113, as of 31 December 1958\n\n\" Bellfield\" and \"Fyans\" Units - \\*\\*H\" Block designs - were occupied from 1968 and officially opened 21 March 1969, resulting in an increase of resident numbers to 196 as of 31 December 1969. These units continued to accommodate severely to profoundly intellectually and physically disabled clients.\n\nIn 1977 the \"Alexandra\" Unit was converted from a residential to recreational and lecture room facility whilst the Nurses Hostel was taken over for resident accommodation. A Day Centre, Nurses' Home and Clinical Services Administration building were opened in 1977.\n\n In 1985, the Nara Unit, ex Pleasant Creek Hospital, was closed for renovations.\nAccommodation for clients was provided in the ex-staff residence.\n\nAs of October 1986, the number of clients residing at this Centre was approximately 160.\n\nDuring the 1980's, the Centre provided services up to 140 male and female clients, aged between 10 and 45. The level of intellectual disability ranged from profound to mild. The Centre utilised five residential units and four on-site houses to accommodate clients. Service was emphasised upon community repatriation as an outcome. The Centre provided respite care to community clients and used generic services from recreational to medical.\n\nThe most substantial change to the Centre occurred in 1986 when care of the Intellectually Disabled by the Department of Health was relinquished in favour of Community Welfare Services Department. The Intellectually Disabled Persons' Services Act 1986 provided a new legislative framework requiring general service plans and individual service plans for the development of each client. The Centre then abandoned the \"medical model\" in which disabilities were defined as illnesses, and implemented a care model which required each client to be given opportunities to realise his or her full potential. This care model involved a philosophy that the disabled should not be \"warehoused\" in institutions.\n\nIn 1986, Neilson Associates Pty Ltd was commissioned by Community Services Victoria to prepare a report on Intellectual Disability Services. The report was submitted to the Minister in August 1988. One of the principle recommendations was that institutional systems of care and training of the disabled should be dismantled and replaced by smaller facilities. In particular, the report recommended closure of Pleasant Creek Training Centre by 1993 which caused uncertainty for staff working at the Centre. This recommendation was never put into place.\n\nAs of 1990, Pleasant Creek Training Centre provided residence, education and training facilities for 113 Intellectually Disabled people of varying ages from late teens to mid 50's. Occasionally, a younger person was accepted for a short while to receive respite care. At this time, approximately 156 people worked at the Centre.\n\nDuring the 1990's, the Centre continued to provide unit style accommodation to clients with intellectual disabilities. It has played a major role within the Grampians Region in providing long term placements for clients from within the region and from other regions. Respite care services have also been delivered.\n\nOn 7 October 1996, Dr Denis Napthine, Minister for Youth and Community Services, announced the impending closure of Pleasant Creek, in favour of 'community living' options for its residents, who were moved into community accommodation. The facility closed in 1999."

    "description": "The Bayswater Boys' Home was established by the Salvation Army in 1897 at Liverpool Street, The Basin, east of Melbourne. It accommodated boys who had been placed in legal custody, on behalf of the Social Welfare Branch of the Government of Victoria. The campus included three Bayswater Boys' Homes. These Homes closed progressively from 1980. The Bayswater Youth Training Centre closed in 1987.\n\nInitially, there were two Homes in the complex, Bayswater No. 1 and 2 Homes. In 1930, some buildings were transferred from Coode Island and set up as a third home at Bayswater to accommodate boys who had not offended, or who were not suited to the environment of No.1 Home. In 1947, Bayswater No. 3 Home closed and the boys were transferred to a rebuilt and expanded No. 1 Home.\n\nFrom the 1950s, Bayswater No. 1 Home accommodated up to 48 boys on referral from Turana with fixed sentences from the Children's Court. The No. 1 Home always catered for older and more serious offenders in a minimum-security setting. Other homes in the complex dealt with younger people, less serious offenders, non-offenders, and those in need of special supervision and support.\n\nThe No. 1 Home was known as the Bayswater Farm and Vocational Training Centre as farming was its original focus. Training in vocational trades was later introduced. In 1960 it was known as the Bayswater Youth Training Centre and in the mid-1960s it introduced an apprentices' preparatory course.\n\nBayswater No. 2 Home was a separate junior section housing approximately 50 boys. In 1962, a cottage established for 12 boys acted as a halfway house between institutional care and return to the community, increasing No. 2 Home's capacity to 60- 65 boys.\n\nIn 1973, the Salvation Army opened Lyndon Lodge in Auburn as an aftercare hostel for boys from both Bayswater Boys' Home and Hayville Child Care Centre in Box Hill. Administration of the Bayswater Youth Training Centre and No. 2 Home was combined.\n\nBayswater Youth Training Centre ceased operations in 1987. Bayswater Boys Home became the Mountain Valley Youth Camp and Conference Centre, and the youth training centre became The Basin Farm, part of the Salvation Army's Bridge and Employment Programs."

    "description": "In 1973 the Kingsbury Training Centre commenced as a residential institution catering for patients with an intellectual disability, located in the large Mont Park site in Bundoora (along with a number of other institutions).\n\nThe following extract from the Heritage Victoria website explains:\nThe former Mont Park/Bundoora Psychiatric and Repatriation Hospitals Complex consisted of seven hospitals on a site of 185 hectares. The site comprising the Mont Park and Strathallen estates was consolidated by the Victorian government by purchase and transfer from the Closer Settlement Board in 1909. The Mont Park Hospital commenced in 1910 with the building of the Farm Workers Block (later part of Kingsbury Training Centre). In 1912 the landscape gardener Hugh Linaker was employed to layout the grounds of Mont Park and other State mental hospitals. The other hospitals were gradually split off from the Mont Park administration to form separate entities. These were the Macleod Repatriation Hospital (1915), the Bundoora Repatriation Hospital (1920), the Gresswell Sanatorium (1933), Larundel Mental Hospital (1938 opened 1951), the Plenty Mental Hospital (1963) and the Kingsbury Training Centre (1974).\n\nKingsbury was closed by c.1995. The former residents of both Janefield and Kingsbury Training Centres whose support needs were assessed as high, were sent to purpose-built facilities, Plenty Residential Services community residential houses."

    "description": "In 1966, following the foundation of the Cato Chair of Psychiatry at the University of Melbourne, the Parkville Psychiatric Unit was opened under the auspices of the Mental Health Research Institute.\n\nThe purpose of the Unit was to provide inpatient cases for postgraduate psychiatrists in training as it was closely associated with the Department of Psychiatry at Melbourne University. In its first year the Unit had 36 admissions with an average number of 13 residents during the year. A wide range of research was conducted at the Unit.\n\nIn 1970, the Research Institute formerly acknowledged their role at the Parkville Unit by renaming itself the Institute of Mental Health Research and Postgraduate Training.\n\nThe Parkville Unit continually developed. By 1975, facilities included inpatient treatment (36 beds), day patient attendance, outpatient care and individual and group therapy. It continued, however, to provide a facility for teaching of post-graduate doctors and medical students.\n\nDue to its teaching role, patients admitted to the Unit have represented the whole spectrum of psychiatry. Excluded, however, are children and adolescents, demented elderly patients, chronic alcoholics and patients with certain types of drug addictions.\n\nParkville Psychiatric Unit services have since changed. As of 1984, it was a 12 bed psychiatric hospital providing inpatient and outpatient care, especially for adolescents from the North-West zone. In fact, its title was changed to Parkville Adolescent Unit. The Parkville Unit ceased functioning as an inpatient service in 1991."

The site is known as Goornong Public Cemetery.\n\nUnder the provisions of the Cemeteries Acts, trustees of public cemeteries are appointed by the Governor-in-Council, upon recommendation of the Minister for Health.

The Cemeteries and Crematoria Act (2003) requires a cemetery trust to report annually to the Secretary (of Department of Health as at 2014) in respect of the exercise of its powers and functions under the Act. The Trustees were also required to permit free burials of destitute persons (paupers)."

    "description": "Creswick Public Cemetery commenced operations in 1858, with the first burial taking place on 20 December 1858. The cemetery was first mentioned in the Victoria Government Gazette on 7 April 1858, with the official appointment of trustees for the cemetery under the authority of the Governor-in-Council.\n\nThe cemetery was established in Creswick in response to requests for a permanent cemetery site. On 7 November 1856, Alexander Lewers wrote to the Colonial Secretary following a meeting of Creswick residents, asking for advice on how to obtain a permanent cemetery for the township. In the letter, Lewers observes that up until the time of writing, burials were taking place 'on a piece of ground within two hundred yards of the township boundary' and that the ground had 'since proved to be on a lead of gold'. Lewers further observed that the 'crowded state' of the small parcel of land used for burials made it 'dangerous in the highest degree'. This older cemetery, now adjacent to Calembeen Park, had no appointed trustees, was never gazetted, and no records of burials at this location remain extant.\n\nBy March of 1858, trustees had been elected for the new cemetery, and a plan of the subdivision of ground for the new cemetery site had been produced. The new cemetery site of twenty acres was located on the Clunes Road to the north of the Creswick township. An additional triangular area of land adjacent to the cemetery and the Clunes Road was approved in 1868, and the entire area of 'twenty-five acres one rood thirty-three perches' was officially gazette on 12 March 1869.\n\nCemeteries are controlled by a Trust appointed by the Governor-in-Council on the recommendation of the responsible Minister. Trustees are responsible for the administration and maintenance of cemeteries, the collection of fees and expenditure of revenue (for example: grants, subsidies received) the registration of burials and cremations, the making of rules and regulations and determining the scale of fees."

The first burial in the lawn section of the Cemetery was in 1975, and in 1978 the Columbarium Wall was completed.\n\nUnder the provisions of the Cemeteries Acts, trustees of public cemeteries are appointed by the Governor-in-Council, upon recommendation of the responsible Minister (as at 2017 it was the Minister for Health). The Trustees are responsible for the administration and maintenance of the cemetery, the collection of fees, expenditure of revenue (e.g. grants and subsidies received), the registration of burials and cremations, and the making of rules and regulations to determine the scale of fees.

    "description": "The Nunawading Youth Residential Centre was established on 17 September 1991, on the former site of Winlaton Youth Training Centre (VA 5093), as a facility for 10 to 14 year-old male and female offenders. The centre was located at 186 Springvale Road Nunawading.\n\nThe Children and Young Persons Act 1989 required that the provision of services for children and young people on protective orders be separated from those provided to young offenders in custody. The Nunawading Youth Residential Centre functioned as a youth training centre for young people sentenced to detention, and not for children placed on protection orders.\n\nBaltara Youth Reception Centre closed in 1992 and the children were transferred to the Nunawading Youth Residential Centre. A decrease in referrals as a result of diversion programs and community-based sentencing saw the permanent closure of the Nunawading Youth Residential Centre on 3 August 1993. Its residents were sent to the Parkville Youth Residential Centre (VA 5166; see also VA 5086), a new facility built on the site of the former Baltara Reception Centre (VA 5090).\n\nThe Nunawading Youth Residential Centre comprised residential sections within the compound (including Warrina and Karringal), Wimbirra Remand Centre and the Leawarra Hostel. In 1992, Wimbirra closed and the Warrina residential section took over the remand function. The Leawarra Hostel closed in 1992.\n\nIn 1993, the Nunawading Youth Residential Centre had a population of about 25 sentenced youth at the time of its closure. These residents were relocated to Parkville Youth Residential Centre.\n\nLegislation and record keeping:\n\nThe Children and Young Persons Act 1989 required that the provision of services for children and young people on protective orders be separated from those provided to young offenders in custody. The Act established different divisions in the Childrens Court to completely separate child protection matters from criminal custodial matters.\n\nThe Children and Young Persons Act 1989 also replaced the terms ward of state (introduced by the Neglected Childrens Act 1887) and trainee (introduced by the Social Welfare Act 1960), with the new term, children in need of protection. The old terminology was phased out in the 1990s. After this, both child protection cases and sentenced young people were classified as clients, the term used today for all Victorian care leavers.\n\nYoung people who entered into the youth justice system before implementation of the 1989 Act, kept their trainee case history files, and not the later Client Relationship Information System institutional files (JJ CRIS prefix). This explains why the older records continued until the late 1990s, well after the terminology had changed.\n\nThe term client is still used for all care leavers in Victoria.\n\nAlso see:\n- Winlaton Youth Training Centre (VA 5093) is the predecessor agency, situated on the same site at 186 Springvale Road, Nunawading.\n- Nunawading Youth Residential Centre, Education Centre No.4794 (VA 3962) represents the education function of Winlaton/Nunawading."
