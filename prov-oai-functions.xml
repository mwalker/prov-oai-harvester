       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Originally the responsibility of the Statistics Branch within the Colonial Secretary's Office (VA 856), collection of statistics and periodic census-taking became the responsibility of the Registrar-General's Department (VA 2889) in 1854.  Responsibility  was transferred to the Office of the Registrar-General and the Office of Titles (VA 862) in 1873 and then to the newly-formed Office of the Government Statist and Actuary (VA 989) in 1874.  Ministerial responsibility for this agency has been exercised by the Colonial Secretary (VRG 16) to 1855, the Chief Secretary 1855-1869, the Attorney-General (VRG 19) 1869-1874, the Chief Secretary 1874-1979, the Minister for Property and Services (VRG 69) 1979-1983, and the Treasurer (VRG 23) since 1983.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Statistical reports have been published in the Victorian Blue Books and subsequently in the Victorian Year Books.  The census function passed to the Commonwealth (VRG 87) on Federation and since that time many of the Office's statistical activities have also been taken over by the Commonwealth, later Australian Bureau of Statistics.  The Treasurer inherited the Government Statist and Actuary's Office from the Minister of Property and Services in 1983. The position of Government Statist and Actuary has not been filled since the mid-1980s. The Office's remaining actuarial functions are performed on a contract basis by the  sector.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;From 1893 until 1983 the Government Statist's Office was also responsible for the registration of births, deaths and marriages under the Births, Deaths and Marriages Transfer Act 1893 (No.1303).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Port Phillip District was established as part of the Colony of New South Wales in 1836 and Captain William Lonsdale became its Police Magistrate with responsibilities for the District's general superintendence In December 1838, Sub-Collector of Customs Webb also became responsible for the collection of other revenue, including that from land sales, and was appointed Sub-Collector of Internal Revenue and Sub-Treasurer (Historical Records of Victoria, Volume 4, p.69).  The Sub-Treasurer continued to have responsibility for revenue collection and control over expenditure under the Superintendent from 1839 to 1851.  Following separation from New South Wales in 1851 a Colonial Treasurer was appointed, assuming financial superintendence from the New South Wales Colonial Treasurer and local functions from the Superintendent &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;During the years 1851 to 1855 chief executive authority rested with the Governor advised by the Executive Council.  The main departments of government were those of the Colonial Secretary and the principal colonial officials or principal officers of government, including the Treasurer, Auditor-General, Surveyor-General, Collector of Customs (later the Commissioner of Trade and Customs), and Postmaster-General.  The Colonial Secretary was the chief official and all other colonial officials communicated with the Lieutenant-Governor (later Governor) via his office.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Financial Management&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Treasurer has traditionally been responsible for the administration of the State's finances, including economic policy, financial planning, resource management, investment and loan-raising, budget preparation, revenue-raising and collection, and the control and monitoring of government expenditure. Following the appointment of the first Minister for Finance in January 1991 the Treasurer lost control of the control and monitoring of government expenditure and the Comptroller-General.  Similar to the Commonwealth model the government created a finance ministry separate from the Treasurer's portfolio to monitor and control government expenditure and to evaluate the effectiveness of government programs. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;As part of the new portfolio the Effectiveness Review and the Strategic Analysis Units were established to help the budget management and control process. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;This separation of revenue collection from budget allocation was only short lived.  Following the election of a new Government in October 1992, responsibility for the budget oversight functions was returned  to the Treasurer's portfolio in October 1992. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Significant machinery of government changes impacted on the administration of this function in January 1991, January 1992 and October 1992.  Responsibility for aspects  of the finance function moved back and forth three times from Property and Services to Finance ,thence  to Treasury and then back to Finance.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The following functions were transferred from the Treasurer's portfolio:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt; government expenditure - monitoring and control of (back to the Treasurer in October 1992); &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt; Comptroller-General's division - management of the government's bank account .The (the Accounting Audit and Policy Unit was not transferred until January 1992).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Following the 1996 election the administration of the portfolios of Treasury and Finance was again amalgamated . into the Department of Treasury and Finance.&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background

Locally appointed Immigration Agents operated within the Superintendent's Office (VA 473) from 1839 to 1851, the Colonial Secretary's Office (VA 856) from 1851 to 1855 and the Ports and Harbours Branch of the Department of Trade and Customs (VA 606) from 1855 to 1900.

From 1839 to 1868 local officials worked in conjunction with the British Government's Emigration Officer in London who was responsible for promoting migration, supervising the selection of applicants for both Government and privately-sponsored schemes, and arranging for their passage.  In 1868 an Agent-General for Victoria was appointed in London to take over these responsibilities in relation to migration to the Colony of Victoria.

Early Government-funded assisted immigration schemes, which developed in response to a demand for immigrant labour for the rapidly growing Port Phillip District, used the proceeds from the sale of crown land and involved paying a bounty to settlers who sponsored immigrants and provided employment.  Large numbers of assisted immigrants arrived from Britain during the period 1839 to 1841 and 1847 to 1851.  A financial depression in the 1840's resulted in virtual suspension of assisted immigration from 1841 to 1847.  During this time the British Government sent out some ships with exiles. Although technically Victoria did not accept convicts the "exiles" left as rehabilitated prisoners who, upon arrival, were given a pardon on condition that they did not return to Britain for the unexpired term of their sentence.

During the Gold Rush period, 1851 to 1861, most immigrants paid their own way and Government and privately sponsored schemes were largely eclipsed by this unassisted immigration.

The Victorian Immigration Statute 1864 (27 Vic., No.195) consolidated earlier legislation, including the Act 27 Vic., No.175 (1863), which established the office of Agent-General, introduced Government and ly-sponsored nomination schemes, provided for the employment of Immigration Committees to assist new arrivals and made special provision for control and regulation of alien (non-British or foreign) immigration.

Separate legislation, also administered by Trade and Customs officers, applied to Chinese immigrants who were required to pay an impost on entry and a yearly impost thereafter, which included their Miner's Right - see Statutes 18 Vic., No.39 (1854), 21 Vic., No.41 (1857) and 22 Vic., No.80 (1859).

By 1873 as a result of the deteriorating economic situation, the government began to withdraw financial support for assisted immigration and by 1883 such immigration ceased altogether.  The Government-sponsored nomination scheme for immigrants with special skills was also phased out. Extensive unassisted immigration from British and foreign ports continued. (It is unclear whether a nomination scheme continued for unassisted immigrants and further research is required in this area.) 

Shortly after Federation, the Commonwealth (VRG 87) assumed primary responsibility for the control and regulation of non-British immigration (both assisted and unassisted), unassisted British immigration, naturalisation and associated reception, settlement, employment and welfare services.</description>

       <description type="full">Background

The first police force in Victoria comprised the constabulary attached to the Police Magistrates, the first District Constable being appointed in September 1836 (New South Wales Government Gazette 14 September 1836).  From 1837 to 1853, in addition to the local District and Rural Constabulary, there were a number of separate police forces, including the Melbourne City Police, Border Police, Mounted Police, Water Police, Native Police, Gold Escort and Goldfields Police.

District Constabulary and Melbourne City Police

On 9 September 1836 the Governor of New South Wales proclaimed the official settlement of the Port Phillip District and Captain William Lonsdale was appointed Police Magistrate of the District on 14 September (see VRG 7).  As well as taking responsibility for the general superintendence of the District, he also undertook the duties of a New South Wales District Police Magistrate, including administration of justice and supervision of the local constabulary.  Following the appointment of a Superintendent of the District in 1839, the duties of the Police Magistrate were restricted to responsibility for the local constabulary and local magisterial functions in Melbourne and the position was retitled Police Magistrate, Melbourne.  In the meantime Police Magistrates were being appointed in other localities, Captain Foster Fyans taking up duty in Geelong in late 1837 (see New South Wales Government Gazette, 13 September 1837, on appointment of constables).  The Police Magistrates continued to be responsible for the constabulary within their Districts until 1853 when responsibility for all police matters was vested in the Chief Commissioner of Police (VA 724). 
 
In Melbourne and Geelong Districts, quite large police forces existed by 1853, the Melbourne City Police including a Detective Force (established in 1844).  By 1850 constables assigned to rural areas outside Police Magistrates' Districts were referred to as the Rural Bench Constabulary.  In 1850 the Chief Constable of the Melbourne and County of Bourke Constabulary was titled Superintendent.

A number of New South Wales Acts regulated police in the Port Phillip District, including the Act which regulated police activities in towns and was extended by proclamation in November 1838 to cover Melbourne as well as Sydney (see the New South Wales Acts 2 Vic., No.2, 11 Vic., No.44, 14 Vic., No.38).  The Melbourne Corporation Act of 1842 (New South Wales Act 6 Vic., No.7) included special provisions for the Melbourne City Police.

The constabulary's responsibilities included law enforcement, arrest of offenders, gaol keeping, patrol and escort duties, the serving of summons and execution of warrants.  The Melbourne force also had a criminal detection role.

Other Police Forces 1837 - 1853

From 1838 a number of separate special purpose police forces were established including the:

   	Border Police (from 1838)
   	Mounted Police (from 1838)
   	Water Police (from 1841)
   	Native Police (established 1842 after several earlier unsuccessful attempts)
   	Gold Escort Police (from 1851)
   	Goldfields Police (from 1852).

The Border Police were attached to Commissioners of Crown Lands and assisted in the regulation of the use and occupation of Crown lands (see also VRG 27 District Lands Offices).  Detachments of Mounted Police were drawn from infantry regiments stationed in New South Wales.  They were posted on overland routes and attached to Police Magistrates' Districts to assist in general police duties.  They also served with the Gold Escort and Goldfields forces attached to the Goldfields Commissioners (see also VRG 25 Mining Districts).  As well as escorting gold being transported to Melbourne and maintaining law and order on the diggings, these forces policed the use of miners' rights.  The Water Police assisted the Harbour Master to enforce ports and harbours regulations, regulate and control shipping and seamen.  The Native Police Corps was set up to maintain order between aborigines and settlers.

Development 1836 - 1853

Administrative responsibility for the police establishment prior to 1853 rested with the Police Magistrate 1836-1839 (VRG 7), Superintendent 1839-1851 (VRG 11) and Colonial Secretary (VRG 16).  By 1842 when police strength outside Melbourne numbered 135, including all independent forces and the local District constabulary, police stations had been established at Geelong, Williamstown, Portland, Hamilton, Port Fairy, the Goulburn and Broken Rivers, the Grampians and the Pyrenees.  By 1847 there were also stations at Sale, Horsham, Mt. Macedon, Pearson's Station and Colac, by 1850 at Kilmore, and by 1851 at Dandenong and Bacchus Marsh.

The Gold Rush precipitated a crisis for Victoria's police forces with many men deserting to join the Rush in a time of increased demands for their services.

A Legislative Council Select Committee on Police reported in 1852 that the existing police forces were "insufficient in numerical strength - deficient in organisation and arrangement - and utterly inadequate to meet the present requirements of the country."  It recommended their replacement with a single unified force and the division of the colony into a number of uniformly administered police districts (see Report from the Select Committee on Police to the Legislative Council 1852, Votes and Proceedings 1852-3, Volume 2).

Formation and Operation of the Victoria Police Force From 1853

Following the recommendations of the Select Committee, a single integrated Victoria Police Force (VA 724) was formed by the Police Regulation Act 1853 (16 Victoria 24) and placed under the control of a Chief Commissioner of Police.  The existing forces, with the exception of the Water Police and the Detective Force, which continued to function within the Victoria Police Force, were disbanded, but many of their members were absorbed into the new Force.  From 1853 a Victoria Police Gazette has been published weekly and in 1856 the first Manual of Police Regulations was issued.

In regard to its general law enforcement and policing duties the Victoria Police has operated since 1853 on a District basis with the Colony, and later the State, divided into a number of metropolitan and country Districts with further sub-divisions down to local police station and police office level.  These regional arrangements have gone through a number of restructures.  Initially there were 9 police Districts, but these were increased to 11 following the 1881 Royal Commission.  By 1971 there were 19 Districts, 7 metropolitan and 12 country, further divided into Divisions, then Sub-Districts.  Recent restructures have resulted in the formation of large Regional Offices.  District boundaries are detailed in the Gazettes.
The position of Chief Commissioner was also established by the 1853 Police Regulation Act.  The Office of the Chief Commissioner provides central control, supervision, administration and coordination for the Victoria Police Force, its members and its operations.  The Chief Commissioner has been responsible to the Colonial Secretary 1853-1855 (VRG 16), the Chief Secretary 1855-1979 (VRG 26) and most recently the Minister for Police and Emergency Services (VRG 73).  Administrative assistance has been provided to the Force by Victoria Police and Public Service officers.  Prior to the establishment of the Ministry for Police and Emergency Services (VA 421), the public servants belonged to the Police Branch or Police Department of the Chief Secretary's Department (VA 475).  They now belong to an Administration section within the Office of the Chief Commissioner.  Currently (1989) the Chief Commissioner's central police administration is divided into the following sections, each headed by an Assistant Commissioner - Crime, Operations, Traffic, Services, Personnel, and Research and Development.  In addition to these regional and central management structures, a number of specialist areas have developed within the Force.

Criminal Investigation

Criminal detection or investigation was from the beginning the responsibility of the Detective Force which was reorganised into the Criminal Investigation Branch (CIB) following the 1881 Royal Commission.  The Special Branch was formed within the CIB in 1931 with close links to the then Commonwealth Security Service (later Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation - ASIO), while in 1953 an Information Section/Bureau and in 1936 a Fingerprint Branch/Bureau were added.  Until 1936 the CIB operated from the Melbourne District, but thereafter it was decentralised into 8 Metropolitan Divisions.  In 1948 it was further regionalised into 24 Metropolitan and 15 Country CIB Divisions.  Other specialised sections and squads were added to it over the years - the Victorian Police Scientific Section and Detective Training School in 1938, the Homicide Squad in 1943, and more recently the Company Fraud Squad, Armed Robbery Squad, Arson Squad and so on.

Other Specialist Sections

Other special purpose units have also emerged, including the Licensing and Gaming Squads, Public Relations Office (1946), the Forensic Science Laboratory (established in 1955), the Police Surgeon (1947), the Motor Boating Squad (1964), the Dog Squad, Police Air Wing and Community Policing Squad.  D24 was established in 1939 as the Force's Communication Control Centre.

Role in Times of Emergency

During the World Wars, the Force took on extra functions under wartime emergency legislation.  In 1939-1945 D24 became a vital civil defence communications and air raid warnings centre with close ties to the military police organisations.  Police also controlled lighthouses and the Special Branch took on responsibilities for enforcing national security regulations.  After World War II the police continued to be responsible for coordinating emergency services in an emergency until this role was assumed directly by the Minister for Police and Emergency Services following the 1982 Ash Wednesday bushfires.  D24 continues to provide the State coordinating centre in an emergency.

Royal Commissions and Inquiries

A series of inquiries and Royal Commissions have been held into police administration and operations (see also VRG 14 Royal Commissions and Boards of Inquiry).  These have included a Commission of Inquiry appointed after the Eureka incident in 1854, a Parliamentary Select Committee in 1862, a Royal Commission following the Kelly Outbreak in 1881, further Royal Commissions in 1906, 1923 (following the Police Strike) and 1936, the Abortion Inquiry in 1970 and the Beach Inquiry in 1975 (see the bibliography "Victoria Police Reading and Study Guide" in Police Life, November-December 1982, for a listing of published reports).  The recommendations of these inquiries and Commissions - and of Colonel Sir Eric St. Johnston in his 1971 Report - resulted in various organisational changes, restructuring, reforms and innovations, for example formal training for recruits was introduced following the 1906 Royal Commission;  significant pension reforms after 1923;  a major restructure, establishment of the Internal Investigations Unit, and an opening up of career opportunities for women after the St. Johnston Report in 1971.

Women in the Victoria Police

Women first joined the Victoria Police Force in 1917 when two women were appointed as "agents" - they received half the pay of policemen and did not have the constable's power of arrest.  In 1924 the four women police agents were reappointed with full constabulary powers, the same wages, hours and pension rights as policemen.  By 1942 there were 12 policewomen and by 1950 18.  Their work tended to be restricted to law enforcement in areas such as neglected children, control of prostitution and abortion.  In 1950 the first woma... truncated</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Early History to 1851&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Port Phillip had been surveyed and charted, basic ports and harbour facilities installed, and the first bay pilot licensed between 1836 and 1839.  Under Superintendent La Trobe a Harbour Master, C.M. Lewis, was appointed, more permanent navigation aids installed (the first lights being built at Point Gellibrand in 1840 and Queenscliff between 1841 and 1843), wharf facilities improved and additional pilots appointed.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Role of Department of Trade and Customs 1851 to 1900&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;From the beginning of the Department of Trade and Customs (VA 606) in 1851 a number of functions were consistently grouped together administratively and this grouping subsequently became identified as the Ports and Harbours Branch of the Department.  The Ports and Harbours Branch was responsible for:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;   	control of vessel movements into and out of Victorian ports&lt;BR /&gt;   	regulation of loading and discharging of goods including the collection of wharfage rates&lt;BR /&gt;   	provision of pilot services&lt;BR /&gt;   	construction and maintenance of Government marine vessels&lt;BR /&gt;   	maintenance of navigational aids and operation of lighthouses, lightships and signal stations&lt;BR /&gt;   	provision of emergency services along the Victorian coast&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1877 responsibility for ports and harbours functions within the Port of Melbourne was assumed by the newly-established Melbourne Harbour Trust Commissioners (VA 2799).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Prior to 1900 the Public Works Department exercised some responsibility for harbour and river improvements, including the development of dock accommodation and pier construction, and also for dredging operations not within the jurisdiction of the Melbourne Harbour Trust Commissioners (VA 2799).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;It is evident that dredging operations were undertaken at coastal ports and harbours as well as on inland waterways.  By 1910 the section of the Public Works Department responsible for dredging and snagging operations had been incorporated into the Ports and Harbours Division.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Transfer to Public Works Department 1900&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1900, prior to the abolition of Department of Trade and Customs and the transfer of its key functions of the Commonwealth, the Ports and Harbours Branch of that Department was transferred to the Public Works Department.  The key functions associated with the Ports and Harbours Branch at this time were:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;   	regulation of shipping and provision of pilots at Victorian ports other than the Port of Melbourne&lt;BR /&gt;   	maintenance of buoys and beacons and other navigational aids not within the Port of Melbourne&lt;BR /&gt;	provision of lighthouses and lightships&lt;BR /&gt;   	provision of emergency services along the Victorian coast&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;By 1902 marine surveying was also part of the Ports and Harbours functions.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Responsibility for Lighthouses and Navigational Aids Split 1915&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;On its establishment in 1901 the Commonwealth was authorised to make laws with respect to lighthouses, lightships, beacons and buoys. The federal Lighthouses Act 1911 gave the Commonwealth power to enter into an agreement with the Governor of any State for the acquisition of lighthouses and marine marks, and to erect or alter such navigational aids as required. On 1 July 1915 the Commonwealth took over responsibility for the lighting of the coastal shipping tracks between the various ports (ie. highway lighting used by ships proceeding from one port to another). The States retained control over the lights and navigational aids established in ports, harbours and rivers (ie. for the use of vessels entering or leaving ports).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Port of Melbourne&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Establishment of Melbourne Harbour Trust&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Melbourne Harbour Trust Act 40 Vict., No.5523 (1876) which became effective on 1 January 1877, provided for the establishment of a statutory body to be known as the Melbourne Harbour Trust Commissioners.  The Act provided for the appointment of fifteen Commissioners representing various interests in the Port. The first election and appointment of Commissioners occurred on 30 March 1877, followed by a meeting on 11 April 1877 at which office bearers were elected.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The long title of the establishing Act states as its purpose,&lt;BR /&gt;	"to provide for the Regulation, Management and Improvement of the Port of Melbourne and certain portions of the River Yarra Yarra and certain portions of the Saltwater River...."&lt;BR /&gt;and thus identifies the key responsibilities vested in the Melbourne Harbour Trust  Commissioners, which in more specific terms included the following major functions:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Regulation of the trade of the port with respect to such matters as&lt;BR /&gt;landing and shipping of merchandise&lt;BR /&gt;arrivals and departures of vessels&lt;BR /&gt;wharfage rates&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Management of port facilities such as wharves, piers, jetties, docks, ships, lights, buoys, beacons, moorings, tugs, workshops, water police, emergency services, and land adjacent to the port's waterways&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Improvements to the port including&lt;BR /&gt;widening and deepening the port's waterways&lt;BR /&gt;construction and maintenance of wharfage accommodation, docks and other port facilities as mentioned above&lt;BR /&gt;regular dredging operations&lt;BR /&gt;control of noxious trades and deposits of refuse within the port boundary&lt;BR /&gt;co-ordination of the above functions to ensure the efficient operation of all port activities.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Prior to the establishment of the Trust there had been no co-ordinated management and development of the Port of Melbourne.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;On 14 November 1883 two additional Commissioners were appointed under provisions of the Melbourne Harbour Trust Act Further Amendment Act 47 Vic., No.763 1883.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Until 1900 the Melbourne Harbour Trust Commissioners was responsible to the Commissioner of Trade and Customs (VRG 22) and thereafter to the Minister for Public Works (VRG 28).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;A major reconstitution of the Melbourne Harbour Trust Commissioners occurred in 1913.  Under the Melbourne Harbour Trust Act 1913 (No.2449) the body of seventeen elected Commissioners was replaced by five Commissioners appointed by the Governor-in-Council.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The five Commissioners included a full-time Chairman and four representatives of the following : owners of ships, exporters, importers and primary producers.  The first meeting of the new body occurred on 4 February 1913.  Under the provisions of the Melbourne Harbour Trust Act 1913 , responsibility for the railway piers at Port Melbourne and Williamstown were also vested in the Commissioners with effect from 1 December 1913.  This brought all wharves, piers and jetties within the Port of Melbourne under the authority.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Establishment of Port of Melbourne Authority&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Under the Port of Melbourne Authority Act 1978 the Melbourne Harbour Trust Commissioners was reconstituted as the Port of Melbourne Authority (VA 1426), with effect from 8 November 1978. The reconstitution did not reflect a change in functions, but rather represented an attempt to follow modern practice with respect to the naming of organisations responsible for the operation of ports throughout the world. the Port of Melbourne Authority has been registered as a separate agency (see VA 1426).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Port of Melbourne (World Trade Centre) Act 1978 (No.9221), which came into operation on 19 December 1978, vested the Port of Melbourne Authority with authority to construct, maintain and operate a World Trade Centre in the Port of Melbourne.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Development after 1978&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;A statutory body, the Port of Melbourne Authority was responsible to the Minister of Public Works (VRG 28) until 1 July 1983 when overall responsibility for maritime activities, including the functions of the Authority, was transferred to the Minister of Transport (VRG 49).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;On 1 October 1986 the Ports and Harbours Division of the Ministry of Transport was integrated with Victoria's three port Authorities.  Hence the Port of Melbourne Authority assumed responsibility for the administration and operation of all ports in eastern Victoria including : Port of Western Port, Port of Anderson's Inlet, Port of Corner Inlet and Port Albert, Port of Gippsland Lakes, Port of Snowy River, and Port of Mallacoota.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In addition, responsibility was assumed for various port and marine related services, including:&lt;BR /&gt;the maintenance and upgrading of navigational aids in all Victorian coastal waters&lt;BR /&gt;oil pollution control in all Victorian coastal waters&lt;BR /&gt;hydrographic surveying of Victorian ports and coastline&lt;BR /&gt;beach renourishment, and the maintenance of recreational boating facilities provided by the Government, along Victoria's eastern coast.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Responsibility for port facilities and activities along Victoria's western coast were divided  between the Port of Portland Authority (VA 1427) and the Port of Geelong Authority (VA 1425).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Developments during the 1990s&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Under the Port Services Act 1995  the Port of Melbourne Authority was divided into three sections.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;	 - Victorian Channels Authority responsible for the environment, for the movement of shipping including harbour control, dredging and the provision of navigation aids.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;	 - Melbourne Port Corporation established as a State Government Business 1996 functioning as the landlord of the Port of Melbourne being responsible for the strategic planning of the port and the operation of common user facilities.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;	 - Melbourne Port Services, privatised and sold in 1996 to Skilled Engineering Ltd. As Skilled Maritime Services.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Eastern Victorian ports are managed separately and the Hastings Port (Holding) Corporation (VA 4264) was established by the Port Services (Amendment) Act 1997 to carry out certain functions in relation to the Port of Hastings.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Port of Geelong&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1905 responsibility for port and marine services at the Port of Geelong was transferred to the newly established Geelong Harbour Trust.  The Geelong Harbour Trust was reconstituted as the Port of Geelong Authority under the Port of Geelong Authority Act 1981 (No.9658). The PGA was responsible for the management and regulation of activities at the port at Geelong and within Corio Bay and the outer harbour of Geelong. In addition, the Authority was responsible for the associated ports at Queenscliff, Barwon Heads, Lorne and Apollo Bay.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Port of Geelong Authority was abolished on 10 Dec. 1997.  The commercial functions of the PGA were transferred to TNT Ports Ltd on 1 July 1996.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Residual functions were transferred to other agencies including the Department of Natural Resources &amp; Environment (DNRE), the City of Greater Geelong (CGG), Victorian Channels Authority (VCA), and Parks Victoria (PV).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Office of the Administrator assumed responsibility for the administration of the residual rights and obligations of the corporate structure of the Port of Geelong Authority.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Warrnambool and Portland&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Responsibility for management of the Warrnambool harbour, including the control of shipping and port facilities and the general preservation and improvement of the port, was assumed by the Warrnambool Harbour Board (VA 2836) upon its establishment in 1928.  When the Board was abolished in 1936 responsibility was formally resumed by the Ports and Harbours Branch.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1951 a Portland Harbour Trust was established assuming responsibility from the Ports and Harbours Branch for the management and control, general preservation and improvement of the Port of Portland.  The Portland Harbour Trust was reconstituted as the Port of Portland Authority on 13 January 1982 under the Port of Portland Authority Act 198... truncated</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Public Works prior to Separation from New South Wales&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The first public works were undertaken by convict labourers, overseen by the military detachment responsible for guarding them.  The first Clerk of Works was appointed in mid-1837.  Plans for the settlement's early permanent buildings, including the Customs House, Survey Office, Post Office, Police Office and official residences were prepared by the Colonial Architect in Sydney, but the Clerk of Works took detailed direction in overseeing the works from Lonsdale.  Other early buildings included a barracks, hospital, schoolhouse and prison.  (See also Historical Records of Victoria, Volume 4).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Following the appointment of the Superintendent, Port Phillip District in 1839, public works continued to be overseen by locally appointed officers under La Trobe's direction. The Melbourne Gaol in Russell Street was completed in 1844.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In May 1846, Henry Ginn was appointed Clerk of Works and by 1850, the civil establishment for public works included the Clerk of Works, Superintendent of Bridges, six overseers and clerks, a clerk and a messenger.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Public Works following Separation&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The period between separation from New South Wales in 1851 and the achievement of responsible government in 1855 was characterised by a huge expansion in revenue, population, the size of the colonial administration and the need for public works and buildings.  During this period the structure of the administration of public works was re-organised a number of times.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;From 1 July 1851, the Colonial Secretary was the chief official and all other colonial officials communicated with the Lieutenant-Governor (later Governor) via the Colonial Secretary's office.  Following separation the former Clerk of Works, Henry Ginn, was appointed Colonial Architect. The Returns of Public Works for 1851 and the Civil Establishment (see VPRS 943, Blue Books, Vol.1) suggest that the Colonial Architect was responsible for the construction, maintenance, rental and furnishing of public buildings.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The appropriations for 1852 suggest that the Colonial Engineer and the Superintendent of Bridges were together responsible for public works.  The Colonial Architect continued to be responsible for the construction, rental and furnishing of public buildings. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;By 1854 there had been an amalgamation of the functions and staff of the Colonial Engineer and the Colonial Architect.  The position of Colonial Architect no longer existed and the chief architect was clearly subordinate to the Colonial Engineer.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Select Committee of the Legislative Council on Public Works 1853/4&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Some of the administrative difficulties which may have prompted the Government to establish the Board of Land and Works (VA 744) in 1857, were described in the "Report from the Select Committee of the Legislative Council on Public Works" in 1853/4 (Papers Presented in Parliament 1853/4 Vol.3).  The Select Committee had noted "the want of co-operation between different departments;  the loose mode of authorizing expenditure;  the unsatisfactory manner of dealing with tenders and the delays in payments, all of which cause unnecessary waste of the Public Funds and enhance the cost of Public Works....".&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;When giving evidence on these matters, Henry Ginn, the former Colonial Architect, in response to a question seeking his views on the best mode of carrying on public works, replied "... I am most clear that it should be by a Board composed of those professional men who would afterwards have the carrying out of the works fixed upon.  The Board should consist of the Surveyor General, the Colonial Engineer and the Colonial Architect.  Thus when the Surveyor General was about to lay out a new township, he would have the advantage of consulting the Colonial Engineer on the subject of roads, bridges etc. and with the Colonial Architect as to the necessary buildings and the most convenient site for them".  Henry Ginn also recommended that the Board should be empowered to decide upon tenders;  to consider the plans for proposed public works and buildings and to determine their location;  and that once the work had been completed, the Board should inspect it and determine whether the design specifications had been met.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Government opted instead for the appointment of a Commissioner of Public Works who was to be responsible for the co-ordination of all public works from 1855.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Establishment of the Board of Land and Works &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Board of Land and Works was established by statute in 1857 (An Act to establish a Board of Land and Works, (No.31) because it was considered that the administration of public lands and public works would be more effectually and economically managed if they were consolidated and placed under one head.  Under the provisions of the "Act to establish a Board of Land and Works", all powers previously vested in the Commissioner of Public Works and the Surveyor General were to be vested in the Board and Letters Patent dated 28 April 1857 formally abolished the two positions of Commissioner of Public Works and Surveyor General or Commissioner of Crown Lands and Survey.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Departments of the Civil Service which were then under the respective control of those two positions effectively became sub-departments.  While there was clearly an intent to achieve consolidation, the extent to which the sub-departments were administratively integrated following the establishment of the Board in 1857 is uncertain and from late 1858 by which time a Commissioner of Public Works and a Commissioner of Crown Lands and Survey had been reappointed, the sub-departments are clearly administratively separate.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1865 "An Act to Amend and Consolidate the Laws Relating to Public Works" (No.289) (referred to as the Public Works Statute) was passed.  The duties of the Board, as set out in section 12, were to  "... consider and determine all matters and questions relating to the adoption of any plans and specifications for public works and shall consider and deal with all requisitions for buildings, furniture, or repairs and shall decide upon the acceptance of all tenders for such works, buildings, furniture or repairs and the terms and conditions on which the same shall be accepted ... and all other matters and questions relating to or concerning the public lands, works and buildings of the colony."  Although statutory responsibility for these functions was vested in the Board, operational responsibility was effectively exercised by various sub-departments of the Board including the Public Works Department (VA 669) and a number of these sub-departments became Departments of State on the abolition of the Board in 1964.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Under the provisions of the Public Lands and Works Act 1964 (No.7228) the Commissioner of Public Works became the Minister of Public Works in whom were vested the relevant statutory powers of the Board of Land and Works.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Role of Public Works Department&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;No research has yet been undertaken into the role of the Public Works Department in the construction and supervision of public buildings and the way in which the Department exercised its responsibility for public works.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;It is clear that the civil establishment of the Department always included a very significant number of architects, engineers, draftsmen and inspectors who together were responsible for the design and construction of public buildings, the preparation of plans and specifications and the supervision and inspection of all public works and buildings under construction.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;It is also apparent that most of this work was undertaken by  contractors but the role and responsibility of the Department in the letting and supervision of contracts is yet to be researched.  Until 1964, statutory responsibility for the design, construction and maintenance of public buildings, the approval of plans and specifications, the consideration of tenders, the supervision of contracts and the approval of requisitions for buildings, furniture and repairs was vested in the Board of Land and Works (VA 744).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Transfer of Public Buildings and Related Functions from the Public Works Portfolio&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1987 a Minister for Housing and Construction was appointed and assumed responsibility for the planning, design and construction of public buildings and the restoration and maintenance of existing buildings for the Government and agencies funded from the State budget.  &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Department of Planning and Housing was established in January 1991 and inherited responsibility for the general planning function.  The "public building" function which had previously been the responsibility of the Ministry of Housing and Construction (VA 2907) was also transferred at this time: design and construction of government buildings.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Following significant machinery of government changes after the October 1992 election, the Department of Planning and Development was established by Administrative Arrangements Order No.114.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Department inherited responsibility for all the functions of the short-lived Department of Planning and Housing (VA 3013) (planning, environment effects statements, heritage protection, building regulation, housing and design and construction of government buildings).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Following significant machinery of government changes after the re-election of the Kennett Government in April 1996 the Department of Planning and Development was abolished. Under Administrative Arrangements Order No.150 all functions of the Department, except the Office of Housing, were transferred on 3 April 1996 to the Department of Infrastructure.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Office of Major Projects&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Office of Major Projects is responsible for major projects assigned to it by the Government.  The modus operandi of the Unit is for the Government to formally assign responsibility for specified approved projects to the Unit.  Any liabilities arising from Government approved activities are the responsibility of the State.  The Minister responsible formally assigns responsibility in accordance with the Premier's order of 13 February 1987 and Section 4 (1) (c) of the Urban Land Authority Act (No.9320).  Initially there were eight projects managed by the Unit, all of them important to the development of inner Melbourne.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The functions of the Office include acquisition, consolidation and preparation of sites.  Its task is to facilitate the development of large strategically significant areas of government-owned land for commercial, tourist and residential purposes.  It is responsible for major state projects assigned to it by the Government.  It provides a central contact point for  developers interested in investing in major government projects.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Office has the authority to invite tenders, evaluate competitive development proposals, select developers, facilitate planning approvals, execute financial and legal agreements and supervise construction.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Some of the projects managed by the Office have been:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;   	World Congress Centre&lt;BR /&gt;   	Redevelopment of the State Library&lt;BR /&gt;	Victorian Archives Building&lt;BR /&gt;   	Museum&lt;BR /&gt;   	Old Treasury&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Prior to the establishment of the Central Roads Board (VA 2803) in 1853, the construction of roads and bridges had been the responsibility of the Clerk of Works until 1844 when the Superintendent of Bridges was appointed.  The Superintendent apparently exercised joint responsibility with the Colonial Engineer from the latter's appointment in 1852.  From separation in 1851, these colonial officials were responsible to the Colonial Secretary.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Establishment and Functions&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1853, the Central Roads Board was established under the provisions of An Act for making and improving Roads in the Colony of Victoria (16 Vic., No.40).  The Board consisting of three members appointed by the Lieutenant Governor, was to be responsible for the formation, construction, improvement, management and maintenance of proclaimed main roads and bridges and for the co-ordination of the works undertaken by the District Roads Boards.  The Act provided for the appointment of a Secretary and Treasurer to the Board and for the appointment of an Inspector General of Roads and a staff of engineers, surveyors, clerks and other officers who were responsible to the Board.  The Board was also responsible for the calling of tenders, determination of the position of toll gates, appointment of toll keepers, levying of tolls which were payable at any punt or ferry constructed at public expense at a rate which was determined by the Lieutenant Governor and for prosecutions for the non payment of tolls.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Municipal Responsibility&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In rural areas the earliest local government authorities were concerned with roads.  The New South Wales Parish Roads Act 1840 provided for the establishment of elective Road Trusts to maintain and repair roads in their areas.  The first trust was Warringal (Heidelberg) in 1841.  Under the provisions of Act 16 Vic.,No.40, District Road Boards were established and given responsibility for the construction and maintenance of roads and bridges other than those proclaimed as main roads.  In the exercise of their powers District Road Boards were expected to comply with the requirements of any general plan established by the Central Roads Board for the development of the colony's roads and bridges and the Chairmen of the District Road Boards were entitled to attend the meetings of the Central Roads Board in an ex-officio capacity having the right to be heard but not to vote.  District Road Boards also had the power to levy rates and tolls.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Municipal Institutions Act 1854 provided for the establishment of Municipal Districts which were responsible for the construction and maintenance of local roads and bridges.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Formation of Department of Roads and Bridges 1858&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Under the provisions of the Board of Land and Works Act 1857 21 Vic., No.31 the Central Roads Board (VA 2803) was disbanded on 1 January 1858 and the Board of Land and Works (VA 744) took over responsibility for main road construction and bridges.  Local authorities continued to be responsible for local roads and bridges (see VRG 12 Municipalities).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Operational responsibility for main roads and bridges was exercised by the newly formed Department of Roads and Bridges which operated as a sub-department of the Board of Land and Works. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Administrative Structure and Functions&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Office Branch&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;This Branch was headed by a non-political Commissioner of Roads and Bridges who was a member of the Board of Land and Works and who had responsibility for the general management and control of the Department.  The Commissioner would obtain information from district engineers and the public concerning the expediency of constructing particular roads or bridges and would prepare a scheme and estimates to be submitted to Cabinet.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Engineering Branch&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;This Branch was headed by the Inspector-General of Roads who was responsible for determining the character of works to be executed, and for the execution by contract of all such construction and maintenance works.  This officer had control over district Road Engineers who in conjunction with surveyors from the Department of Crown Lands and Survey (VA 538) would prepare plans and designs, take levels and mark out lines of roads.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;NOTE:	The relationship between local government and the administration of roads and bridges needs  to be clarified.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Role of Board of Lands and Works&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Board of Land and Works (VA 744), vested with statutory responsibility for roads and bridges, accepted the contracts, approved and authorized the business and expenditure of the Department, and decided matters of difficulty and all matters of policy.  The Board also assumed responsibility for regulating the collection of tolls.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Ministerial Responsibility&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Prior to the establishment of the Board of Land and Works (VA 744), the Commissioner of Public Works was the Minister responsible for roads and bridges functions.  Upon establishment, the President of the Board of Land and Works assumed responsibility for all powers previously vested in both the Commissioner of Public Works (VRG 28) and the Surveyor General (or Commissioner of Crown Lands and Survey - see VRG 18).  It is apparent however that roads and bridges matters continued to be associated with Public Works functions until the Department of Roads and Bridges emerged in its own right in 1858 (see also VA 669).  Between late 1858 and late 1861 the Commissioner of Crown Lands and Survey appears to have been the Minister responsible for roads and bridges.  In December 1861 a Commissioner of Railways and Roads was appointed assuming responsibility for roads and bridges functions.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Merging of Roads and Railways Administration 1871&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Despite there being a single Minister responsible for both railways and roads from 1861 it is evident that the Department of Railways (VA 2877) and the Department of Roads and Bridges existed quite independently, with separate administration, until 1871.  On 26 April 1871 John Steavenson, who was the Assistant Commissioner of Roads and Bridges, was also appointed to the position of Secretary to the Railways Department and thereafter the two departments appear to have been jointly administered as the Department of Railways and Roads (VA 2875).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;From the Department of Roads and Bridges (VA 2964) the new Department assumed responsibility for the construction and maintenance of main roads and bridges.  Local roads continued to be the responsibility of road districts, shires and boroughs.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Under the Local Government Act 1863 , road districts and shires were given recognition as being the mediums of local government with the delineation of their rights, powers, modes of proceedings and responsibilities.  Roads and bridges, including main roads, within the municipality were to become the responsibility of the district or shire.  District boards were to construct and maintain main roads following the issuing of an Order-in-Council and if a plan had been deposited with and approved by the Board of Land and Works.  If the  proper completion of the work was able to be certified, a payment would be made to the district from that portion of the consolidated revenue known as the Main Road Construction Fund.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Split of Railways and Roads Functions&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;On 1 September 1877 the Governor-in-Council severed the administration of matters relating to roads and bridges from the Department of Railways and Roads.  Railways matters were subsequently assumed by a new Department of Railways II (VA 2965) and roads and bridges matters passed to a Roads and Bridges Branch operating within the Public Works Department (VA 669).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Research is yet to be undertaken into the role of the Roads and Bridges, later the Roads, Bridges and Harbour Works section of the Public Works Department in the construction and maintenance of roads and bridges from the abolition of the Department of Railways and Roads in 1877 until the establishment of the Country Roads Board (VRG 722) in 1913.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;By 1884 the civil establishment for this function within the Professional Division of the Department included an engineer "specially engaged in the preparation of designs, plans and specifications of the new Falls and Princes Bridges";  an engineer, two inspectors, an overseer and three foremen of road labourers who together were responsible for the supervision and inspection of roads, bridges and reclamation works executed by the Government;  the preparation of plans and specifications and the supervision of plans and specifications furnished by local bodies for subsidized works.  Within the Administrative Division there were three clerical officers responsible for the conduct of business relating to roads and bridges, so far as it pertained to the work of the Department and for correspondence relating to municipal work in connection with the administration of the Local Government Act.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1894 the establishment for the Administrative Division was unchanged and the Professional Division consisted of two engineers, an inspector and a draughtsman who were located within a section for Roads, Bridges and Harbour Works.  By 1904 there was no longer a separate section within the Administrative Division and the Professional establishment consisted of two engineers (one position being vacant) and two draftsmen who continued to be responsible for the supervision and inspection of Government roads and other works, the preparation of plans and specifications and the supervision of local bodies' plans.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Given the very few staff employed, it is presumed that the actual construction work must have been undertaken by  contractors but the role of the Department in co-ordinating and managing this work has not yet been researched.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The appropriations for this period include allocations for the construction and maintenance of roads and bridges outside the boundaries of the municipalities.  By 1889-90 these funds had been reduced to 750 pounds which was allocated for the completion of existing contracts.  Allocations for non-municipal roads then ceased for a period during the 1890's when the appropriations for public works generally were drastically reduced.  By 1897-8, the appropriations included sums for the making, clearing and draining of roads to Village Settlements and by 1903-4 substantial sums were again being provided for road works and bridges, drainage and other works subject to the approval of the Governor-in-Council.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Throughout the period small sums were also allocated to local municipal authorities to assist in the construction and maintenance of roads and bridges.  Although these allocations were also significantly less during the 1890's, at no time did appropriations for this purpose cease.  Although the constitution of municipal authorities has been amended a number of times, the construction and maintenance of local roads and bridges has continued to be a municipal responsibility (see VRG 12 Municipalities).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Establishment of the Country Roads Board 1913&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;By 1910 it had become increasingly apparent that there was a need for a central roads authority to take over responsibility from the Board of Land and Works (VA 744) for the care and management of the main roads of the state.  Up to this time there had been a lack of co-operation between the agencies with operational responsibility for roads, i.e. the Roads and Bridges Branch of the Public Works Department and local municipalities, in the construction and maintenance of main roads.  Expenditure of State funds was without proper supervision and there was no thorough investigation of actual needs.  The absence of a systematic policy, as... truncated</description>

Education prior to 1848

Schools in the Port Phillip District were not subject to direct Government administration until 1848 when the Government of New South Wales established the Denominational School Board (VA 703) and the Board of National Education (VA 920).  Prior to that time financial assistance either in the form of masters' stipends or a subsidy in proportion to local contributions was granted to schools established by recognized religious denominations and some assistance was given to parents who could not afford to pay the school fees.

In 1844 a Select Committee of the Legislative Council was appointed "to enquire and report upon the state of education in the Colony and to devise the means of placing the education of youth upon a basis suited to the wants and wishes of the community".

The Committee was critical of the denominational system which it considered to be excessively costly and reported that it considered the present state of education in the Colony to be extremely deficient and that many children were receiving no education at all.  The Committee recommended that one uniform system of education be established.

Although the Legislative Council endorsed the report by a slim majority, Governor Gipps did not sanction the necessary appropriations to implement the Committee's recommendations since he believed that without the co-operation of the Ministers of religion who were opposed to the recommendations it would not be possible to establish a useful general system of education.

By 1847 however, the church authorities were prepared to accept the establishment of dual boards and systems in return for increased state aid.  On 4 January 1848, a General Education Board was formed for the regulation  and inspection of schools to be conducted under Lord Stanley's System ie. the Irish National System which had been established by Lord Stanley in his capacity as Chief Secretary for Ireland.  This system provided for the non-sectarian education of children at locally administered schools which were responsible to a national board.

Board of National Education (N.S.W.) (VA 920) 1848

The Board of National Education was established under the provisions of An Act to incorporate the Board of Commissioners for National Education.  (II Vic.,No.48 in 1848) which authorised the Board to acquire and hold lands and buildings.  George William Reesden was appointed as Southern Agent for the Board.  Under the General Instructions for the Agents in Establishing National Schools dated 23 June 1849, agents were required to encourage the establishment of new schools chiefly in those localities where education had not previously been available and were not expected to advocate the establishment of National Schools in areas where denominational schools were already in existence.  The Agents were required to arrange public meetings, to provide copies of the Board's regulations, to explain the features of the National system and to assist with the selection of local patrons.  They were also required to provide the Board with descriptions of proposed school sites which in settled districts were to be not less than two acres and elsewhere not less than ten acres;  to report on the suitability of the proposed local patrons;  to provide statistical information regarding prospective students and to provide information on the practicability of establishing industrial schools and associated boarding homes for children.  The Board considered that thirty children was the minimum number of students to justify the granting of aid for the establishment of a school.

The Commissioners were prepared to grant aid towards the building and support of elementary schools and a limited number of industrial schools on the condition that at least one third of school building costs was subscribed by local residents.  Under the Board's regulations of May 1848, applications for aid were to include the names of not less than three local patrons who were to be responsible to the Board.  If a Crown grant of land was unobtainable, applications were to include a description of the proposed school site and the nature of its title;  a conveyance of the fee simple (or lease where specifically agreed upon) was to be made to the Board of Commissioners.  Upon approval of the application a plan and specification together with an estimate of expenditure was to be supplied by the local patrons.

The Commissioners were prepared to contribute part of the cost of establishing the school house and to provide school books and equipment.  The Board was responsible for the appointment of teachers but was prepared to consider recommendations from local patrons.

Local patrons were responsible for the provision and maintenance of school buildings and equipment, the setting and expenditure of school fees, the inspection of school records and for monitoring and reporting on the conduct of teachers in the discharge of their duties.  They were required to report annually to the Board.

To the extent that it applied to the Colony of Victoria, the 1848 Act establishing the Board of National Education was repealed with the passing of Act to incorporate the Board of Commissioners for National Education 15 Vic., No.7, 1851, following Victoria's separation from New South Wales.

Denominational School Board (VA 703) 1848-1862

The Denominational School Board was appointed in January 1848 "for the temporal regulation and inspection of the respective Denominational schools of the Colony within the district of Port Phillip" and was directed "to draw up a code of regulations for the conduct and inspection of schools of the different denominations, the appointment and remuneration of school masters,... the system and extent of degree of education to be taught in the schools and the terms on which the children of paupers will be admitted - in fact all that relates to the fiscal and temporal part of education." (Colonial Secretary to Denominational School Board, 4 January 1848.  Archives Office New South Wales).

The Board was responsible for the distribution of funds to denominational schools from an annual Parliamentary grant and a proportion of the Church and Schools Estates Revenue.  On 11 February 1848 a Denominational School Board for the Port Phillip District was appointed.  For a short period, following separation and prior to the establishment of the Board of National Education for the Colony of Victoria (also known as the National School Board) on 30 December 1851, the Denominational School Board was appointed to conduct business relating to National Schools.

On 8 July 1851 a Select Committee was appointed "to enquire into and report upon the present systems of instruction of youth in this Colony, receiving support from the public revenue.....and to recommend, if found requisite, a plan of education better adapted to the wants of the Community."  (See Votes and Proceedings of the Legislative Council, Session 1852-3).  The Select Committee, whilst acknowledging the differences of opinion within the community and noting that the Denominational and the Irish  National System were each supported by a large section of the community, declined to recommend that the separate systems be continued in their present form.  They noted the problems caused by the rivalry and hostility between the promoters of each of the two systems and the unnecessary costs involved in supporting a dual administration.  Given the conflict of opinion, they considered that a mere amalgamation of the Boards was not feasible and recommended instead a scheme based on a plan of the Committee of Privy Council on Education be implemented.

The Committee advocated that the only requirements necessary to obtain support for a school be its efficiency in imparting sound literary and moral education and the absence of any rules requiring compulsory religious instruction.  They recommended that all schools receiving assistance be known as public schools and that a single Board consisting of four laymen be appointed with responsibility for the administration of all matters connected with public instruction and the sole management of the funds allocated.

The recommendations of the Select Committee were not implemented, debate on the issue ensued for a further ten years and Victoria continued to have a dual system of publicly funded schools.

Establishment of the National School Board 1852-1862 (VA 919)

The Board of National Education for the Colony of Victoria, commonly known as the National School Board (VA 919) was established in 1852 under the provisions of An Act to incorporate the Board of Commissioners for National Education 15 Vic.,No.7. It took over the role previously carried out by the New South Wales Board of Education and was responsible for the oversight of schools outside the ambit of the Denominational School Board.  The members of the Board were appointed by the Governor with the advice of the Executive Council and the Board was responsible for the distribution of funds to schools, the management and government of schools, the appointment of teachers and the inspection and maintenance of schools.

Establishment of the Board of Education (VA 713) 1862

The Board of Education was established in 1862 under the provisions of An Act for the better Maintenance and Establishment of Common Schools in Victoria 25 Vic.,No.149.  This Act repealed An Act to incorporate the Board of Commissioners for National Education which had established the National School Board (VA 919) and all property previously vested in that Board was vested in the Board of Education.  The Denominational School Board was dissolved, land and school buildings were to continue to be vested in the trustees who were also empowered to transfer them to the Board of Education or sell them and apply the proceeds to educational purposes.  The personal property of the Denominational School Board was to be vested in the Board of Education.

The Governor-in-Council was empowered to appoint five laymen as Commissioners provided that no two members of the Board were to belong to the same religious denomination.  The Board was responsible for the distribution of funds, for determining where schools should be established, the inspection of schools, the examination and classification of teachers, the determination of a course of secular study to be adopted in schools and the setting of school fees.  The Board was also responsible for the appointment of staff and for ensuring that funds allocated were properly used.

The Act provided for the appointment of an Inspector-General;  established a minimum number of pupils for the granting of aid;  regulated the establishment of new schools;  provided for a minimum of four hours secular instruction each day, prohibited exclusion of pupils or grounds of religious persuasion and provided for the education of destitute children.  The Act also provided for the appointment of local committees which were to be responsible to the Board.


Education Act 1872 and establishment of the Education Department (VA 714)

Victoria was the first of the colonies to introduce free, compulsory and secular education with the passing of the Education Act 1872 (No.447).  School attendance increased by approximately fifty percent as soon as education became free and compulsory.

The Education Act was born out of dissatisfaction with the form and content of education as well as the controversy over religion and education.  The Higginbotham Royal Commission in September, 1866 recommended, inter alia, that a Minister of Public Instruction, responsible to Parliament, have a general superintendence over education in Victoria.  Higginbotham introduced a Bill, based on his suggestions, to Parliament in May, 1867 but it received only a luk... truncated</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Mechanics Institutes &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The first libraries in Victoria were Mechanics Institutes. Mechanics Institutes began in England in the early 1800s in an attempt to raise educational standards. They were the first Adult Education schools usually consisting of a library, lecture room and a hall. The word mechanic meant Artisan or Craftsman. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Melbourne Mechanics Institute, founded in 1839, provided a library that displayed every leading journal from Britain and the Australian colonies. Gradually mechanics institutes and other subscription libraries were established in most suburbs and country towns. Although they were not free public lending libraries until 1856, the rapidly increasing population and the thirst for knowledge was so great that the Institutes and other subscription libraries did well for some years.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The establishment of the Melbourne Public Library in 1856&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;From 1852 Redmond Barry, the first chancellor of the University of Melbourne, began lobbying for the establishment of what was then unknown in the Australian colonies: a well-organised and well-stocked free library open to general readers.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Legislative Council of 1853 agreed with him and granted a two acre site bounded by Swanston, LaTrobe, Russell and Little Lonsdale streets for the first free government public library. Barry became chairman of a board of five trustees. Augustus Tulk an Englishman who had arrived in Melbourne in 1854 was appointed the first Chief Librarian. He was appointed just in time to help unpack crates of nearly 4,000 new volumes that had just arrived from England.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The embryonic library was opened, after two years of construction work, by the Administrator of Victoria, Major-General Sir Edward Macarthur, in February 1856.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Nearly 24,000 visitors used the library during 1856. This increased to 50,000 in 1857;  78,000 in 1858;  and 128,000 in 1859: more than the numbers that frequented the British Museum in London.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Administration of the Library (1856  1944)&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;From the period of its establishment in 1856 through to 1944, the library was administered by a Board of Trustees who were responsible for managing and controlling the Public Library. The Trustees were a body corporate with an official seal, capable of acquiring, holding and disposing of property, and of doing anything that a body corporate may by law do. The Trustees also acted as a supervisor of money and other property. In performing its functions the Board of Trustees represented the Crown. The Trustees were subject to the general direction and control of the Victorian Chief Secretarys Department (VA 475) and were appointed by the Governor in Council on the recommendation of the Minister.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;From the period 1863 to 1869 the Melbourne Public Library along with the Museum of Natural History and the Museum of Art, was administered by the Trustees of the Melbourne Public Library and the Fine Arts Commission. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Under the provisions of the Library Museums and National Gallery Act 1869, the Melbourne Public Library became the Public Library of Victoria and was incorporated with the National Gallery and Museum. The Trustees subsequently were to have the management and control of the Public Library, the National Museum of Victoria (VA 431), the National Gallery of Victoria (VA 930) and the Industrial and Technological Museum (VA 1411). This arrangement lasted until 1944.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Travelling Libraries (1869  1920)&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;From the beginning the Library was financed by the Colonial Government, and the early trustees attempted to serve the whole of Victoria, not just the city area. Thus, in 1859 Victoria became a pioneer in the use of travelling libraries, whereby cases of books were sent to mechanics institutes and other centres on extended loans. This service was confined to institutions within ten miles of Melbourne until 1867 when this limit was abolished. In 1892 a separate lending library was opened for metropolitan residents and extended to country areas in 1920. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Administrative changes&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In the 1920s professional organisations of librarians and later, persons such as the late Sir John Latham, Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, began a campaign against deficiencies in the library services, and the Munn-Pitt Report in 1935 created enough interest for action to be taken. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1940 the Library Service Board was established and following its report in 1944 the State Library underwent some administrative changes. Under the provisions of the Public Library National Gallery and Museums Act, the Public Library was separated from its affiliated bodies and became subject to the management and control of the Trustees of the Public Library of Victoria. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;By the 1940s less than 15% of Victorias population was served by free public libraries. The lack of library services within both metropolitan and regional districts of Victoria prompted the gradual establishment of municipal libraries. As a consequence State Library created the Library Training School in 1948.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;State Library National Gallery National Museum and Institute of Applied Science Act 1960&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Established in 1960 by the State Library National Gallery National Museum and Institute of Applied Science Act, the State Library (VA 2923) assumed responsibility for all functions previously undertaken by the Public Library of Victoria (VA 913) became the State Library of Victoria.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The establishment of the Library Council of Victoria 1965&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1963 the Governor in Council appointed Sir John Jungwirth to sit as a Board of Inquiry to assess the library situation in Victoria and to make recommendations for future development. The subsequent report, published in 1964, stressed the need for cooperation and coordination to develop library services in Victoria. Accordingly the Library Council of Victoria Act 1965 created the Library Council of Victoria to carry out the functions of the State Library Trustees. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Council was to consist of a president and eight members appointed by the Governor in Council. The Act provided that of the eight other members, six should meet certain qualifications. One should be a person distinguished in the field of education;  one should represent municipalities within the Melbourne metropolitan area defined under the Act;  another, the municipalities outside the metropolitan area;  and one of the members should be a professional librarian appointed from a panel of names submitted by the Victorian Branch of the Library Association of Australia.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The principal functions of the Council regarding the State Library were to: &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;manage and control the State Library;  &lt;BR /&gt;maintain and develop the State collection of library material&lt;BR /&gt;make library material within the State collection available to users as freely as possible, consistent with considerations of preservation; &lt;BR /&gt;carry out and make available such other services in relation to library matters and library material as the council sees fit; &lt;BR /&gt;publish and reproduce for sale material from the State Collection; &lt;BR /&gt;encourage library cooperation and coordination within and outside Victoria; &lt;BR /&gt;manage and control the Library Training School; &lt;BR /&gt;manage and control the preservation of public records.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The La Trobe Library, 1965&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Under the legal deposit provisions of the Copyright Act of 1869 and subsequent legislation, one copy of all works published in the State must be deposited in the Library. This collection of books, newspapers, maps, pictures and objects of historical interest, together with other Australiana and material on New Guinea, the South Pacific, New Zealand, and the Antarctic, was housed in a special wing called the La Trobe Library which was opened in 1965.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Separation of the Public Record Office from the State Library in 1972&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The responsibility originally vested in the Council to manage and control the preservation of public &lt;BR /&gt;records passed to the Public Record Office following the passage of the Public Records Act 1972.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Closure of the Lending Branch of the State Library&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Lending Branch of the State Library, established in 1892, was closed in 1971 because of the increasing numbers of municipal libraries being established around Victoria. However, persons not living in areas served by a municipal library were still able to borrow. To supplement the services of municipal libraries, the Library Council established a Municipal Support Service that began operating in March 1971.This service made available the stock of the State Library to persons throughout Victoria through local municipal libraries.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;At the same time, the Library Training School was being phased out in 1971 when courses became available elsewhere.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Administrative restructuring&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Under the provisions of the Ministry for the Arts Act 1972, the State Library became administered by Victorias first Ministry for the Arts. The Ministry was established in an effort to advise and cooperate with other bodies concerned with the promotion and practice of the arts in Victoria.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Libraries Act 1988&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;As part of a government initiative to bring greater efficiency to the library network by providing a more focussed approach to the development of library policies the Libraries Act 1988 established the Council of the State Library of Victoria. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Council of the State Library of Victoria was established to be responsible for the development and operational matters of the State Library of Victoria including the custodianship of the State collection of library material ensuring that it was managed, preserved, accommodated, maintained and developed in an efficient and economic manner.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The functions of the Council were to:&lt;BR /&gt;ensure maintenance, preservation and development of the State Collection, with special attention to the collection of material relating to Victoria and its people; &lt;BR /&gt;make sure that the collection is available to users as freely as possible, consistent with considerations of preservation; &lt;BR /&gt;provide all necessary services and facilities to enhance the effectiveness of the Library; &lt;BR /&gt;publish and reproduce for sale material from the State Collection; &lt;BR /&gt;exhibit material from the collection for information, education and entertainment.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Libraries (Amendment) Act 1992 added a further function:&lt;BR /&gt;manage the land and buildings on the Swanston Street site currently occupied by the Library and Museum of Victoria.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Arts Institutions (Amendment) Act  1996 &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In February 1997 the Victorian Government proclaimed the sections of the Arts Institutions (Amendment) Act 1996 that created the Library Board of Victoria, which replaced the former Libraries Board of Victoria and Council of the State Library of Victoria. The new Board was to combine the state-wide policy role of the Libraries Board with the State Library governance responsibility of the Council. The new act conferred greater responsibility and accountability on the Board, while also providing opportunities for the Library to play a more vital leadership role in the state-wide network of libraries and information providers.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Board was subject to the direction and control of the Minister for the Arts.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The functions of the Board in relation to the State Library were to:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;ensure the maintenance, preservation and development of a State collection of library material including a comprehensive collection of library material relating to a Victoria and the people of Victoria; &lt;BR /&gt;ensure tha... truncated</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Dr Ferdinand Mueller (later Baron Ferdinand von Mueller) was appointed as Victoria's first Government Botanist in 1853 with a brief to study the native flora of the colony, particularly its potential for commercial and medicinal application. [Annual Report Royal Botanic Gardens Melbourne, 1993, p.5] As Government Botanist Mueller was also responsible for preparing botany and economic botany exhibits for the Melbourne exhibition of 1854 and the Paris exhibition of 1855. In the same year as his appointment he established a national herbarium.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1857 a new office was created and Mueller was also made Director of the Botanic Gardens (later Royal). He established close relations with similar institutions throughout the world and effected important exchanges of plants, re-arranged and extended the grounds and paid particular attention to the native vegetation. He also devoted part of the area to plant-beds showing a scientific arrangement of plants in their natural orders.  &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The National Herbarium, which houses a collection of dried plants, systematically named and arranged for research purposes and for the identification of plant specimens submitted by the community, was managed by the Government Botanist until 1982. The original herbarium was built in 1857 to accommodate the botanical collections of the Government Botanist and to house his  collection formed from 1840 which was later presented to the State.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1873 the positions of Director of the Gardens and Government Botanist were divided and Mueller was deprived of the former office. In 1924 the offices of Director and Government Botanist were again united and the National Herbarium of Victoria was again brought into association with the Gardens, having been separated since Mueller's removal from the directorship in 1873. From 1924 the Royal Botanic Gardens and the National Herbarium have been administered jointly and in 1992 after 146 years of being part of the administration of various government departments, management of the National Herbarium and the gardens passed to the newly established Royal Botanic Gardens Board (VA 3124) in July 1992 under the provisions of the Royal Botanic Gardens Act 1991.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Governor Gipps having approved the establishment of a "public domain for the purpose of rearing and cultivating indigenous and exotic plants", William Londsdale, the Police Magistrate, in 1841 ordered Robert Hoddle, then surveyor-in-charge, to mark out a block of 50 acres on Batman's Hill and the adjoining riverbank. Nothing came of this order, but several other sites were suggested and in 1845 [Superintendent] La Trobe chose the slopes of a gully leading down to the Yarra River near the grounds of Government House. Here John Arthur, [appointed in 1846 as the first Curator of the gardens], fenced a 5-acre paddock and laid it out in flower-beds and plantations. Both he (1846-49) and John Dallachy (1849-57) paid attention to the introduction of exotic plants and permitted the gardens to be used for horticultural shows.(Australian Encyclopaedia, Vol.II, pp.57-58).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1857 Ferdinand Mueller, who had been Government Botanist since January 1853, was appointed to the new office of Director of the Gardens. He established close relations with similar institutions throughout the world and effected important exchanges of plants, re-arranged and extended the grounds and paid particular attention to the native vegetation. He also devoted part of the area to plant-beds showing a scientific arrangement of plants in their natural orders and established a national herbarium. (Australian Encyclopaedia, Vol.II, pp.57-58).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;"Mueller's view of a botanic garden was as a scientific and educational institution and his development of the garden reflected this conviction" (Annual Report Royal Botanic Gardens Melbourne, 1993, p.5)&lt;BR /&gt;In 1873 the positions of Director of the Gardens and Government Botanist were divided and Mueller was deprived of the former office. The directorship passed to William Robert Guilfoyle, who during his long term (1873-1909) extended the gardens by over 30 acres and increased the number of species represented. The deepening and straightening of the course of the Yarra allowed an extension of the garden area, taking in the old river-channel and adding it to the existing lake. (Australian Encyclopaedia, Vol.II, pp.57-58).&lt;BR /&gt;With his radically different concept of a botanic garden as a place to provide inspiring views and to display plants artistically and influenced by English landscape design, Guilfoyle totally redesigned the Botanic Gardens." (Annual Report Royal Botanic Gardens Melbourne, 1993, p.5) &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1924 the offices of Director and Government Botanist were again united and the National Herbarium of Victoria was again brought into association with the Gardens, having been separated since Mueller's removal from the directorship in 1873.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Cranbourne Botanic Garden was initiated in 1970 with the purchase of land by the Government for the purpose of establishing a native botanic garden. Cranbourne was opened to the public in 1991.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;After 146 years of being part of the administration of various government departments, management of the gardens passed to the newly established Royal Botanic Gardens Board (VA 3124) in July 1992 under the provisions of the Royal Botanic Gardens Act 1991.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Prior to the proclamation of the Cemeteries Statute 1864, the administration of cemeteries had been governed by an 1850 New South Wales Act, 14 Vic., No.19, An Act for the establishment and regulation by Trustees of a General Cemetery near the City of Melbourne and by the provisions of An Act for the Establishment and Management of Cemeteries in the Colony of Victoria 17 Vic., No.12 (1854).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Under the provisions of the Cemeteries Acts trustees of public cemeteries were to be appointed by the Governor-in-Council.  The Trustees were responsible for the establishment and management of public cemeteries, the collection of fees, expenditure of government subsidies including fencing grants and the making of rules and regulations for the administration of cemeteries. They were required to keep accounts of receipts and expenditure including grants from the consolidated revenue and to forward an annual abstract to the Chief Secretary for publication in the Government Gazette.  Trustees were also empowered to make rules and regulations for the management and maintenance of cemeteries and to determine a scale of fees, subject to the approval of the Governor-in-Council and publication in the Government Gazette.  They were required to permit the free burial of destitute persons.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;By 1864 and until August 1873, the Commissioner of Public Works (VRG 28) and the Public Works Department (VA 669) were responsible for the administration of cemeteries including the appointment of trustees and approval of regulations and fees.  From 1873 until 1888 the Commissioner of Crown Lands and Survey (VRG 18) and the Department of Crown Lands and Survey (VA 538) were responsible and in 1888 the Chief Secretary (VRG 26) and the Chief Secretary's Department (VA 475) assumed responsibility.  The Public Works Department (VA 669), however, continued to be responsible for the allocation of fencing grants.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1890, under the provisions of the Public Health Act 1889 (No.1044), the Minister of Health (VRG 39) and the Department of Public Health (VA 2904) became responsible for the management of cemeteries and responsibility has remained within the health portfolio.  In 1944, with the proclamation of the Ministry of Health Act 1943 (No.1988), there was a major reorganisation of the administration of health functions.  Responsibility for all health services was transferred to the Minister of Health and a Department of Health (VA 695) was established.  The Minister of Health became immediately responsible for the administration of the Cemeteries Acts&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Since 1890 responsibility for cemeteries has remained with the Minister and departments responsible for health.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Cemetery Records&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;From 1867 under the provisions of the Public Health Amendment Act 1867 (No.310) trustees were required to maintain a Register of Burials.  There are however very few records of individual cemeteries in the custody of the Public Record Office.  See VRG 5 Cemeteries and List of Holdings 2nd edition 1985, section 3.11.7 (Warringal Cemetery).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;A form of land tax was first imposed in Victoria in 1877, with the object of breaking up large holdings. The Land Tax Act 1877 (41 Vic., No.575) introduced land tax payable by owners of "landed estates". The Act provided for the appointment of Commissioners of Land Tax to oversee the classification (valuation) of land and to hear appeals against such classifications. The Act also provided for the appointment of a Registrar of Land Tax.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Victorian Land Tax Act 1910 (No.2284) introduced a tax levied on the unimproved value of land. This Act removed the land tax levied under the existing Land Tax Act as from 27 August 1910.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Federal Land Tax Act 1910 gave the Commonwealth Government power to levy a tax upon the unimproved capital value of all lands in Australia not specifically exempted, with the intention of breaking up large estates. Federal land tax was abolished in 1952.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;As at 2001 land tax is levied annually on the unimproved value of all land owned by a taxpayer where the value of the land exceeds a specified value. Most public bodies and charities are exempt and concessions are available for certain pensioners and veterans.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The tax is collected by the State Revenue Office established under Administrative Arrangements Order No.106 effective from 28 April 1992. The Order effectively merged the Stamp Duties Office and State Taxation Office which were operating independently within the Department of the Treasury The Order also created the position of Commissioner of State Revenue to replace the positions of Commissioner of Taxation, Comptroller of Stamps, Commissioner of Pay-roll Tax, Commissioner of Land Tax, Commissioner of Probate Duties and Commissioner of Business Franchises&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background

The first "active" firewood and timber reserves were set aside in February 1862 in the vicinity of the goldfields. In October 1865 a report was presented to the Government on "The Advisableness of Establishing State Forests". The first legislative base for state forests was proclaimed in 1865 when, under section 41 of the 1865 Land Act reserves could be proclaimed for the "protection and growth of timber" (usually called timber reserves).  From 1866 State Forests began to be set aside under section 5 (the normal reserve clause) of the Act, "the distinction made on the grounds that timber reserves could be used by miners and settlers until the supply was exhausted at which time the land was then alienated, while state forests could only be used by approved, licensed timber-millers and fellers". [from R. Wright The Bureaucrats' Domain. Space and the Public Interest in Victoria 1836-84, Oxford University Press, Melbourne 1989, p.155.]

The Land Act 1869 contained a schedule of land reserved for timber production but these gazetted reserves were of a temporary nature and revocable at short notice. Various attempts were made from 1870 onwards to legislate for proper management and conservation of the reserves but the situation deteriorated. The Government engaged two foresters from India, Vincent in 1887 and Ribbentrop in 1869, to investigate the causes of the poor condition to which the forests had been reduced and to recommend measures for improvement. A Royal Commission "to investigate the general question of forestry and forest control and management in Victoria" was constituted in 1897. Its final report, presented in 1901, resulted in the first effective forest legislation in the form of the Forests Act 1907.

The final report of the Royal Commission describes the pre 1907 forestry situation in Victoria:
	"For many years timber in the forests throughout the colony was cut under a system of annual licences, by which millers and other timber-getters, on payment of small fee, were able to cut without restriction as to quantity, kind, or size. The licensee of a sheep or cattle run, the purchaser of any public land, the holder of a carrier's licence l or of a miner's right, had for a considerable period the privilege of taking without payment, "for their own use," without restriction, timber of any kind growing on the public domain.  The only licence to professed timber-getters was a general one, which cost them 1 10s. a quarter.  Subsequently an alteration was made, which continued in force up to the end of 1871, and which enabled persons to cut timber without restriction as to age, size, or quantity, under an annual licence for the sum of 5.  This fee, being apparently considered too high, was afterwards reduced to 2.  In 1869 a new Land Act was passed by the Legislature, and in the following year regulations were made to meet the requirements of sawmillers, which provided for granting them mill sites, exclusive rights over cutting areas, and tramway routes, on condition of payment of royalty on the material cut.  In 1871 another general alteration of mill regulations took place, and still further alterations in 1873, but the brief period of control on a royalty basis ended with the restoration of the former vicious system of indiscriminate licensing at fixed rates per quarter.  Certain checks on cutting were imposed, especially in the case of the cheaper licences for splitters, &amp;c., but in most cases they could not be enforced either from being impracticable, or owing to the lack of a protective staff....  

	"For several years previous to 1888 there had been an Inspector of Forests, who was also in charge of the State Nursery at Macedon, but in that year the Government in power decided to appoint an officer to manage the reserves, with the designation of Conservator.....When he assumed control in 1888, one of his first acts was to provide for additional supervision, a number of foresters, some with and some without training, being appointed.  He also strove, but without success, to get the Government of the day to pass through Parliament a Bill which had been prepared to secure better control and protection of the reserves.  His subsequent efforts in the same direction had the same result.

	"With the exception of period of several years, when the Minister of Agriculture (usually in those days Minister of Lands also) had control, and in 1892-3, when the administration was transferred to the Mines Department, the forests of the colony have been administered and controlled by the Lands Department.  To this circumstance is unquestionably due a great deal of the failure which has hitherto attended all efforts to secure rational conservancy and protection of the reserves.  Had there been a proper forest law in force, this form of control might not have so banefully affected the integrity of the forest domain, but since most of the so-called reservations existed (and still exist), merely at the whim of the Minister of the day, it was obviously unwise to entrust the all-important duty of protection and control to a Department whose primary function is to encourage settlement, which by common acceptation is construed to mean the alienation of all classes of land of the public estate.

	"As regards management, from the very commencement there has been no real power attached to the office of conservator, and therefore no real responsibility.  He has been the head of the staff of foresters and foremen, and has had control of the nurseries and the distribution of young trees, but from the time of his appointment in 1888, he does not appear to have been permitted to carry out any clear and definite policy in the management and working of the reserves.  To create this important appointment with the remuneration of 750 a year, and then under the system of control in force to hamper and restrict the occupant in important points of working, to allow the wretched system of fixed licences to remain in force with no practical limitation on methods of cutting, to employ him, in fact, as a subordinate clerk of the Lands Department useful to give information and advice on forest matters of detail, but to deliberately neglect to utilise any experience or capacity for organisation and management which he may have possessed, seems an almost incredible folly.  Yet this is virtually what happened.  Apart from any possible errors of judgment in business management, which might have been made by any man under similar conditions, the late Conservator appears to have honestly striven to do his duty to the State, to keep the more valuable reserves from alienation, and to protect and support his assistants in carrying out their often unpleasant duties.  The opposition to settlement within the reserves led to friction with both Ministers and officials of the Lands Department, and this divergence of opinion on matters of public policy appears to have resulted in further restriction of his already limited powers."

The principle provisions of the Forests Act 1907 included constitution of a Department of State Forests under a Minister of Forests, appointment of a conservator with necessary staff. confirmation and creation of permanently reserved forest and provision for future dedications, placement of control of timber on unoccupied timbered Crown land in the hands of the Forests Department and authorising collection of royalties on forest produce. From 1907 to 1918 progress was made in permanent forest dedication, strengthening control of timber utilisation, silviculture improvement of forests, extension of softwood planting, and the provision of fire protection safeguards. In 1910 the Victorian School of Forestry was established for the training of professional foresters. In 1918 the Forests Commission (VA 534) was established under the Forests Act 1918. Control of State forests was vested in the Commission and a statutory Forestry Fund was established for the improvement and development
of State forests.

Under the Forests Act 1958 (which is still the operating legislation as at 1994) State Forests comprise: 

	"Reserved forest" which comprises (a) areas dedicated as "permanent forest" which can be excised only by Act of Parliament or for specific public purposes, or by  exchange for  or unoccupied Crown land;  and (b) areas dedicated as timber reserves which can be alienated only by a resolution of Parliament or by exchange as in (a)

	"Protected forest" which comprises unoccupied Crown land proclaimed as such and certain defined unused roads. Such land is liable to be alienated. Reserved water frontages are also protected forest.

	Additions to a reserved forest can be made by the Governor in Council by (a) dedication of any area of Crown land on the joint recommendation of the Minister responsible;  or by exchange of existing reserved forest for Crown land on the joint recommendation of the Minister responsible;  or by exchange of existing reserved forest for  land on the recommendation of the Minister responsible;  or purchase or resumption of alienated land.

	Until 1983 the Forests Commission was vested with sole control and management of all areas of reserved forest. Protected forests were under dual control. the jurisdiction of the Forests Commission being restricted to control of the forest produce thereon.

The Forests portfolio was also concerned with the regulation of the timber industry and commercial enterprises involving the utilisation of state forests products such as eucalyptus oil, charcoal, sawn timber, pulpwood and firewood.  The Department also had close links with rural fire-fighting organisations.

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Land Act (No.1602) 1898 had made provision for the acquisition of land for the purpose of closers settlement.  The Board of Land and Works (VA 744) was authorised to repurchase  land and the object of this and subsequent legislation was to transform large estates into closely settled communities engaged in agriculture.  The repurchased land was made available as farm allotments, agricultural labourers' allotments and workmen's home allotments to suitable applicants under the terms of conditional purchase leases.  Certain residence and improvements conditions applied, initially for the first six years, after which time lessees were at liberty to mortgage, transfer or sub-let with consent and, on payment of the balance of the purchase money, to obtain a Crown Grant.  Subsequently lessees were also eligible to apply for advances to assist them to erect dwellings and outbuildings and for other approved purposes. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Although statutory responsibility for closer settlement was vested in the Board of Land and Works (VA 744), operational responsibility was exercised by the Closer Settlement Branch of the Department of Crown Lands and Survey (VA 538).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Establishment of Lands Purchase and Management Board&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Lands Purchase and Management Board was established in 1905 as a body corporate under the provisions of the Closer Settlement Act 1904 (No.1962). The powers of the Board of Land and Works (VA 744) under part (1V) of the Land Act 1901, were vested in the Lands Purchase and Management Board which was authorised to acquire land for the Crown either compulsorily or by agreement. The Board was authorised to dispose of land previously acquired and, with the approval of the Governor-in-Council, to dispose of any unalienated and unoccupied Crown land including any swamp or reclaimed Crown land. The Board allocated land to applicants under conditional purchase leases which required lessees to fence the land, to destroy vermin and noxious weeds and to make other improvements. The leases were granted subject to residence requirements and lessees of agricultural labourers' allotments and workmen's home allotments were required to erect a dwelling within one year.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Act authorised the Board to make advances to lessees to assist them to fence their land and to build the required dwellings and, at the request of the lessee, the Board could erect the required dwelling. The Board was also empowered to set aside land for townships and reserves;  to make improvements to the land prior to sale and to sell land as sites for churches, public halls, schools, cemeteries, butter factories and creameries, quarries and recreation reserves.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Relationship of Board to Department of Crown Lands and Survey (VA 538)&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Prior to 1905, the officers of the Closer Settlement Branch of the Department of Crown Lands and Survey had been responsible to the Secretary for Lands but following the establishment of the Lands Purchase and Management Board, the officers were to have been responsible to the Board whose Secretary was appointed by the Governor-in-Council, subject to the provisions of the Public Service Act. However the officers of the Board remained subject to the Department of Crown Lands and Survey (VA 538) in relation to promotions and matters of general discipline and their salaries were paid from the Department's salary vote.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1913, following concern expressed by the Minister and the Secretary of the Department of Crown Lands and Survey that the Closer Settlement Branch was not working effectively, it was agreed that a large part of the work of the Branch should be amalgamated with similar land settlement work being undertaken within the Department and divided control of the function was thus established. Administrative difficulties continued however and the chairman of the Board argued before the Royal Commission on Closer Settlement (1914) that these inefficiencies arose from there being dual control of the officers, whereby most were responsible to the Secretary for Lands and only ten or eleven were wholly responsible to the Secretary to the Board. The Royal Commission however was very critical of the Board's failure to organize its office properly and reported that ".....the Board does not appear to have taken charge of the Officers at all.  Throughout, the Department has controlled the Board."  The role of the Department in the administration of closers settlement continued to be significant until 1938 when complete responsibility was assumed by it.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Transfer of Responsibilities to the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission (VA 723)&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1913, under the provisions of the Closer Settlement Act 1912 (No.2438) certain powers of the Lands Purchase and Management Board were transferred to the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission (VA 723) which was authorised to acquire and dispose of lands for closer settlement purposes.  This transfer of authority applied only to land which was considered suitable for closer settlement under irrigation conditions and which was situated or likely to be situated within an Irrigation and Water Supply District within the meaning of the Water Act 1905. However the leases were to be issued by the Governor-in-Council;  the Commission was not to grant advances to lessees after the expiration of six years and after that period authority reverted to the Board. These restrictions were subsequently repealed by legislation.  (Closer Settlement Act 1918 (No.2987).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Establishment of the Closer Settlement Commission&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Closer Settlement Commission was established in 1933 under the provisions of the Closer Settlement Act 1932 (No.4091). Its establishment represented a consolidation of the administration of closer settlement and soldier settlement. The Act transferred to the Commission powers and obligations previously vested in the Closer Settlement Board (VA 2266) and the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission (VA 723) which had become responsible for the administration of closer settlement on irrigable lands from 1913 under the provisions of the Closer Settlement Act 1912 (No.2438).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Closer Settlement Commission was appointed by the Governor-in-Council and consisted of five members who were to include a chairperson, one person previously a member of the Closer Settlement Board, one person previously a member of the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission or an officer of that Commission who had been responsible for closer settlement and two persons having a knowledge of finance and primary production.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Powers of the Closer Settlement Commission&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Commission, with the approval of the Minister, could make use of the services of any of the officers and employees of the Department of Crown Lands and Survey (VA 538);  staff previously employed under the Closer Settlement Acts were deemed to have been appointed to temporary office in the Department and officers of the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission (VA 723) who had previously been engaged in the administration of closer settlement were transferred to the Public Service as officers of the Department of Crown Lands and Survey (VA 538).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In addition to powers concerning the acquisition and disposal of land the Act conferred on the Commission certain powers that had previously been the prerogative of the Minister or the Governor-in-Council. The Commission was also made responsible for the administration of the Land Act in so far as it related to lessees or licensees who had received advances under the Closer Settlement Acts and for the administration of the Seed Advances Acts, the Fallowing Advances Acts, the Cultivation Advances Act and part 1 of the Wire Netting Act 1928, these powers having been previously exercised by the Minister, the Board of Land and Works (VA 744) or the Closer Settlement Board (VA 2266).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Act removed restrictions on the transfer of leases and provided for the consolidation of debts arising from the issue of leases and the authorization of advances. The Commission was authorised to reassess the value of the land, to make annual adjustments of liabilities and in doing so to take into account the prices of farm products, seasonal conditions and the personal circumstances of the licensee or lessee.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Abolition of the Closer Settlement Commission.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1938, under the provisions of the Closer Settlement Act (No.4596), the Closer Settlement Commission was abolished. The Board of Land and Works (VA 744) was deemed its successor in law and statutory responsibility for the administration of the Closer Settlement Acts, Fallowing Advances Acts, Cultivation Advances Acts, part 1 of the Wire Netting Act 1928 and the Farmers Advances Acts was vested in the Board.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Closer Settlement Act 1938 was to be administered by the Department of Crown Lands and Survey (VA 538). No provision was made for the further acquisition of land;  the Closer Settlement, Discharged Soldiers' Settlement and Discharged Soldiers' Concession Funds were abolished and the funds were transferred to consolidated revenue. The Board of Land and Works (VA 744) was authorised to dispose of land under closer settlement leases, subject to the payment of a deposit of not less than ten percent of the lease or by auction or public tender. If the land could not be sold by auction or tender, the Board was authorised to dispose of it by  sale.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Act also provided for the issue of new leases to existing settlers and made provision for the adjustment and repayment of existing liabilities.  The new closer settlement leases were to be registered with the Registrar of Titles (VA 862) and all encumbrances including registered mortgages in respect of advances made or charges arising from the Advances to Settlers Act 1923, Wire Netting Act 1928, Vermin and Noxious Weeds Act 1928, Land Tax Acts and the Unemployment Relief Loan and Application Acts were to be endorsed on the leases. The Act also established conditions for the transfer, surrender and forfeiture of leases and for the issue of Crown Grants.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Department of Crown Lands and Survey (VA 538) continued to be responsible for the administration of Closer Settlement until the repeal of all legislation relating to closer settlement and authorisation of advances to farmers in 1982 under the provisions of the Closer Settlement (Winding-up) Act (No.9798).&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Reservation of coastal public land&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Most coastal land was originally reserved for public use according to a set of orders made in the 1870s and 1880s. Reservation was intended to guarantee public access to water by preventing the sale of any further Crown lands adjoining water bodies. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Coastal margins were originally retained to facilitate water transport and associated land access. In non-port areas they were usually regarded as easements, rights of way or land banks for possible future developments. Crown frontages to Port Phillip Bay were created as early as the late 1830s and from the early 1850s they were identified by surveyors as a matter of course right around the bay. Some of the beaches close to Melbourne were specially reserved as parks, gardens or for recreation in the mid and late 1860s but most were not given firm protection until 1873 when legislative steps were taken to remove a loophole which had allowed coastal land to be converted to freehold under section 42 of the Land Act 1865. In June 1873 all "unappropriated" Crown lands along the shores of Port Phillip Bay were permanently reserved. The remainder of the coastline was reserved over the next decade and on the 23 May 1881 a blanket reservation was made of all unalienated land within 1 and a half chains of the colony's " Rivers, Rivulets, Creeks, Channels, Aqueducts, Lakes, Reservoirs, Swamps, Inlets, Loughs and Straits".&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Coastal public land so reserved has traditionally been occupied on an annual permit or licence basis. These occupations generally fall under one of two categories: those for activities associated with recreational use of the frontage and adjoining waters, such as jetties, boatsheds, bathing boxes, boat and swimming club-houses, refreshment booths etc. Permits are issued by the local controlling body, usually the municipal council.  The second form of occupation is for grazing licenses where there is little or no public usage and no local controlling body. These licences are issued by the central government department responsible for the public lands function.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In addition special legislation has on occasions allowed proprietary rights to coastal lands for certain purposes. For instance, in St. Kilda, an Act in 1965 allowed the municipal council to enter into leases for a specified portion of the shore reserve for a maximum term of 50 years for the provision of a marina and restaurant. In 1967 statutory provision was made for leases for a maximum term of 21 years for surf life-saving associations.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Committees of Management&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Coastal public lands, in the same way as many other public lands reserved for public purposes, are directly controlled by Committees of Management which are appointed by the Minister responsible for public lands. In most cases the local municipal council is appointed, in others, local individuals are elected to the committees. These Committees of Management may obtain advice from, and in some matters are subject to statutory control by, the government agencies which deal with fire protection, land conservation, planning etc. Some coastal public lands are controlled directly by port authorities and other statutory bodies.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Co-ordination of coastal land management&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;By the mid 1960s it was realised that popular bayside and coastal beaches required measures for co-ordination of works and developments to ensure correct land use, the prevention of deterioration of the foreshore, the improvement of facilities and the identification and planned preservation of all natural assets. The Port Phillip Authority was established in 1966 to co-ordinate the development of the Port Phillip area and prevent further deterioration of the foreshore. Works and developments in the coastal zones defined as the Port Phillip Area had to be authorised by the Authority. The Port Phillip Coastal Planning and Management Act 1966 was repealed by the Planning and Environment Act 47/1987.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Port Phillip Area comprises public land including foreshore and inshore waters around Port Phillip Bay and between Cape Schanck and Barwon Heads (this latter area of control until 1980 only). Various bodies with statutory powers have specific responsibilities relating to either the Bay or the foreshore, such as Committees of Management, municipalities or public authorities. The Port Phillip Authority was established in 1966 in order to co-ordinate development as a result of this the multiplicity of control, management and responsibility.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1978, under the provisions of the Crown Land (Reserves) Act 1978, (No.9212) the Coastal Management and Co-ordination Committee (CMCC) was established with responsibility for the oversight of management and protection of the coastline of Victoria, except that around Port Phillip Bay. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1983 responsibility for both the Port Phillip Authority and the CMCC was transferred to the Minister for Planning and Environment placing responsibility for planning and co-ordination of management of all coastal lands (except major ports and national parks) within the ambit of one department. Thus all planning, management, works, funding and protection of coastal resources, as well as assistance with the preparation of management plans, in conjunction with other government agencies, committees of management and coastal municipalities, were administered by the newly established Coastal Unit within the Ministry of Planning and Environment. The Minister was responsible for approval of management plans, changes to plans and changes in use and development, and approval of leases, licences and permits.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;It is not clear exactly when the Port Phillip Authority ceased to exist but it would appear that the Coasts, Open Space and Waterways Branch within the Ministry for Planning and Environment undertook its functions after its demise around the early 1980s until the repeal in early 1988 of the Port Phillip Coastal Planning and Management Act 1966 by the Planning and Environment Act 47/1987 s.205. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;After the PPA Act was repealed in early 1988 the controls provided for in the Act were incorporated into the State Section of statutory plans and both the Minister for Planning and Environment and the Minister for Conservation, Forests and Lands were made Referral Authorities to consider and approve permits for works and developments in the Port Phillip Area. This statutory referral advice was co-ordinated at the State level through an Ad-hoc Committee established under the auspices of the Coastal Management and Co-ordination Committee.   Management changed again with the passing of the Coastal Management Act 1995 and the establishment of the Victorian Coastal Council with its associated regional councils.

Prior to 1853 baptisms, marriages and burials were recorded by church authorities.



Decentralised system of Registration, 1853 - 1960

Compulsory civil registration of Births, Marriages and Deaths in the State of Victoria began on 1 July 1853 with the proclamation of An Act for Registering Births, Deaths and Marriages in the Colony of Victoria (16 Vic., No.26). The Registrar-General's Department was established under the Act. A Chief Registrar, who reported to the Colonial Secretary (VRG 16) and later to the Chief Secretary (VRG 26), was appointed and had responsibility for the Deputy-Registrars who were assigned to various districts throughout Victoria for the purpose of registering all births, deaths and marriages.  The Department was also responsible for indexing, searching for, and issuing birth, death and marriage certificates.

Officers of the department also became responsible for performing civil marriages and the registration of the clergy following the proclamation of the Marriage Law Consolidation Act 22 Vic., No.71 in 1859.

From 1873 to 1893 responsibility moved to the Office of the Registrar-General and the Office of Titles (VA 862) which were amalgamated when the administration of the Registrar-General's Department transferred to the Law Department (VA 2825).

In 1893 with the proclamation of the Births, Deaths and Marriages Act (56 Vic., No.1303) responsibility passed to the Office of Government Statist and Actuary (VA 989) within the Chief Secretary's Department (VA 475) possibly formalising what may have already been happening in practice.

Metropolitan births, deaths and marriages were registered at the Registrar-General's Office and later at the Office of the Government Statist, 295 Queen Street, Melbourne.  Births, deaths and marriages occurring in the country regions of the State were registered with the local Registrars who were appointed by the Registrar-General and later by Assistant Government Statist.  Returns were forwarded to head office each quarter at the end of March, June, September and December.

Centralised system of Registration, 1961 - ct

A centralised system of registration for Births and Deaths was introduced in 1961 when the previous system of registration by District Registrars was abandoned in favour of central registration through head office, at 295 Queen Street, Melbourne.

Information Forms for Birth and Death registrations were an integral part of the registration system. 

In the case of births, informants, usually the parents of newly born children completed the form, available through hospitals, giving the necessary details for registration purposes and forwarded the form directly to the Office of the Government Statist, later the Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages, where registration of the birth would be effected. These forms were signed by one or both parents attesting the information therein to be true and correct.

In the case of deaths, Funeral Directors supplied the information form to the person arranging the funeral or a person with a knowledge of the facts who completed the form giving the necessary details for registration purposes and forwarded the form directly to the Office of the Government Statist, later the Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages, to effect registration of the death. These forms were signed attesting the information therein to be true and correct. The Funeral Director was also obliged to complete a form giving details of the burial of the body and a Medical Practitioner or Coroner, as the case may be, authorised the burial by completing a Medical Certificate of Death or Order of Burial. Registration of the death could not be effected until all of these papers had been received by the Government Statist or Registrar, as the position became known after the 1986 changes to the Act.

The federal Marriage Act 1961 had the effect of making laws governing marriages more uniform throughout Australia, however the registration function remained a State responsibility.

In September 1963, Commonwealth Registration Forms for marriages came into use and a more centralised system of registration was introduced.  Registrations were no longer effected by District Registrars and it became the responsibility of the Celebrant performing the marriage to forward the necessary papers to the Office of the Government Statist and Actuary for registration purposes.

From 1893 to 1983 the functions of the Office included statistical collection and registration of births, deaths and marriages under the Births, Deaths and Marriages Act 1893 (56 Victoria No.1303).  In 1983 the Government Statist and Actuary was transferred to the Department of Management and Budget (VA 1022). Although the Government Statist remained legislatively responsible for the registration of births, deaths and marriages until the proclamation of the Registration of Births, Deaths and Marriages (Amendment) Act 1985 (No.10244) on 31 October 1986 operational responsibility was exercised by the Assistant Government Statist (Chief Registration Officer) within the Department of Property and Services (VA 430). 

With the proclamation of the 1985 Act, legal responsibility passed to the Registrar of Births, Deaths, Marriages and the Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages (VA 983) was formally established. Services in relation to marriage are undertaken under delegation from the Federal Government pursuant to the Commonwealth Marriage Act 1961.  These services include the maintenance of a register of ministers and celebrants authorised to conduct marriage ceremonies, as well as powers in relation to the marriage of minors.

The Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages maintains records of all births, deaths, marriages, stillbirths, adoptions, legitimations and instruments of paternity which have occurred in Victoria since 1853.  It now also has responsibility for the early church records from 1837 to 1853 which are the only source of births and deaths information for that period.</description>

       <description type="full">Background

By 1880,  companies such as the Victorian Electric Company and the Australian Electric Company (later incorporated into the Melbourne Electric Supply Company Limited VA 3966) were generating and supplying electric power, mainly for lighting, to small areas within the City of Melbourne.  The same was also being done for specific areas or buildings by the Victorian Post-Master Generals Department and the Victorian Railways.  Between 1892  and 1894, the Melbourne municipality developed an undertaking to light the streets in the city proper.  Until 1896, there was no regulation or restriction on electric light and power undertakings.

Regulation

In 1896 the Government passed the Electric Light and Power Act No 1413 which was designed to regulate the electricity industry.  The Postmaster-General, the Board of Land and Works and the Victorian Railways were permitted to engage in electrical undertakings for Government purposes. All other works and suppliers required the authority of an Order-in-Council.  Municipalities were to have the power to supply electricity for public and  purposes.  Undertakings by companies also required the consent of the municipal Council for undertakings in a municipality.
Orders-in-Council for non-municipal undertakings were valid for no more than 30 years with the undertaking being able to be purchased by the municipality at the end of that time.  The Governor-in-Council might make regulations to secure public safety and Councils could make by-laws for the same purpose.

The Department of Public Works (VA 669) was given the responsibility of administering this Act.

Development

By the end of 1899 the provision of electric light and power in the city area was undertaken by the Melbourne City Council. In other areas the generation and supply of electricity was undertaken by the Melbourne Electric Supply Company Limited (VA 3966) and other  companies.  By 1904 these had been joined by the North Melbourne Electric Tramways and Lighting Company Limited (VA 2974).

Electricity was also supplied in non-Metropolitan areas  In 1891 the Nhill Electric Light Company established a small plant to serve the town of Nhill.  The Melbourne Electric Supply Company established electric light and power undertakings in Geelong in 1901 with the Electric Supply Company of Victoria doing the same in Ballarat (1905) and Bendigo (1903). In 1905,  companies inaugurated schemes in Hamilton, Inglewood and Kerang.  Between 1907 and 1913 some 34 electric undertakings were established in country towns with 18 of them being municipal schemes.




Victorian Railways

Electric power was viewed by the Victorian Railways (VA 2876) as a means of reducing the dependency on coal, particularly for the Melbourne suburban system.  The report of Charles Merz tabled in Parliament in 1908 recommended an electric suburban rail service with the suggestion of a powerhouse on the Morwell brown coalfield to supply Melbourne.  The recommendation for the electrification of the suburban rail system was supported by the Royal Commission on the Railway and Tramways Systems of Melbourne and Suburbs in 1911 and in 1912 Parliament authorised this with work on the first Newport Power Station being commenced in 1913.  Progress was interrupted by World War I and the first passenger carrying train ran in May 1919.

The Victorian Railways retained control of Newport A Power Station until 1951 and of the Newport B Power Station until 1939.

State Electricity Commission of Victoria (previously known as the Electricity Commissioners).

The Electricity Commissioners were constituted in 1919 under the provisions of the Electricity Commissioners Act 1918 (No.2996) and became the State Electricity Commission of Victoria (S.E.C.) under the provisions of the State Electricity Commission Act 1920 (No.3104). 

The Electricity Commissioners assumed responsibility for the administration of the Electric Light and Power Act from the Public Works Department (VA 669).

The State Electricity Commission was required:

(	to inquire into and report to the Government on the measures which should be taken to achieve the ultimate  co-ordination and amalgamation of all electrical undertakings in Victoria, and to secure the efficient inter-connection of such undertakings by the adoption of necessary standards of plant and equipment and system frequency and pressure 
(	to encourage and promote the use of electricity for industrial and manufacturing purposes and to report to the Government on the prospects of establishing new industries requiring large quantities of electrical energy
(	to carry out investigations to ascertain the extent of coal deposits or of water power suitable for use in connection with the generation of electricity
(	to carry out investigations as to the safety and most economical means of improving the generation, distribution, supply and use of electricity throughout Victoria.

The Commission was vested with the following powers in relation to electrical undertakings; 

(	to construct, maintain and operate electrical undertakings
(	to supply electricity in bulk to any statutory corporation or undertaking such as municipalities
(	to supply electricity to any person outside any area in which there is an existing undertaking and to Government departments and institutions
(	to carry on any business associated with an electrical undertaking
(	to make regulations as to precautions to be adopted in the use of electricity and to arrange for the licensing of electric wiremen
(	to develop brown coal mining and briquette manufacture
(	to develop hydro-electric resources
(	to register contractors, control installation methods and materials, and
(	test and trade in approved electrical equipment and appliances.

Acquisition of Electrical Undertakings

The Commission gradually acquired a number of electrical undertakings previously owned by  companies, municipalities and the Victorian Railways.  Between 1922 and 1953 the Commission acquired control of the following undertakings:

(	North Melbourne Tramways and Lighting Company in 1922
(	Melbourne Electric Supply Company in 1930
(	The Electric Supply Company of Victoria in 1934
(	Newport B Power Station from Victorian Railways in 1939
(	Melbourne City Council Spencer Street Power Station in 1941
(	Newport A Power Station from Victorian Railways in 1951
(	Mildura Electrical Undertaking in 1953

The S.E.C. continued to provide bulk supply electricity to certain metropolitan municipalities which then supplied their customers.

Restructure

The Electricity Industry Act 1993 commenced the restructuring of the State Electricity Commission of Victoria with its disaggregation into three statutory business undertakings with independent chairmen.  These were:

Generation Victoria  the production of power to meet the energy requirements of the system.
National Electricity (further reconstituted as PowerNet Victoria by the Electricity Industry (Amendments) Act 1994)  high voltage transmission, the balancing of supply and demand and for security of supply across the system.
Electricity Services Victoria  low voltage distribution and the sale of electricity to retail customers.

The Office of the Administrator was established by the same Act to oversee this restructuring and continues (as at January 2001) to be responsible for all residual rights and obligations of the SECV not allocated to the disaggregated electricity entities.

In 1994, the Electricity Industry (Amendments) Act abolished Electricity Services Victoria.  This Act also provided for the transfer of remaining municipal electricity undertakings to the distribution companies formed from Electricity Services Victoria.

The Victorian Power Exchange was created as a public authority to coordinate generation, transmission and distribution facilities.  Under further amendments to the Electricity Industry Act in 1997 it became part of VENCorp (Victorian Energy Networks Corporation). VENCorp is responsible for procuring bulk electricity services from network owners under long-term contracts, planning and directing the augmentation of the shared electricity transmission network and managing electricity emergencies.

Privatisation

Both Electricity Services Victoria (October 1994) and Generation Victoria (January 1995) were further disaggregated into five independent companies each.  The Electricity Industry (Amendments) Act 1995 allowed the Treasurer to provide for the sale or disposal of shares in these companies with these companies being subsequently sold to  interests.

The passing of the Electricity Industry (Loy Yang B) Act 1997 facilitated the sale of that power station.  In 1998, further amendments to the Electricity Industry Act 1993 abolished PowerNet and repealed the State Electricity Commission Act 1958.

The Office of the Regulator-General, established by the Office of the Regulator-General Act 1994, remains responsible for the oversight of licences relating to the electricity industry and for charges and tariffs.

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Price control was instituted as part of the defence responsibilities of the Commonwealth Government through the National Security (Prices) Regulations 1939.  A Prices Branch was established by the Department of Trade and Customs under a Commissioner with a Deputy Commissioner in each of the six states.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Following the Rents and Prices Referendum of May 1948, the Commonwealth Government relinquished responsibility for price control.  From September 1948, the State Government assumed responsibility for the administration of price control in Victoria.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;A Prices Decontrol Commissioner was appointed under the provisions of the Prices Regulation Act, 1948.  The Commissioner was appointed by the Governor in Council and was not subject to the provisions of the Public Service Act.  Under the provisions of the Prices Regulation (Amendment) Act 1951 the Commissioner became known as the Prices Commissioner.  The Prices Regulation Act also provided for the appointment of additional officers to administer price control in Victoria.  A Prices Control Branch (also known as the Victorian Prices Branch) was established and located within the Law Department (VA 864).  In 1950 the Minister in Charge of Prices was appointed and acquired responsibility for price control from the Attorney-General.&lt;BR /&gt;To ensure continuity a number of employees who were members of the Commonwealth Public Service remained with the agency once the function came under State jurisdiction whilst others were employed as part of the Victorian State Public Service.  Records were also transferred to the Victorian Prices Control Branch and provided the basis for the records created by the Branch.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Although price control in Victoria ended on 31 December 1954, the Minister did not resign his commission until March 1955.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Scope&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Price control, as administered under the Prices Regulation Act was to&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;   	prevent undue increases in prices and rates for goods, services and land, particularly food, clothing and housing during the period of post-war readjustment&lt;BR /&gt;   	regulate prices and rates for goods and services regarded as essential or which were in short supply&lt;BR /&gt;   	bring about the progressive removal of price control&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Businesses were required to furnish balance sheets and other accounts and statements and returns to the Prices Commissioner to assist in the monitoring and determination of prices and for determinations regarding the payment of subsidies.  The Prices Commissioner had the power to prosecute businesses which failed to furnish documentation or charged prices above the maximum set by the Prices Control Branch.&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1975 a Community Services Centre was opened by the Premier with an aim to create greater understanding between all members of society and to create equal opportunities for all. In particular, it was intended to provide information on the activities of government departments and instrumentalities, and also to provide a place for the public to put their problems to trained officers. Located within the Premier's Department (VA 2717), the Centre included several bureaux which carried out functions which later developed within the Premier's portfolio. The Anti-Discrimination Bureau pre-empted the introduction of the Equal Opportunity Act 1977 (No.9025). &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Equal Opportunity Act 1977 made it unlawful to discriminate on the grounds of sex (including sexual harassment) or marital status in certain areas. The Office of the Commissioner for Equal Opportunity (VA 1830) and the Equal Opportunity Board (VA 1417) were established under the provisions of the Equal Opportunity Act 1977 (No.9025).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Commissioner dealt with complaints under the Equal Opportunity Act through the process of negotiation and conciliation and referred unresolved complaints to the Equal Opportunity Board.  The Commissioner of Equal Opportunity was required to investigate:&lt;BR /&gt;	- complaints lodged with the Registrar of the Equal Opportunity Board&lt;BR /&gt;	- matters referred by the Board.&lt;BR /&gt;The Commissioner's role was investigative, conciliatory, and negotiation-oriented. Outside the metropolitan area complaints could be lodged with the clerk of a Magistrates Court.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Equal Opportunity Board acted as a tribunal to hear and determine unconciliated complaints and heard applications for exemptions from the provisions of the Equal Opportunity Act. The Board's function is adjudicative. The Board's proceedings were subject to appeal to the Supreme Court by way of re-hearing.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;From 1977 to 1983 the function encompassed:&lt;BR /&gt;		receipt, investigation, conciliation, negotiation and adjudication of complaints of discrimination on the grounds of sex (including sexual harassment) and marital status in the areas of employment, education, accommodation and the provision of goods and services, under the provisions of the Equal Opportunity Act 1977 (No.9025).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;From 1983 the function extended to include complaints received under the federal Racial Discrimination Act 1975 and the Human Rights Commission Act 1981, under a co-operative agreement between Victoria and the Commonwealth.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (No.10095) extended the grounds of unlawful discrimination to include race, impairment, political or religious beliefs and extended the areas to which the Act applied to include clubs which receive Government funding or which use Crown land.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Until 1984 complaints of discrimination on the grounds of race could be heard and conciliation undertaken as part of the ethnic affairs function. However, there was no legal sanction until proclamation of the 1984 Act. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Attorney General assumed responsibility for the hearing of racial discrimination complaints from the Minister for Ethnic Affairs (VRG 76) in 1984 and for the Equal Opportunity Commission from the Premier (VRG 50) in 1985.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Legislative Change&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The position of Commissioner was abolished under the 1993 Amendment Act and replaced with a position known as Chief Conciliator.  As at May 2001 the Commission comprises a Chairperson and four other members, one of whom is the full time Chief Conciliator.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Commission:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Resolves discrimination complaints lodged under the Equal Opportunity Act 1984. The Commission also receives complaints lodged under the federal Racial Discrimination Act 1975,, Sex Discrimination Act 1984 and the Disability Discrimination Act 1992. However all complaints made under federal law in Victoria are finalised by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission based in Sydney&lt;BR /&gt;Provides information about equal opportunity rights and responsibilities&lt;BR /&gt;Provides training and education programs and campaigns about equal opportunity, discrimination and harassment issues&lt;BR /&gt;Conducts research and provides advice on legal and policy issues related to discrimination and human rights.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Commission is a statutory authority that reports to Parliament via the Attorney-General.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Under the provisions of the Equal Opportunity Act 1995, the name of the Equal Opportunity Board was changed to the Anti  Discrimination Tribunal although its role and operations remained unchanged.  From the establishment of the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal, Anti-Discrimination hearings have been dealt with by the Anti-Discrimination List which is part of the Civil Division of the Tribunal.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Administration of the goldfields was based on a series of Goldfields Acts dating from 1853 when an "Act for the better management of the Goldfields", 17 Vic., No.4, was passed.  This Act provided for a system of mining leases and licences to be administered by the Commissioners of Crown Lands, who were also known as Goldfield Commissioners.  Earlier legislation (e.g. the 1851 and 1852 Acts 15 Vic., No.15 and 17 Vic., No.1) had made provision for the Commissioners to regulate mining on "waste lands of the Crown".  In 1855 the licensing system introduced in 1853 was replaced by a system of miners' rights administered by Local Courts which operated in designated districts, and had similar powers to a Court of Petty Sessions (18 Vic., No.37).  Members of the Courts were elected by holders of miners' rights in the district.  These arrangements were further refined by the 1857 Act 20 Vic., No.32 which set up a more complex administrative and judicial structure within specified Mining Districts comprising Mining Boards, Mining Wardens and Courts of Mines.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Mining Statute 1865 (No.291) and later Mines Acts extended this system to the regulation of all mining activities, providing also for the appointment of various District mining officials, including Mining Officers, Registrars and Surveyors.  The 1865 Statute also introduced provisions relating to mine safety.  These provisions were subsequently extended to include inspection and control of mines, their managers and engineers, mining equipment and equipment operators, mine ventilation, drainage and sludge abatement.  (For more detail see in particular the Mines Acts 1890 (No.1120), 1897 (No.1514), 1907 (No.2127) and 1958 (No.6320).)  Specific provision was made for coal mines in the 1909 Coal Mines Regulation Act (No.2240), which also provided for the establishment of a State Coal Mine.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;During the Gold Rush period local administration was paramount.  However from the 1860's increasingly the regulation of mining and associated functions became centralised in the Department of Mines (VA 2719) and its successor agencies the Department of Mines and Water Supply (VA 2720) and the Mines Department (VA 612)&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Formation, Scope and Major Functions of Mines Departments&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1860 a Commissioner of Mines was appointed and inherited responsibility in 1861 for the administration of the goldfields and regulation of mining activities from the Chief Secretary (VRG 26).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;For a brief period from 14 November 1861 to 27 June 1863, there was neither a Commissioner nor a Minister of Mines. During this period the Postmaster General was responsible for mining.  In 1863 a Minister for Mines was again appointed, inheriting responsibility for miners leases and surveys from Lands (VRG 18) in 1865 and 1864 respectively.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Between 1860 and 1977 the prime functions were:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;   	investigation of the State's geological structure, mineral wealth and groundwater resources&lt;BR /&gt;   	provision of technical services, financial assistance and information to the mining industry&lt;BR /&gt;   	licensing of mining activity&lt;BR /&gt;   	supervision of the safe working of mines, quarries, pipelines and on and offshore petroleum installations&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;During the 1870's and 1880's increased responsibility for safety standards in mines, mining accident relief funds and the credentialling of mining officials such as surveyors, mine managers and engine drivers was assumed.  From 1909 to 1911 the Minister was also responsible for the operation of the State Coal Mine (VA 720), a responsibility inherited by the Ministry of Railways (VRG 32)&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;With the development of oil exploration in the 1930's and the development of the off-shore oil and natural gas industries in the 1960's, the Department became responsible for the issuing of Petroleum Prospecting Licences, Petroleum Mineral Leases and Petroleum Exploration Permits and later for the regulation of pipelines, onshore and offshore petroleum installations and for the transportation and storage of inflammable liquids and liquefied gases.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1938 the Department assumed responsibility for the issuing of gold buyers licences from the Treasury (VA 865).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1977 the Minister for Minerals and Energy (VRG 47) assumed responsibility for all mining functions.&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The defence function does not include the individual military and naval units (Imperial and local) which comprised the Colonial armed forces (see armed forces ) or the nominal local command of the Imperial armed forces vested in the Colonial executive (see armed forces command).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;1836 to 1854&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;During this period defence of the Colony was under the nominal command of the Police Magistrate (18361839), later Superintendent (18391851), later LieutenantGovernor (1851-1854) although actual control was exercised from London (from 1836 to 1851 via the Governor of New South Wales).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The primary forces (military and naval) were Imperial regiments which drew their pay from the Military Chest supplied by the Imperial Government.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;1854 to 1870&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Defence activity was greatly stimulated by the outbreak of the Crimean war. In 1854 a select committee of the Legislative Council (the Select Committee on the Defence of the Colony) was appointed to take evidence and report upon the probable manner in which the Colony might be attacked.  The Committee recommended:&lt;BR /&gt;   	that an application should be made to the Imperial Government for a war steamer&lt;BR /&gt;   	that arms and ammunition should be purchased from the Royal Arsenal&lt;BR /&gt;   	that the strength of Imperial troops stationed in the Colony should be augmented&lt;BR /&gt;   	and that a local volunteer corps be established.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1854 an Act was passed authorising the enrolment of a volunteer corps to be placed under the supervision of Her Majesty's regular forces.  The Melbourne Volunteer Rifle Regiment, the Victorian Yeomanry Corps and the Geelong Volunteer Rifle Corps were established under this Act.  &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;At this time the Colony agreed to meet practically the entire expense of maintaining the Imperial forces and work began on the military barracks in St. Kilda Road and on batteries at Williamstown and Sandridge. Victoria also sent to England Commander W.N. Lockyer to superintend the building of an armed steamer for the defence of Port Phillip. The ship, the wooden steam sloop Victoria arrived in the colony in May 1856.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1858 the enthusiasm for defence in Victoria waned and a new agreement came into force whereby the Colony provided the requisite barrack accommodation and colonial pay and allowances for Imperial troops, while the British Government defrayed the Imperial pay and allowances of the regular troops. The Colonial Government was also responsible for expenditure on defence works. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Imperial Colonial Naval Defence Act 1865 provided for a colonial naval policy under which the colonies were able to provide, maintain and use their own vessels of war under prescribed conditions, to raise and maintain seamen for service and to raise and maintain volunteers for the Royal Naval Reserve. In May 1866 the Treasurer, Mr G.F. Verdon, proceeded to England to bring the subject of the defence of the Colony to the notice of the Imperial Government.  This resulted in the gift to the Colony of the Nelson in 1868 (which became the training ship for the Naval Brigade) and the contribution by the Imperial Government of 100,000 pounds towards the cost of the Cerberus (which arrived in the Colony in 1871).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Ministerial Responsibility&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;It is most likely that the Colonial Secretary (VRG 16) to 1855 and the Chief Secretary (VRG 26) after 1855 had some responsibility for the growing defence function.  Further research is required to establish this responsibility with certainty.  It is clear that from 1856 until 1857 the Chief Secretary had responsibility for defence co-ordination and policy with respect to Her Majesty's Regular Troops, the Commissariat, the Volunteer Forces and Staff and the Steam Sloop Victoria.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;From 1858 the Treasurer (VRG 23) appears to have assumed responsibility for central defence coordination and policy with respect to Military troops in Garrison, Local Staff, Stores, Barracks, the Volunteer Force and the Naval Training Ship Nelson.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;1870 to 1901&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1870 all Imperial troops were withdrawn from the Colony.  The defence of the Colony then rested entirely upon colonial volunteer forces and the defence issue became increasingly politically important.  After general elections in 1883 the new government appointed a Minister for Defence (VRG 38).  &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Besides the Victoria, Cerberus and Nelson the naval defences of the Colony in 1885 included the Childers, a firstclass torpedo boat, two secondclass torpedo boats and four harbour trust dredgers armed with old guns.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1884 the entire volunteer military force was disbanded and a militia defence force was established.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1887 an Australasian Naval Defence Force was established following a Colonial Conference in London. This force was jointly financed by the Imperial, New Zealand and six colonial governments.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Ministerial Responsibility&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1883 a Minister of Defence was appointed and a Council of Defence was established to direct and control the organization of Victorian naval and military forces, including the volunteer forces. With Federation in 1901, a Commonwealth Minister of Defence (VRG 87) assumed control of all Australian defence forces. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Further Research&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Further research is required to establish lines of responsibility for central administration and coordination of the armed forces prior to 1883 and the links to related agencies.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;As head of government, the Premier leads the Ministry and is responsible for relations with the Governor (VA 466) on behalf of the Ministry and for relations with the Commonwealth and other governments.  The Premier represents Victoria at the Premiers' Conference and at meetings of the Loan Council (from 1928), and advises the Queen on the appointment and dismissal of Governors and on the exercise of her powers and functions within Victoria.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;As chief spokesperson for both the Government and his/her party, the Premier is expected to have a comprehensive knowledge and understanding of the Government's policies and activities and, through the Cabinet (VA 2989) and the Department of the Premier and Cabinet (VA 1039), to exercise responsibility for the co-ordination and implementation of government policies and programmes.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In Victoria formal executive power, that is, the power to execute or apply the laws made by Parliament, is vested in the Crown and is exercised by the Governor as the Crown's representative, generally with the advice of the Executive Council (VA 2903).  The Constitution provides for the appointment by the Governor of a specified number of officers from the Legislative Assembly (VA 2585) and Legislative Council (VA 471) as Ministers of the Crown.  These Ministers are also appointed as members of the Executive Council.  In practice executive power is exercised by the Ministers of the Crown.  Thus the Governor generally exercises his/her legislative and executive powers on the advice of and through the Ministers of the Crown who form the Cabinet in their capacity as members of the Executive Council.  In reality the exercise of formal powers by the Governor with the advice of the Executive Council gives effect to Cabinet and Ministerial decisions.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Following an election the Governor invites the Parliamentary leader of the political party or coalition of political parties commanding a majority in the lower House, in Victoria the Legislative Assembly, to form the Government.  By convention a Government holds office only while it retains the majority support of the legislature.  On losing that support the Chief Minister or Premier is expected either to hand in the resignations of his/her Ministry or to recommend a dissolution and general election, a request which the Governor may refuse, particularly if an alternative leader can demonstrate that she/he can command a legislative majority.  The Premier may recommend a general election at any time within the maximum term of the legislature and if she/he commands a majority in the Legislative Assembly, it is likely that this advice will be accepted by the Governor.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Premier is elected by a ballot of the Parliamentary members of his/her party.  Although by convention it is the Chief Minister who nominates for appointment all other Ministers and who can recommend their dismissal, in practice in Victoria, it is now caucus which elects the members of the Ministry, though the Liberal Party reserves two positions for the nominees of the Premier.  The allocation of portfolios however is the prerogative of the Premier.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Summary of Head of Government Role&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The main functions associated with this role are:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;		leadership of the Ministry/Cabinet and chief spokesperson for the Government&lt;BR /&gt;		liaison with the Governor, other Governments and the Commonwealth&lt;BR /&gt;		provision of advice to the monarch on behalf of the Victorian Government.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Historically, the department of the head of government also provided corporate  services to the:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;	  Governor&lt;BR /&gt;		Executive Council&lt;BR /&gt;		Cabinet&lt;BR /&gt;		Auditor-General&lt;BR /&gt;		Public Service Board/Commissioner&lt;BR /&gt;		Ombudsman.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;History of the Head of Government Role&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Until 1855 the Governor was the head of the executive arm of Government both formally and in practice.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The 1855 Victorian Constitution Act contained a number of provisions which established the preconditions for far-reaching changes in the balance of power between the Governor , the principal officers in the administration, the Ministers of the Crown under the leadership of the Chief Minister, and the legislature.  Although the Governor continued to exercise legislative, financial and executive powers in a formal sense, he/she did so generally on the advice of the Ministers of the Crown in their capacity as members of the Executive Council.  Real executive power under the new formal arrangements from 1855 - and in accordance with conventions associated with the notion of responsible government - has rested with the group of Ministers who form the Cabinet, hold office with the support of Parliament and are summoned to the Executive Council.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Until 1874 the Chief Secretary was regarded as the Prime, or first, Minister and exercised the responsibilities of his portfolio as well as those of the Head of the  Administration. In 1874 the title of Premier was first applied to the Head of the Administration when G.B. Kerferd, commissioned as Attorney-General, was asked by the Governor to reconstruct the Administration upon the resignation of J.G.  Francis, then Chief Secretary, who became ill. The Attorney-General assumed the title Premier, in addition to his Ministerial office, and the portfolio of Chief Secretary was left vacant. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;This separation of the position of Premier from the portfolio of Chief Secretary set a trend which continued from 1874 until 1936. During this period the role of head of government was held by Ministers variously commissioned as:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;1874-1875: Attorney-General (VRG 19)&lt;BR /&gt;1875-1877: Treasurer (VRG 23)&lt;BR /&gt;1877-1880: Chief Secretary &lt;BR /&gt;1880-1880: Treasurer &lt;BR /&gt;1880-1881: Chief Secretary and Treasurer&lt;BR /&gt;1881-1883: Attorney-General and Treasurer&lt;BR /&gt;1883-1892: Treasurer &lt;BR /&gt;1892-1893: Attorney-General&lt;BR /&gt;1893-1894: Chief Secretary &lt;BR /&gt;1894-1899: Treasurer &lt;BR /&gt;1899-1900: Chief Secretary&lt;BR /&gt;1900-1902: Treasurer &lt;BR /&gt;1902-1903: Attorney-General &lt;BR /&gt;1903-1909: Treasurer &lt;BR /&gt;1909-1912: Chief Secretary &lt;BR /&gt;1912-1917: Treasurer &lt;BR /&gt;1917-1918: Chief Secretary &lt;BR /&gt;1918-1919: Attorney-General &lt;BR /&gt;1920-1920: Solicitor-General (VRG 19)&lt;BR /&gt;1921-1924: Minister of Water Supply (VRG 36)&lt;BR /&gt;1924-1924: Treasurer &lt;BR /&gt;1924-1927: Minister of Water Supply &lt;BR /&gt;1927-1936: Treasurer &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;On 23 December 1936 the Premier, as head of government in Victoria, became a commissioned Ministerial office with salary and separate portfolio responsibilities. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Between 1936 and 1982 the Premier also held the portfolio of Treasurer.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Administrative Support for Head of Government Role&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Administrative support for the head of government function was initially provided by the Chief Secretary's Office within the Chief Secretary's Department (VA 475).  In 1883, in view of the fact that from 1874 the head of government was no longer invariably the Chief Secretary, separate administrative arrangements were made and a Premier's Department or Office (VA 672) was established.  &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;From 1884 to 1890 this Office functioned as a sub-department within the Department of the Treasurer (VA 865);  from 1890 to 1894 as a separate Department of State;  from 1894 to 1928 as a sub-department within the Chief Secretary's Department;  and from 1928 to 1936 again as a sub-department within the Department of the Treasurer.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The functions of the Premier's Department on its establishment were set down in an Order-in-Council of 29 May 1883:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;		correspondence with other colonies, governments and the Agent-General&lt;BR /&gt;		correspondence with the Governor, including despatches from the Secretary of State in Britain referred by the Governor to Ministers&lt;BR /&gt;		matters referred to the Premier and Cabinet by other Ministers or departments for their consideration&lt;BR /&gt;		other matters concerning the Premier&lt;BR /&gt;		issuing Cabinet circulars and attending upon Cabinet&lt;BR /&gt;		matters relating to the Public Service as a whole.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Office's role in the central co-ordination of Government policy gradually expanded.  Following Federation in 1901 it also became responsible for relations with the Commonwealth and other States.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;From December 1936, the Department of the Premier (VA 2717) and from 1982 the Department of the Premier and Cabinet (VA 1039) assisted the Premier in his/her head of government functions and the co-ordination of government policies and programs. The primary activities of the Department of the Premier included:&lt;BR /&gt;		co-ordination of Government and Cabinet business, policy and programs (see also VA 2989 Cabinet)&lt;BR /&gt;		liaison with the Governor&lt;BR /&gt;		provision of advice to the monarch&lt;BR /&gt;		relations with other Governments, including other State Governments and the Commonwealth&lt;BR /&gt;		protocol and public relations.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The functions of the Department of Premier and Cabinet were defined by an Order-in-Council of 12 October 1982 and in summary are:&lt;BR /&gt;		developing a co-ordinated administrative response to Government policies and priorities&lt;BR /&gt;		monitoring the implementation of Government policy and co-ordinating the activities of departments and agencies within the public sector&lt;BR /&gt;		providing assistance with the development of policy proposals for Cabinet&lt;BR /&gt;		providing the Premier and Cabinet with advice on agency initiated policy proposals and priorities for the legislative programme&lt;BR /&gt;		providing support services for the Cabinet (VA 2989) and its committees.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Department is also responsible for the administration of inter-governmental relations, particularly with the Commonwealth and other states, and protocol matters related to the Premier's role as head of government.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;NOTE:	From 1936 to 1982, as the Premier was also the Treasurer, the Department of the Treasurer or Treasury (VA 865) may also have performed support functions for the head of government role, including co-ordination of Cabinet business.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Federal Affairs&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;A Minister for Federal Affairs was appointed in 1975 and assumed responsibility from the Premier for:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;		assisting the Premier with Federal/State matters&lt;BR /&gt;		liaison with the Council of States which was established to foster closer co-operation between the governments of Victoria, Queensland, New South Wales and Western Australia in the light of the impact on State functions of the first Labour Commonwealth Government for two decades&lt;BR /&gt;		liaison between Commonwealth and State departments&lt;BR /&gt;		monitoring the impact of Commonwealth legislation on State functions&lt;BR /&gt;		co-ordination of State government submissions to the Commonwealth.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Although the Premier was not necessarily the Minister for Federal Affairs, the portfolio of Federal Affairs has been included in the Premier's portfolio as no separate administrative unit with its own record keeping system was established.  A Ministry of Federal Affairs was established but as a division of the Department of the Premier (VA 2717) and has therefore not been registered as a separate agency.  Researchers seeking access to federal affairs material should see VA 2717.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1982 the Minister for Federal Affairs resigned and no re-appointment was made, the Premier resuming full responsibility for Federal/State relations.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Administrative Structure from October 1992&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Since October 1992 the Department of Premier and Cabinet has comprised:&lt;BR /&gt;		Cabinet Office (see Executive)&lt;BR /&gt;		Office of Public Sector Management and Co-ordinator General (see Public Service)&lt;BR /&gt;		Office of State Administration&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The functions of the Office of State Administration are:&lt;BR /&gt;		to advise and assist the Pre... truncated</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Hospitals and Charitable Institutions Act 1864 required the incorporation of any institution, society or association, which was funded entirely or in part by voluntary contributions, and which had been established with the object of saving human life, promoting health, temperance or morality, preventing cruelty or vice or for other philanthropic or humane purposes. Such institutions were required to be governed by trustees and committees or boards of directors elected by contributors. Grants in aid were issued to the institutions subject to the condition that they submit statements of accounts and returns of  contributions to the Treasurer. (See Estimates and Appropriations 1864).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;An Inspector of Public Charities appears to have been first appointed in late 1880 within the Department of the Treasurer (VA 865). (See First Report of the Inspector of Public Charities, Papers Presented to Parliament, Session 1881, Vol.3). The position of Inspector had been recommended by the Royal Commission of 1870. The inspector undertook the investigation of the management, and audit of the accounts, of institutions receiving assistance from the Government.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Charities Board of Victoria 1923 to 1948&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Charities Board of Victoria (VA 2707) was established in 1923 under the provisions of the Hospitals and Charities Act 1922 (No.3260). The Board was responsible for benevolent societies and institutions which were supported in whole or in part by voluntary contributions and which had as one of their objects the provision of "charitable relief to diseased, infirm, incurable, poor or destitute persons (including children and convalescent patients)".&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Many institutions were to be exempt from the provisions of the Act. These included institutions wholly maintained by the State;  institutions established under the provisions of the Lunacy Acts, Mental Treatment Act 1915 and Inebriates Act 1915;   hospitals receiving no aid from the State;  municipal hospitals and institutions;  institutions established by the Commonwealth Government;  the Queen's Memorial Infectious Diseases Hospital at Fairfield and the Sanatorium at Heatherton for patients suffering from tuberculosis.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Charities Board was responsible for determining what charitable relief was required to meet the needs of diseased, infirm, incurable, poor or destitute persons resident in Victoria and which institutions or benevolent societies should be subsidized.  The Board was also responsible for the allocation of funds from the Hospitals and Charities Fund which was to be established and kept in the Treasury in accordance with section 42 of the Act.  The Board could recommend to the Minister that subsidized institutions be closed or amalgamated and that subsidized benevolent societies cease to exist, if they believed them to be mismanaged or to be failing to effectively provide the services for which they were responsible.  The Board could also recommend for what purposes a subsidized institution should be used.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;From the commencement of the Act no institution or benevolent society could be established without the prior consent of the Board and all existing institutions and societies were to apply to be registered with the Board.  Unregistered institutions and societies were not eligible to receive funds from the Hospitals and Charities Fund, consolidated revenue or municipalities and were prevented from making appeals for voluntary contributions.  The Board was empowered to refuse or cancel the registration of an institution.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Act further provided for the incorporation and government of hospitals and philanthropic institutions other than those run by religious denominations;  the regulation of fund raising;  the liability of patients for the cost of their care and treatment;  the resumption of land for the benefit of institutions and the making and publication of regulations.  The second and third schedules to the Act listed the names of existing incorporated institutions and separate institutions (i.e. those established by religious denominations).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1944 responsibility for administration of the Hospitals and Charities Acts was assumed by the Minister of Health (VRG 39).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Hospitals and Charities Commission 1948 to 1978&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1948 following the proclamation of the Hospitals and Charities Act 1948 (No.5300) the powers and responsibilities of the Charities Board were assumed by the newly established Hospitals and Charities Commission (VA 693). The Commission assumed responsibility for functions previously administered by the Charities Board.  The Commission consisted of three full time members appointed by the Governor-in-Council, of whom one was to be a person qualified in hospital administration.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In summary the functions for which the Commission was responsible were:&lt;BR /&gt;establishment and management of public hospitals and later community health centres&lt;BR /&gt;midwifery and infant care&lt;BR /&gt;ambulance services&lt;BR /&gt;recruitment, training and conditions of employment for nurses&lt;BR /&gt;training of hospital administrators&lt;BR /&gt;classification and training of medical staff&lt;BR /&gt;registration and management of agencies providing residential care for the aged, the destitute, children, convalescent and chronically ill patients and physically or sensorily disabled persons.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Hospitals and Charities Commission, like its predecessor, was responsible for determining what charitable relief was required to meet the needs of persons resident in Victoria and which institutions and benevolent societies should be subsidized.  The Commission was also responsible for the financial administration of the Hospitals and Charities Fund and for the allocation of funds for salaries and expenses of the Commission and its officers and employees, for the establishment and maintenance of subsidized institutions and benevolent societies and for capital works and the purchase of equipment.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Commission was responsible for the registration and inspection of  hospitals and unsubsidized institutions and the administration and financial management of all subsidized institutions and benevolent societies.  Under certain conditions the Commission could recommend the closure or amalgamation of subsidized institutions other than those run by religious denominations.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Act required that institutions and benevolent societies other than those exempt from the provisions of the Act (see section 4) be registered with the Commission which was empowered to cancel or amend the registration of an institution.  Unregistered institutions were not eligible to receive government funding and were prohibited from seeking voluntary contributions and no institution could be established without the prior consent of the Commission.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;One of the major functions of the Commission was the co-ordination and rationalisation of hospital and institutional activities and it was empowered to make recommendations regarding the amendment of existing legislation and proposals for "the improvement of and prevention of overlapping in, the administration of institutions and benevolent societies" (section 18).  The Commission exercised control over the allocation of funds and institutions were required to submit their budgets for approval.  The Commission also exercised control over capital works and could determine the location and extent of all new buildings, the accommodation to be provided and the allocation of beds between , intermediate and public wards.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Commission was also empowered to establish a bureau to assist in the admission of patients to hospitals and to furnish information in relation to nursing and hospital matters;  to authorise or require the committee of management of any hospital to establish facilities for the care of convalescent or incurable persons and for persons suffering a chronic illness and to require hospitals to establish and maintain district nursing services and ambulance services.  All ambulance services were to be registered and were subject to the supervision of the Commission.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Commission, at the request of the Commission of Public Health (VA 694), could also arrange for the supervision of units established for the care of persons suffering from tuberculosis but the admission and treatment of patients remained the responsibility of the Commission of Public Health.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Commission was required to promote and arrange for the collective buying of standard equipment, furnishings and supplies and it maintained an Equipment Section which assessed and made recommendations as to the purchase of major items of furniture and equipment.  The collective purchasing of standard equipment was arranged through the Victorian Hospitals' Association, a non profit company in which the hospitals were shareholders.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Commission was to establish a system of training for hospital administrators and in consultation with the Nurses Board to make provision for the training of nurses.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Hospitals and Charities Act 1948 also provided for the incorporation and government of hospitals and philanthropic institutions, the liability of patients, the resumption of land for the benefit of an institution and the compensation of the owners of the land, and the regulation of fund raising activities.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Establishment of the Health Commission&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1978, following the proclamation of the Health Commission Act 1977 (No.9023), the Health Commission of Victoria (VA 652) was established in accordance with the recommendations of the Committee of Inquiry into Hospital and Health Services in Victoria whose report had been presented to the Minister of Health (VRG 39) in July 1975.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The establishment of the Health Commission represented a major re-organisation of health services in Victoria and for the first time responsibility for the central administration of health services was vested in a single agency.  The Health Commission assumed responsibility for all functions previously administered by the Department of Health I (VA 695), the Mental Health Authority (VA 692), the Commission of Public Health (VA 694) and the Hospitals and Charities Commission.  The Health Commission Act 1977 also provided for the transfer to the Public Service of all staff previously employed by the Hospitals and Charities Commission.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Hospitals Division of the Health Commission assumed responsibility for:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;administering the Hospital and Charities Acts and the  Hospitals section of the Health Act of 1958 (Sections 178-186)&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;planning, developing, monitoring and controlling the operation of hospitals, ambulance services, some community health centres and extended care facilities&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;registering both government and  hospitals, nursing homes, benevolent societies and other institutions&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;training and educating medical, nursing and other health service personnel, and staffing government hospitals and institutions&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;providing medical assessment, treatment, referral and paramedical in-patient and out-patient services &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;providing food services to hospitals etc and Meals-on-Wheels to the community&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;providing an interpreter and migrant health service and extended care and transport service to the aged and disabled&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;administering fund raising appeals&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;undertaking research into improving and treating community health, developing and implementing innovations where appropriate and formulating policy regarding technology in the health area.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1856 Governor Hotham appointed a Board of Inquiry to investigate arrangements for the better organisation of the permanent Public Service.  Its report (initially confidential but subsequently published as a Parliamentary Paper) recommended a system whereby all permanent recruits were initially examined and appointed by a central examining board with subsequent promotions on the basis of merit by a permanent board. Power to appoint department heads and permanent chief officers presided by a minister were to be appointed by the Governor in Council.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;It does not appear as though these recommendations were initiated, as a Royal Commission was held in 1859.  Although this Commission criticised a perceived absence of any general rules regarding appointments, promotions, etc it essentially stated that such matters were best left to the departmental heads.  This approach was basically consolidated in the Civil Service Act 1862.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Another Royal Commission was established in 1870 and produced a final report in 1873 which recommended the principle of a single public service for all departments and the formation of a permanent Board to administer a system where all appointments, etc were made on merit.  The aim of these recommendations was to end appointments and promotions made by political patronage and to limit the appointments of supernumeraries (additional officers).  Supernumeraries were not permanent officers and as such did not have to sit the appointment examination.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Establishment of the Public Service Board&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Public Service Board was established under Section 4 of the Public Service Act 1883 to carry out the provisions of the act, which essentially incorporated the recommendations of the 1873 Royal Commission.  It initially comprised three persons appointed by the Governor in Council. A permanent servant could also be appointed to act as Secretary to the Board.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;It provided independent advice to the Government relating to the following broad aspects of Public Service administration for most of its existence:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;	determination of organisation and administrative structures, particularly with respect to the classification of public servants &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;	determination of equitable and fair employment provisions for public servants, particularly through the establishment and maintenance of systems (including appeal mechanisms) for the appointment, promotion and termination on the grounds of merit, and &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;	determination of general staffing and management arrangements through the determination of uniform conditions such as leave arrangements, the Public Service Regulations and punishments for breaching regulations.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The composition and title of the Board has been subject to change.  The original composition of three members was replaced by a single member known as the Public Service Commissioner by the Public Service Act 1901.  A three member Public Service Board was re constituted by the Public Service Act 1940.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Board was originally formed as part of the Premier's Office established in 1883 to provide administrative support to the head of government and which was initially a sub-department of the Department of the Treasurer.  In 1894 the Chief Secretary assumed responsibility for the Premier's Office and staff of the Public Service Board were transferred to the Chief Secretary's Department.  In 1928 responsibility for the Premier's Office transferred back to the Department of the Treasurer, however the staff of the Public Service Commissioner (as the agency was known at this time) did not transfer to the Department of the Treasurer until 1936, before transferring to the Department of the Premier in February 1937.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Public Service Act was amended on a number of occasions after 1883 although these amendments do not appear to have significantly changed the basic role of the Board. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Three further investigations of the Public Service were held in this period:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;	A Royal Commission appointed on 17 February 1916 to report on `the workings of the Public Departments ... excepting the Railways Department'&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;	A 1926 Board of Inquiry into the methods of the Public Service including the existence and incidence of `extravagance, overlapping or overstaffing', and&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;	A Board of Inquiry to inquire upon the role, organisational structure, management and staffing of the Public Service.  The recommendations of this Board directly led to the framing of the Public Service Act 1974.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;By 1981 there was a major change in emphasis with the Board largely dealing with the formulation of policy, the provision of a range of consultancy services to Government and the development of a more responsive and performance oriented personnel system.  To reflect this shift in emphasis of the Board's activities, a major restructuring was undertaken including a wide range of personnel delegations to most departments.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Subsequent Agencies&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The teaching service was removed from the Public Service by the Public Service and the Teaching  Service Acts (Nos 5124 and 5125 of 1946).  The Teachers Tribunal (VA 2311) was established to exercise in relation to the teaching service some of the functions exercised in relation to the public service by the Public Service Board.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt; The Promotions Appeals Board (VA 1418) was established to consider appeals from officers concerning their failure to be provisionally promoted to offices in the Second and Third Divisions. Thus the Public Service Board was relieved of this function (refer to the Public Service Act 1974 : proclaimed on 1 August 1975)&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Board was abolished under the provisions of the Public Sector Management Act 1992.  It was replaced by the Office of the Public Service Commissioner which was attached to the Department of Premier and Cabinet.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The specific duties of the Commissioner were set out in Section 45 of the Act.  These could be summarised as the following broad functions:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;*	determination of public sector employment policies, including the development, establishment and application of guidelines, procedures, a code of conduct for public servants and merit selection principles including the establishment of review and appeal mechanisms through the appointment of a Tribunal and grievance mediator&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;*	advisory responsibilities regarding public sector employment issues including remuneration and personnel policy and practice, and&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;*	responsibility for the establishment of selection committees and recruitment of Department Heads and prescribed officers identified in Section 17(1) of the Act.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Commissioner was required to act independently in performing these duties and was assisted by an Office under his/her control.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Office of the Public Service Commissioner was replaced by the Public Sector Management and Employment Act 1998 by the statutory Commissioner of Public Employment.  The Office of Public Employment supports the Commissioner who has a set of statutory functions with reference to public employment and oversight of public employment&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Since proclamation of the Workers' Compensation Act 1914 employers have been obliged to obtain accident insurance policies indemnifying them against their liability in relation to payment of accident compensation to workers or their dependants. The operation and administration of workers' compensation legislation has, over time, been undertaken by a number of public and  bodies. The nature of the function has also evolved. Below is a summary of the evolution of the statutory workers' compensation systems.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;To 1914&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;A worker traditionally had the right to sue his employer at common law for civil damages for loss suffered through the negligence of the employer. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The role of the Government was limited to the Courts which heard such cases.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;1914 to 1985&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Workers' Compensation Act 1914 gave certain workers and their dependants the right to claim limited compensation from their employer, without proof of negligence or breach of statutory duty by the employer, in respect of accidental injuries sustained by them arising out of and in the course of their employment. The right to take action at common law was not removed by this Act. The general principle of the legislation was to cover workers who had entered into or who worked under a contract of service or apprenticeship with an employer, whether by way of manual labour, clerical work or otherwise.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Act remained substantially unchanged, apart from variations in benefits, until 1938 when the Workers Compensation Board was established by the Workers' Compensation Act 1937 (No.4524). The Workers' Compensation Board was vested with power to&lt;BR /&gt;receive and accept or refuse to accept compensation claims&lt;BR /&gt;hear and determine disputes arising out of compensation claims (see workers compensation arbitration)&lt;BR /&gt;identify diseases and corresponding processes or occupations&lt;BR /&gt;inquire into schemes of compensation.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Substantial changes to the Act occurred in 1946. The definition of "injury" was widened to include virtually any disabling event occurring at work, however, this change was reversed in 1965. In 1946 the benefits of the Act were also extended to persons travelling between their home and work. In 1953 an important provision was introduced to enable claimants to be paid compensation from the Workers Compensation Board Fund if their employer was uninsured and without assets. The class of persons entitled to benefit, the scope of employment, the types of injuries included, and the extent of the benefits were all changed by amendments to the original Act.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Under the Workers' Compensation Act 1914 the Government established the State Accident Insurance Office to provide accident insurance policies indemnifying employers against their liability under the Act or under common law. The Government commenced the provision of this form of insurance to protect the employers from exploitation by  insurance companies. The Government also regulated the  insurance companies offering accident insurance. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The role of the Courts also widened in 1914. Apart from hearing civil cases under common law, responsibility for hearing and determining disputes arising out of the statutory workers' compensation system was vested in County Court Judges and Police Magistrates. In 1938 the Workers' Compensation Board assumed responsibility for cases arising out of the statutory compensation system (see workers compensation arbitration).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;A Board of Inquiry into Workers Compensation in Victoria was constituted in 1976 and submitted its final report in March 1977.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;1985 to 1992&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The WorkCare workers' compensation system was established in 1985 following proclamation of the Accident Compensation Act 1985 and the Occupational Health and Safety Act 1985. The objectives of the legislation were to reduce the social cost of workplace accident compensation by reducing the incidence of accidents and diseases in the workplace and to provide for the compensation and rehabilitation of injured workers. WorkCare was introduced therefore as an integrated system with greater focus on prevention of accidents through occupational health and safety and on rehabilitation services.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Under WorkCare the Government assumed an even greater role than previously. The Accident Compensation Commission was established as the primary insurer for workers' compensation. In effect the Commission assumed all insurance business from  insurance companies although the  companies continued to function as claims administration agents of the Commission. The only exception to insuring with the State was the option of being a licensed self-insurer. This was only possible for the largest corporations. In its role as the prime insurer the Accident Compensation Commission was also vested with responsibility for &lt;BR /&gt;determining and collecting the levy payable under the Act (through the Levy Collection Agency of the State Taxation Office, established for this purpose)&lt;BR /&gt;receiving, assessing and accepting or disputing claims for compensation;  &lt;BR /&gt;payment of compensation to entitled persons &lt;BR /&gt;administration of the Accident Compensation Fund (undertaken through Fund Management agents)&lt;BR /&gt;defending applications for review before the Accident Compensation Tribunal; &lt;BR /&gt;promotion and funding of workers' rehabilitation&lt;BR /&gt;identifying proclaimable diseases in relation to places, processes or occupation for the purpose of section 87 of the Act and advising the Governor-in-Council, through the responsible Minister, for the proclamation of these in the Government Gazette&lt;BR /&gt;research and educational programmes and maintenance of statistical records.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Levy Collection Agency registered employers and establishments, collected levy, and detected undeclared or underdeclared levy.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Accident Compensation Tribunal was established to succeed the Workers' Compensation Board as an independent appeals body to determine disputes arising within the WorkCare system.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Victorian Accident Rehabilitation Council was established to co-ordinate the provision of rehabilitation services to injured workers.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;A related agency established as a component of the WorkCare scheme was the Occupational Health and Safety Commission (VA 1647) responsible for developing policies to prevent workplace accidents and setting workplace safety standards. The Commission was supported by the Occupational Health and Safety Division of the Department of Labour (VA 2777) which was responsible for the implementation, inspection, and supervision of the standards established by the Commission (see health and safety (workplace)).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The co-ordination of the WorkCare agencies was undertaken by the WorkCare Unit of the Department of Management and Budget. The Department of Management and Budget also undertook the approval and monitoring of self-insurers.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Accident Compensation (Amendment) Act 1989 provided for the establishment in March 1990 of the WorkCare Appeals Board and the Medical Panels. The WorkCare Appeals Board provided a non-legalistic mechanism for appeal against decisions of the Accident Compensation Commission or self-insurers in relation to entitlement to compensation or to the amount of compensation or other payments. The Medical Panels provided independent medical advice to the WorkCare Appeals Board, the Accident Compensation Tribunal, and to workers, their advisers and claims agents.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In March 1990 responsibility for all areas of WorkCare (including the Accident Compensation Commission, the Accident Rehabilitation Council, the WorkCare Appeals Board, the Medical Panels and the Accident Compensation Tribunal) was transferred from the Treasurer (VRG 23) to the Minister for Labour (VRG 86), who had previously had responsibility for occupational health and safety only. A WorkCare Co-ordination Unit was established in the Department of Labour assuming responsibility for the co-ordination of the WorkCare agencies and for the approval and monitoring of self-insurers previously undertaken by the Department of Management and Budget.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;On 18 March 1991 responsibility for the Accident Compensation Tribunal was transferred to the Attorney-General (VRG 19).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In March 1992 the Minister for Finance, as Minister assisting the Minister for Labour, was given concurrent but primary responsibility for WorkCare matters.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;1992 to ct&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;A new system of workers' compensation was introduced 1 December 1992 under the Accident Compensation (WorkCover) Act 1992. The Act established WorkCover to replace the WorkCare system. The second stage of legislative reform was introduced by the Accident Compensation (WorkCover Insurance) Act 1993. The WorkCover system has comprised the following reforms:&lt;BR /&gt;limiting eligibility for benefits&lt;BR /&gt;refocussing the benefit structure on the basis of incapacity&lt;BR /&gt;introduction of a work-based occupational rehabilitation program&lt;BR /&gt;increased focus on dispute resolution through conciliation rather than legal arbitration&lt;BR /&gt;restriction of common law damages to serious injury&lt;BR /&gt;restoring employer liability for workers' compensation costs&lt;BR /&gt;requiring employers to insure against their liability with licensed  insurance companies in a competitive market&lt;BR /&gt;replacement of the levy system with an experience-rated premium system, where an employers premium is directly calculated on the basis of workplace claims performance&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The WorkCover Scheme moved even further away from the object of compensation alone. Eligibility criteria for compensation have become tightened and disputed claims have became more difficult to appeal compared with the previous scheme.  The new scheme also has a less "social" objective, in that it aims to "minimise the burden on Victorian businesses ... to reduce the cost to the Victorian community of accident compensation".&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In effect the Government's role moved away from the direct provision of services to the regulation of the providers of workers' compensation services. The Victorian WorkCover Authority (VA 3081) began operations on 1 December 1992 as the regulatory body responsible for the management of the new scheme. The Authority is the successor to the Accident Compensation Commission, the WorkCare Appeals Board and the Victorian Accident Rehabilitation Council. The Authority also assumed those responsibilities of the former Occupational Health and Safety Authority that related to workplace risk management. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The objectives of the Authority are to:&lt;BR /&gt;manage the accident compensation scheme as effectively and efficiently and economically as is possible; &lt;BR /&gt;administer the Accident Compensation Act, the Workers Compensation Act 1958 and any other relevant Act; &lt;BR /&gt;assist employers and workers in achieving healthy and safe working environments; &lt;BR /&gt;promote the effective rehabilitation of injured workers and their early return to work; &lt;BR /&gt;encourage the provision of suitable employment opportunities to workers who have been injured; &lt;BR /&gt;ensure that appropriate compensation is paid to injured workers in the most socially and economically appropriate manner and as expeditiously as possible.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Accident Compensation Tribunal was abolished and responsibility for legal arbitration was transferred to one of three agencies - the County Court, Magistrates Court, or Administrative Appeals Tribunal - depending on the nature of the dispute. The WorkCare Appeals Board was abolished and the role of dispute resolution has been given to the WorkCover Conciliation Service.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The WorkCover and Executive Support Unit of the Department of Business and Employment (VA 3096) ... truncated</description>

       <description type="full">Background

The Liquor Control Act 1968 (No.7695) came into operation on 1 July 1968 on which date the Liquor Control Commission was constituted.  This Act incorporated a number of recommendations of the Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Sale, Supply, Disposal or Consumption of Liquor in Victoria which commenced in 1963. It marked the end of the system of Licensing Magistrates and Licensing Courts which had operated for over 100 years.  The Commission took over the functions previously exercised by the Victorian Licensing Court and the Licences Reduction Board 

The Licensing Court of three members was replaced by the Liquor Control Commission of four members, the chairman being a County Court Judge with a tenure of 7 years.  This practice was discontinued in 1976 as a result of the Liquor Control (Chairman) Act 1975 (No.8761) enacted on 18 November 1975 and proclaimed on 4 December 1975.  The change meant that the chairman could be a "judicial member" and could retain office until the age of 72 years.

The object of the Act was to ensure the orderly and continuous improvement in, and the development of, facilities for the supply of accommodation, meals and liquor to the public.  The Commission was responsible for establishing standards in these areas and ensuring that they were met.  It also had the authority to issue or cancel licences.  In addition the Act established a new provision whereby the Commission could suspend a licence for a period of time.

Numerous alterations were made in the licensing law and practice of the State, the 1968 Act completely re-writing the law.  All fees taken under the Act and all fines, penalties, forfeitures, and moneys incurred or accruing under it were paid into the Licensing Fund set up under the Licensing Act 1958 (No.6293). 

The power to increase or decrease the number of licenses issued in certain areas was also afforded to the Commission. Determinations in this respect were usually made on the basis of recommendations from local councils.  A completely new code of compensation was set out under the new Act with payments made from the Licensing Fund.

The system of Licensing Inspectors continued, the duties of inspecting premises and enforcing the provisions of the Act being undertaken by nominated members of the police force not below the rank of sub-inspector.

Cessation of the Commission

From 1968 to 1988 when the Commission was replaced by the Liquor Licensing Commission several new types of licences were introduced but the system of registration of licensing remained basically the same.  In October 1984 Dr J.P. Nieuwenhuysen undertook a comprehensive review which concluded that licensing practice in Victoria was restrictive and outdated and did not meet the demands imposed by recent social changes. The general thrust of the report was that the Act under which the licensing laws of Victoria were administered was outdated and cumbersome.  New social and economic developments  associated with liquor licensing had been restricted by the antiquated nature of the law.


Three basic changes in liquor policy were suggested:

   	greater use of instruments outside and within a licensing Act, especially tailored to counter problems of alcohol misuse
   	a less economically and otherwise intrusive and overlapping licensing Act, with greater flexibility for the business of licence holders
   	administrative reform of liquor licensing and a clear separation of judicial and administrative functions.

In 1987 the Liquor Control Act was passed and incorporated many of the report's recommendations.

The object of the Act was to respond to community interest by:

   	promoting economic and social growth in Victoria by encouraging the proper development of the liquor, hospitality and related industries
   	facilitating the development of a diversity of licensed facilities  reflecting consumer demand
   	providing adequate controls over the sale, disposal and consumption of liquor

The Liquor Licensing Commission came into operation as the successor to the Liquor Control Commission on 3 May 1988.  Unlike the previous agency it was not a quasi-judicial body but represented a less formal approach to the control of the sale, supply, and consumption of liquor. The Act provided that the new Commission should consist of a Commissioner, a Deputy Commissioner, (both of whom must be legal practitioners of not less than five years standing) and one or more Assistant Commissioners.  The legislation also made provision for the appointment of a Chief Executive Officer (s.35), a Registrar and licensing fund assessors and other officers and employees as might be necessary (s.45).

The Commission was required to receive, process, and grant or refuse            
   	applications for new licences or permits
   	transfers of existing licences
   	suspension or cancellation of a licence or permit
   	extended hours permits
   	consideration of objections to licence applications through preliminary conferences and, failing resolution, through determinations following hearings.

It was the role of the Commission to :

   	assess and collect licensing fees
   	under the Planning and Environment Act 1987 to act as a referral authority with respect to any question that arises under a planning scheme relating to premises where a liquor licence may be sought
   	to disseminate information regarding the operation of the Liquor Control Act to prospective applicants and the general public.

The primary function of the members of the Commission was to make decisions in accordance with the Act on applications put before them and to act as the referral authority under the Planning and Environment Act.  The administration is the joint responsibility of the Chief Executive Officer and the Registrar.

Further Change

With the passing of the Liquor Control Reform Act 1998 (No 94/1998) the Liquor Licensing Commission was abolished.  This legislation was the result of a review of the Liquor Control Act 1997 against national competition policy principles.  The goals of the legislation were to establish a framework for the sale of liquor that contributed to the minimisation of harm whilst facilitating the development of the industry and meeting community expectations regarding the availability and appropriate opportunities for the consumption of liquor.

The Commission was replaced by a Director of Liquor Licensing to be appointed by the Governor in Council.  The Director was to be responsible for the administration of the Act with the power to determine applications for licences and permits in a timely and accurate fashion.  Liquor licensing (as Liquor Licensing Victoria) operates as part of the small business portfolio situated in the Department of State Development and later the Department of State and Regional Development.

A Liquor Licensing Panel, with the number of members to be determined by the Minister was established to consider the merits of objections against licence applications referred to it by the Director and to provide a recommendation to the Director as to whether the application should be granted.  Further rights of appeal to the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal were provided for in the Act.

The option for areas to remain dry after a poll conducted by local municipalities remained as did the system of licensing inspectors.  Inspectors were to be appointed by the Chief Commissioner of Police from members of the police force of the rank of inspector or above.  Police retained the right to issue infringement notices for breaches of the Act and to take proceedings in a Magistrates Court and/or before the Victorian Civil and Administrative tribunal.

The Act also established the Co-ordinating Council on Control of Liquor Abuse.  The fifteen members of the Council were to be made up of persons representing the Minister responsible for the administration of specific Acts and persons with expertise and knowledge in specified areas, all to be nominated by the Minister and appointed by the Governor in Council.  The Councils function is to advise the Minister on the problems of alcohol abuse and other matters as referred by the Minister.</description>

The Snob's Creek Freshwater Fisheries Research Station and Hatchery was established in 1946. In 1947 the Port Phillip Bay fisheries were studied to encourage the commercial marine fishing industry.

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Under the Passengers Act 1852 ships masters were required to keep accurate passenger lists which were verified before the ship was cleared by customs and passengers could go ashore. Prior to 1852 there was no legal requirement to submit passenger lists.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Monitoring immigrant arrivals remained a State responsibility until 1923.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Ports and Harbours Branch of the Department of Trade and Customs (VA 606) was responsible throughout most of the nineteenth century.  From 1900 to 1923 responsibility continued to be exercised by the Ports and Harbours Branch, which had been transferred to the Public Works Department (VA 669) following federation and the assumption of the customs function by the Commonwealth. The monitoring of arrivals became a Commonwealth (VRG 87) function from October 1923 when regulations were passed bringing into effect Part V of the Commonwealth Navigation Act 1912.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Work on the construction of the Alfred Graving Dock commenced in 1864. No expense was spared in its construction and it represented the greatest single work undertaken by the Victorian Government since separation from New South Wales.  When completed the dock allowed for effective underwater repairs to damaged ships to be undertaken in Victoria and it was then no longer necessary for ships to go to Sydney for such repairs.  The Dock was constructed under the supervision of the Public Works Department.  The dock's memorial stone was laid by Prince Alfred Duke of Edinburgh and in 1874 the first vessel entered the dock.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1913 the Alfred Graving Dock was taken over by the State Shipbuilding Yards and in 1917 the yards were acquired by the Commonwealth Government.  In 1924 the dock was purchased by the Melbourne Harbor Trust who remained in control until 1942 when it was acquired by the Royal Australian Navy and administered as part of the Williamstown Naval Dockyard.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Marine Board of Victoria was established by the Marine Board Act 1887 and commenced operations on 20 December 1888, being the date of the first meeting of the Board as proclaimed in the Government Gazette.  It assumed all functions previously exercised by the Pilot Board of Victoria.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Marine Board of Victoria has been responsible for:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;   	mercantile marine matters including standards of marine safety and shipping registration&lt;BR /&gt;   	certification of pilots, ships masters, mates and engineers&lt;BR /&gt;   	Port Phillip Pilot Service&lt;BR /&gt;   	instituting investigations by the Court of Marine Inquiry.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;With the proclamation of certain sections of the Commonwealth Navigation Act on 1 October 1923, the Commonwealth became responsible for the control of foreign-going and interstate shipping and the Marine Board staff of engineers, surveyors, shipwrights, inspectors of shipping and clerical staff were transferred to the Federal Navigation Department.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;For the period 1923 to 1926, the Commonwealth acted as an agent for the State and carried out the residual functions of the Board, namely:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;   	control of the Port Phillip Pilot Service&lt;BR /&gt;   	control of intra-state shipping and&lt;BR /&gt;   	licensing of motor boats.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;It had been intended that the Pilot Service would also come under Commonwealth control, but the relevant sections of the Navigation Act were never proclaimed.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1927 the Marine Board was effectively re-established under the control of the Minister for Public Works and the Commonwealth ceased to act as an agent for the State.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Marine Board was reconstituted under the Marine Act 1988 although its functions remain relatively the same.  Its objectives are to:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;facilitate efficient and safe operation of vessels&lt;BR /&gt;facilitate navigation safety&lt;BR /&gt;improve community awareness of boating safety&lt;BR /&gt;improve and simplify vessel registration and operating requirements&lt;BR /&gt;be responsible for ensuring an effective response to oil pollution incidents.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Early History to 1857&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Prior to the 1850's neither the population nor the extent of internal trade in the colony had warranted the construction of railways.  In 1853, following the dramatic increase in population which accompanied the discovery of gold, several  Acts providing for the incorporation of  railway companies were passed.  Each company was to be responsible for the construction and maintenance of particular railway lines.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Difficulties experienced by the  companies led the Government to question whether it was appropriate for the responsibility for establishing the network of railway communication required by the Colony to be vested in  companies.  A Commission reported on 26 September 1854 that the construction of railways on a grand scale should be adopted and that such undertakings should be carried out by the Government.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Subsequently a Select Committee authorised the Surveyor General (VA 2921) to undertake surveys to determine the most suitable path for proposed main trunk railway lines.  Surveying of the proposed lines appears to have begun in 1855.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In March 1856 the Government made its first purchase of a  railway company, the Melbourne, Mt Alexander and Murray River Railway Company.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The appointment on 5 May 1856 of George Darbyshire as Engineer-in-Chief and Surveyor to 'Victorian Railways' marked the establishment of a sub-department of railways within the Surveyor General's Department. From November 1857 the railways sub-department became a branch of the Department of Crown Lands and Survey.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Board of Land and Works (1857  1884)&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;From 1857 the Board of Land and Works (VA 744) assumed responsibility for all railways matters including railway construction and management;  supervision and purchase of  railway companies;  power to regulate fares and tolls;  and control over purchase, use and sale of property and equipment for railway purposes. (Refer to the Main Trunk Line Act 1857 (No.35) (Vic.), Railway Loan Act 1857 (No.36) (Vic.), Railway Act 1857 (No.38) (Vic.), Railway Supervision Act 1857 (No. 40) (Vic.) and the Public Works Act 1865 (No.289) (Vic.))&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The first Commissioner of Railways was appointed on 26 November 1860 assuming ministerial responsibility for railways from the Commissioner of Public Works (VA 2877). On 30 December 1861 a Commissioner of Railways and Roads succeeded the Commissioner of Railways. When the Board of Land and Works met to determine railway matters the Vice-President of the Board presided.  Initially there was only one Vice-President who was also the Commissioner of Public Works.  However on 23 January 1862, the Commissioner of Railways and Roads was appointed as a second Vice-President of the Board, and thereafter presided over railway matters. From 1880 the Commissioner of Railways presided over such meetings.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Department of Railways I (1858 to 1871)&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The first Department of Railways (VA 2877) emerged in January 1858, subject to the statutory control of the Board of Land and Works (VA 744). The Board of Land and Works' statutory responsibility involved deciding matters of dispute and policy, making regulations and generally authorising the business and finances of the Department.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The establishment of a Department of Railways reflected the Government's increased responsibility under legislation for the co-ordination and development of the State's railways.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In particular the Main Trunk Line Act 1857 authorised the State to construct main trunk lines of railway from Melbourne to the Murray River and from Geelong to Ballarat.  The Railway Loan Act 1857 authorised the raising of money by debentures for the construction of certain railways.  The Railway Act 1857 provided for the general construction of railways within the State.  The Railway Supervision Act 1857 authorised the State's Railway Authority to inspect and supervise the operations of  railway companies for the protection of railway passengers.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Also, in the  Acts incorporating the various joint stock railway companies provision was made for the Government to purchase the rights and property of the company after a certain time period. By the 1870s most  companies had been taken over by the Government.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Department of Railways and Roads (1871 to 1877)&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Although a Commissioner of Railways and Roads had been appointed on 30 December 1861, railways, roads and bridges were dealt with by separate Departments, both under the authority of the Board of Land and Works (VA 744) until 26 April 1871.  On this date John Steavenson, who was the Assistant Commissioner of Roads and Bridges, was also appointed to the position of Secretary to the Railways Department and henceforth the two Departments appear to have been jointly administered.  &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;From the Department of Railways the Department of Railways and Roads  (VA 2875) assumed responsibility for:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;   	railway construction and maintenance; &lt;BR /&gt;   	supervision of  railway companies and; &lt;BR /&gt;   	survey of proposed lines of railway.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;During the period of combined administration, the Board of Land and Works continued to exercise its responsibility for authorising the business of the Department and for determining policy and regulations.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1872 the Department began to build and repair rolling stock.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Department of Railways II (1877 to 1884)&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;On 1 September 1877 the Governor-in-Council severed the administration of matters relating to roads and bridges from the Department of Railways and Roads.  Railways matters were subsequently assumed by a new Department of Railways II (VA 2965).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Over the next few years significant internal administrative changes took place as responsible positions were created, abolished and revived in relatively short time periods.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Department initially reported to the Commissioner of Railways and Roads until 5 March 1880, and thereafter to the Commissioner of Railways.  By 1878 the government had purchased the Melbourne and Hobson's Bay United Railway Company - the last of the major  railway companies - although it appears that minor railway lines could still be constructed ly.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;To carry out its main functions of the survey, construction and maintenance of railway lines and the management of the State's railway service, the Department of Railways on 12 July 1882 consisted of the following branches:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;   	Administration Branch, responsible for the general supervision and administration of the whole of the railway service.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;   	Engineer-in-Chief's Branch, responsible for the supervision of the  survey and construction of all lines.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;   	Engineer for Existing Lines Branch, responsible for the supervision and maintenance of all constructed railways.&lt;BR /&gt;	&lt;BR /&gt;   	Traffic Branch, responsible for the management of railway traffic including passengers, goods and live-stock.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;   	Locomotive Branch, concerned with general railway practice and requirements.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;   	Telegraph Branch, responsible for the supervision of telegraph and signalling matters, clocks and watches.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;At all times the business of the Department was subject to the authority of the Board of Land and Works (VA 744).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Appointment of Victorian Railways Commissioners 1883&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;On 1 November 1883 assent was given to the Victorian Railways Commissioners Act 1883, (No.767) (Vic.) to make better provision for the construction, maintenance and management of the state railways.  Although the provisions concerning the appointment of Commissioners were given immediate effect, the remaining provisions of the Act were not to become operative until 1st February 1884.  The Act provided for the transfer of statutory responsibility for the state's railways from the Board of Land and Works (VA 744) to the newly appointed Victorian Railways Commissioners.  The Commissioners, constituted as a statutory body, were to report directly to the minister responsible for railways and could appoint staff to assist in the execution of the Act.  The staff of the Department of Railways thereafter became subject to the authority of the Commissioners and became commonly known as 'Victorian Railways' (although this title had been used interchangeably with Department of Railways since the first appointment of staff in 1856).  It is not evident that any major changes were made to the Department's operation as a result of this rearrangement, however, Victorian Railways has been registered as a separate agency (VA 2876).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Board of Land and Works thereafter effectively ceased to exercise responsibility for railways matters and it appears that the Minister responsible for Railways ceased to be, ex officio, a Vice-President of the Board.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The functions for which Victorian Railways assumed responsibility included:&lt;BR /&gt;   	survey and construction of new lines of railway&lt;BR /&gt;   	supervision and maintenance of existing lines &lt;BR /&gt;   	management of railway traffic including passengers, goods and livestock&lt;BR /&gt;   	superintendence of railway services&lt;BR /&gt;   	determining by-laws, rules and regulations concerning railway operations&lt;BR /&gt;   	construction and repair of rolling stock.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Railways Act 1891&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1891 the Parliamentary Standing Committee for Railways recommended that construction of railways be separated from their management. The Railways Act (Amendment Act) 1891, (No. 1250) (Vic.) which became operative from 1 January 1892, provided for the Board of Land and Works (VA 744) to resume responsibility for the survey, construction and completion of all lines of railway. The agency responsible for railway construction subsequently became known as the Railway Construction Branch, Board of Land and Works. The 1891 Act provided that the officers and employees of the Engineer-in -Chief's Branch of Victorian Railways be transferred to the employment of the Board of Land and Works.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Act authorised the Board to accept contracts for works to be undertaken and determined that once a line became completed the responsibility of the Board would cease and responsibility would be assumed by the Victorian Railways Commissioners.  The Commissioners retained responsibility for maintenance and supervision of completed lines of railway as well as the general management of railway traffic. This included the management of goods, livestock and passengers, safety measures, the regulation of fares, the management of appropriated funds, as well as staff issues such as the allocation of salaries and employee compensation.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The 1891 Act also provided for the Minister of Railways to be, ex-officio, a Vice-President of the Board of Land and Works and tightened ministerial control over the Victorian Railways Commissioners - a return to the situation that had existed until 1883.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Developments 1920s &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Railway refreshment services, complimentary road motor passenger and goods services were also developed during the 1920s. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Appointment of Minister of Transport 1934&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1934 responsibility for the State's railway services was transferred from the Minister of Railways to a new Minister of Transport.  This appointment reflected a move from the 1920s toward greater co-ordination of transport matters, especially rail and road services.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Establishment of Railway Construction Board 1964&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Under the provisions of the Public Lands and Works Act 1964 (No.7228) (Vic.) the Board of Land and Works was dissolved and a Railway Construction Board (VA 691) was established on 1 January 1965, assuming responsibility for railwa... truncated</description>

       <description type="full">Background

 A Veterinary Inspector appears to have been first appointed in the Department of Public Health on 10 June 1896 (Public Service Lists). By 1905 the duties of the Veterinary Inspector are listed as inquiry "into the healthiness of dairy cattle and into sanitary circumstances of dairies, slaughter-houses and butcher shops and into the wholesomeness of meat supplies" (Public Service Lists). It is evident that the sale of milk and butter was regulated at this time under the Health Act.

The Milk and Dairy Supervision Act 1905 (No.2011) provided for a greater regulation of milk, butter and cheese production and marketing. The Minister of Agriculture was vested with responsibility for administration of the Act by extension through local councils (see VRG 12) where necessary. A series of later Acts led to licensing and supervision of all types of milk, butter and cheese producers, and ultimately of many retailers.  In many cases administration of these Acts was carried out through some form of departmental committee or statutory authority. From 22 January 1906 the Chief Veterinary Inspector became part of the Agriculture portfolio.

In 1919 a grant was made to the University of Melbourne for veterinary research which continued for many years.  

The Agricultural portfolio also included the Veterinary Board of Victoria which registers veterinary surgeons working in Victoria.

The Department of Agriculture operated through a divisional structure. The Division of Animal Health formed early in 1966 from the former Livestock Division. The Division assumed responsibility for developing veterinary diagnostic services. 

As at 1994 the Veterinary Services section of the Animal Standards Branch is currently responsible for the prevention, investigation, diagnosis and control of disease and chemical residues in stock and diseases transmissible from animals to humans, the management of Victoria's contribution to the national brucellosis and tuberculosis eradication campaign and for the investigation of cruelty to farm animals.</description>

The Protection of Animals Act 1881 (45 Vic.,No.712), which was to be read and construed as one with Part II of the Police Offences Act 1865, prohibited cruelty towards animals.

The Protection of Animals Act 1966 (No.7432) provided for the re-enactment with amendments of Division 2 of Part II of the Police Offences Act 1958. The Act made it an offence to undertake acts of cruelty towards animals.

The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1968 provided for the retrospective incorporation of the Society (previously known as the Victorian Society for the Protection of Animals) under the Hospitals and Charities Act. From 1871 to 1895 the Society was an unincorporated association. Since 1895 the Society had been incorporated although doubts had arisen as to the legal existence, membership and control of the Society.

The Protection of Animals Regulations 1974 were initially administered by the Chief Secretary's Department (Statutory Rules 436/1974).

In 1980 the Protection of Animals Regulations 1974 were listed as a responsibility of the Fisheries and Wildlife Division of the Ministry for Conservation (Victorian Government Directory 1980).

By February 1981 the Minister of Agriculture had assumed responsibility for the Protection of Animals Act 1966 (Government Gazette No.16 1981).

The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1986 represented a re-enactment and updating of the Protection of Animals Act 1966. The 1986 Act enables Codes of Practice to be made in respect of any animal and provides stricter and more effective measures to protect animals from acts of cruelty. It also provides more stringent controls over scientific experiments on animals and introduces a comprehensive scheme of supervision of animal experimentation.</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Each new rural financing scheme has carried forward the servicing of debts incurred under its predecessor.  There has been a gradual broadening also of the focus, so that what began as a scheme for assisting debt-ridden farmers in the Depression has come to comprehend financing of many of the activities included under the function of regional development.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The first such agency was the Farmers Relief Board established under the provisions of the Unemployed Occupiers and Farmers Relief Act 1931.  In 1935 this was replaced by the Farmers Debts Adjustments Board established under the Farmers Debts Adjustment Act 1935.  This Board consisted of three members appointed by the Governor in Council with the chairman being a person experienced in legal and business matters.  One other member was to have practical farming experience and the other to have commercial experience.  Farmers were to be able to apply for an adjustment of debts to a local conciliation officer.  If satisfied that the application was a valid one a stay order would be issued suspending creditors rights to enable a plan of debt adjustment to be formulated, registered with the Board and carried out.  The Board had the power to make recommendation to the Closer Settlement Commission for advances to the farmer to enable farming operations to be carried on.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;With the passing of the Rural Finance Corporation Act 1949 this agency was superseded by the Rural Finance Corporation I..  The Corporation consisted of three members appointed by the Governor in council with one having to have knowledge and experience in business finance and another knowledge of and experience in primary production.  The Corporation was able to raise money by application to the Public Account, by the issuing of debentures or inscribed stock or from interest charged on loans and other fees and charges.  The Corporation was authorised to make loans to persons or bodies carrying on primary industry, for secondary industry in non-metropolitan areas and for the co-operative marketing or manufacture of rural products.  As well, the Corporation took on the debt adjustment functions of the Farmers Debt Adjustment Board.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1962, the functions of the Rural Finance Corporation were combined with those of the Soldier Settlement Corporation (VA 2270) by the provisions of the Rural Finance and Settlement Commission Act 1961.  This Commission had two branches.  The Settlement Branch administered  activities under the Soldier Settlement Act 1958 and the Land Settlement Act 1959.  The Finance Branch handled matters previously dealt with by the Rural Finance Corporation.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Rural Finance Commission was established in 1977 by the Rural Finance and Settlement Commission (Amendment) Act and was empowered to make loans to primary industry and country secondary industry.  As an agent of the treasurer it administered a number of schemes including the Commonwealth / State Rural Adjustment Schemes and Natural Disaster Lending. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Rural Finance Corporation was established on 1 July 1988 under the Rural Finance Act 1988 (No.44).  Its charter is to promote and support rural industries and economic growth in regional Victoria. The responsibilities of the Rural Finance Corporation, as set down by its establishing Act are:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;   	to provide financial and other services to rural industries&lt;BR /&gt;   	on the direction of the Treasurer, to administer State and Commonwealth schemes of assistance or other schemes&lt;BR /&gt;   	to administer the remaining purchase leases, mortgages, contracts of sale and other interests created under the Land Settlement Act 1959 (No.6534) and the Soldier Settlement Act 1958 (No.6373)&lt;BR /&gt;   	to co-ordinate financial resources for investment in rural industries&lt;BR /&gt;   	to facilitate an increase in the availability of finance to persons engaged in or seeking to establish rural industry&lt;BR /&gt;   	to provide services and advice to government with regard to rural industries and rural affairs&lt;BR /&gt;   	where appropriate to undertake promotional activities to further the objectives of the Rural Finance Act 1988 (No.44).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In order to fulfil its functions the Corporation is able to acquire and &lt;BR /&gt;dispose of property and provide or arrange loans for commercial and rural purposes.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In November 1988 most of the assets and liabilities of the Victorian Economic Development Corporation (VA 1109) were transferred to the Rural Finance Corporation after the V.E.D.C. was wound down.  All current commercial and rural loan arrangements established by the V.E.D.C. were administered by the Rural Finance Corporation.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Corporation is administered by a Board of Management appointed by the Governor-In-Council and has a Chief Executive Officer appointed by the Board.&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1917 the Discharged Soldiers' Settlement Act (No.2916) made provision for the Lands Purchase and Management Board, subsequently the Closer Settlement Board (VA 2266), to reserve areas for selection by discharged soldiers under the provisions of the Closer Settlement Act (No.2629).  In addition, the Act conferred upon the Board the power to make special provisions for the settlement of discharged soldiers.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Under the same legislation the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission (VA 723), and thus the Minister of Water Supply, acquired control of soldier settlement on irrigable lands until 1933 when all land settlement functions passed to the Closer Settlement Commission (VA 2268).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Responsibility for soldier settlement functions continued in the closer settlement agencies, the Closer Settlement Board (VA 2266) and the Closer Settlement Commission (VA 2268), until 1938 when direct control of the administration of all land settlement functions returned to the Department of Crown Lands and Survey (VA 538).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1946 the Soldier Settlement Commission (VA 2270) was established under the auspices of the State/Commonwealth Agreement for the repatriation of returned servicemen/women (Act No.5170).  The Commission reported to the Commissioner of Crown Lands and Survey (VRG 18) and subsequently to the Minister of Soldier Settlement (VRG 18).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Under s.14 of the Act the Commission was empowered to appoint its own employees who were not subject to the provisions of the Public Service Act.  However s.15 enabled the Commission to make use of the services of the officers of the Department of Crown Lands and Survey (VA 538).  When this occurred, departmental expenses were recouped from the Soldier Settlement Account (see Annual Report 1966).  Other statutory authorities, including the Housing Commission (VA 508), Country Roads Board (VA 722) and State Rivers and Water Supply Commission (VA 723) were empowered to undertake work for the Soldier Settlement Commission under s.11 (2) of the Soldier Settlement Act 1946.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1962 the Rural Finance and Settlement Commission (VA 2273) was established and assumed responsibility for the functions of the former Soldier Settlement Commission and the former Rural Finance Corporation (VA 2272).  In 1977 the Rural Finance and Settlement Commission (VA 2273) became the Rural Finance Commission (VA 1073) with continued responsibility for the administration of soldier settlement legislation.  In 1983 the Rural Finance Commission (VA 1073) became the responsibility of the Minister for Agriculture (VRG 34).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;	The Rural Finance Corporation was established on 1 July 1988 under the Rural Finance Act 1988 (No.44).  The Corporation is the successor agency to the Rural Finance Commission (VA 1073) which operated with similar objectives between 1977 and 1988.  It had as one of its functions the administration of the remaining purchase leases, mortgages, contracts of sale and other interests created under the Land Settlement Act 1959 (No.6534) and the Soldier Settlement Act 1958 (No.6373)&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background

School attendance was first made mandatory in Victoria in 1873. Section 13 of the Education Act 1872 (No.447) provided that children between the ages of six and fifteen years must attend school for a period of sixty days in each half year unless there was some reasonable excuse for their not doing so. The definition of reasonable excuse included that the child was under efficient instruction in some other manner;  that the child had been educated to the required standard;  that the child was prevented from attending school by illness, fear of infection, temporary or permanent infirmity or unavoidable cause or that there was no State school within two miles of the childs residence.

Section 14 of the Act provided that parents who neglected to send their children to school could be summoned before a Justice, convicted and fined and in default of payment, imprisoned for a maximum of seven days.

The Education Act Amendment Act 1876 (No. 541), section 7, provided for a biennial, mandatory census of school age children. Parents were required to complete a return giving the name, gender, age and place of instruction of each school age child. A consolidated roll was then prepared for each school district.

Section 48 of the Education Act 1910 (No. 2301) prohibited the employment of children during school hours unless they had been granted a legal exemption on the grounds of the illness or poverty of their parents. It also prohibited the employment of children before school if such employment would make them unfit for school work.

From 1873 to 1971, the Education Department (VA 714), was responsible for the regulation of school attendance. In 1971 the Social Welfare Department (VA 946) was established under the provisions of the Social Welfare Act 1970 (No. 8089). Section 9 of that Act transferred responsibility for the administration of the sections of the Education Act 1958 governing school attendance from the Minister for Education to the Minister for Social Welfare.

In 1978 the relevant sections of the Education Act were repealed by section 28 of the Community Welfare Services Act (No. 9248) and new provisions were inserted in the Social Welfare Act 1970. The new provisions amplified but did not fundamentally change the former requirements. In 1987 responsibility for the regulation of school attendance was returned to the Minister of Education by an amendment to the Administration of Acts General Order of 13 July 1987.

The agencies responsible for the regulation of school attendance have used a mix of strategies to achieve their ends. These have included the regulation of the employment of children, the provision of counselling and sometimes financial assistance to parents and students, the provision of professional advice and treatment of children by the School Medical Service and later the staff of the Psychology and Guidance Branch and the sanction of prosecution of offending parents.

District Attendance Officers were employed by the Education Department and from 1971, the Social Welfare Department. They visited schools, inspected rolls, visited the parents of children who were frequently absent from school without authorisation to ascertain the reasons for the absences and to seek to resolve the problem. In some cases they took recalcitrant parents to court.

In 1933 the School Medical Service reported that it was receiving an increasing number of attendance case referrals relating to children who were truants, children who had been absent from school on grounds of illness, children whose attendance was habitually irregular and children who seemed unable to progress. The children were given a medical examination and their abilities were assessed. Medical treatment and advice regarding special educational facilities and training were provided. The 1943/1944 Annual Report included a report of ...an exhaustive survey of one industrial suburb, with particular attention to physical defects and to school and environmental maladjustments in truants. It was considered that this inquiry would result not only in the adoption of immediate remedial measures in individual cases, but also in comprehensive preventive recommendations for future control of the problems of truancy...

In 1974 the Social Welfare Department reported ...significant changing trends in community attitudes towards compulsory education and the resultant Departmental approaches to resolving the problems of young truants.... They noted the rising number of school exemptions being granted to students and the diminishing number of prosecutions of parents. The Department acknowledged that in some cases insistence on attendance was not in the best interests of either the child or the school. The attendance statistics for 1973-4 showed that the reasons for granting school exemptions were the financial circumstances or illness of parents, behaviour problems or lack of progress of the child and requests for permission to enter business college or employment.

As at 1996 the regulation of attendance is primarily the responsibility of individual schools. In larger secondary schools student welfare co-ordinators work with students and parents to resolve truancy problems and special programs are devised to assist students. In primary schools responsibility is usually exercised by the Principal. In some instances cases are referred to regional Guidance Officers or social workers. Since c.1993 the Department has ceased to employ regional attendance officers and prosecution of parents is rare. The General Manager of each region is ultimately responsible for the approval of alternative educational arrangements for children and for the granting of exemptions to children under the statutory age of fifteen.</description>

       <description type="full">Background

The Master and Apprentice Act and the Employers and Employees Act extended the English common law on apprenticeship to Victoria and made certain additional provisions. The Factories and Shops Acts introduced further additional provisions, among other things providing for the determination by Wages Boards of conditions of employment applicable to apprentices, and such provisions were incorporated in the Labour and Industry Act 1953. 

The Apprenticeship Act 1927 (No.3546), operative from 8 May 1928, provided for the appointment of an Apprenticeship Commission (VA 899) to administer the Act. The members of the Commission represented the Chamber of Manufacturers and the Trades Hall Council. The first meeting of the Commission was held on 27 July 1928.  

Matters to be dealt with by the Commission included:

- proclamation of apprenticeship trade
- encouragement of apprenticeship in proclaimed trades
- determination of prepatory educational and minimum age standards for apprenticeship  prescribing conditions of apprenticeship
- general supervision over the practical and theoretical training of apprentices
- prescribing standards of efficiency and awarding certificates upon completion of the apprenticeship
- ensuring all apprentices were properly indentured and registered
- deciding questions of difference arising between employers and apprentices.

In the early stages the activities of the Commission were confined mainly to consideration of general lines of policy to be pursued, carrying out investigations in connection with trades suitable for proclamation as apprenticeship trades and establishing the general regulations which formed the basis of the scheme for apprenticeship trades.

The first trades proclaimed as apprenticeship trades under the Act were those relating to Plumbing and Gasfitting (proclaimed on 10 October 1928).  Following the proclamation a Trade Committee, consisting of three representatives of the Employers and three representatives of the Employees' organisations concerned was appointed to confer with the Commission in the preparation of draft regulations and to co-operate with the Commission in the supervision and the administration of the Act.

Trade Committees appointed following the proclamation of trades as apprenticeship trades include the following:

- Plumbing and Gasfitting (Metropolitan District), Dated 10/10/1928
- Carpentry and Joinery (Metropolitan District), Dated 28/11/1928

In accordance with the provisions of the Act, the Apprenticeship Commission was assisted by special Advisory Committees which were set up in country areas to advise the commission on local matters pertaining to apprenticeship.  These Advisory Committees performed somewhat similar functions to those performed by Trade Committees and were of greater assistance, particularly where varying local conditions affected circumstances.

Early proclamation of apprenticeship trades applied only to the Metropolitan District.  The first proclamation outside the Metropolitan District was made in 1938 (extending the area of proclamation of the Plumbing and Gasfitting Trades to Ballarat and Geelong). Since then the area of proclamation of most of the major apprenticeship trades has been extended to cover the whole State.

Although most apprentices were employed pursuant to the Apprenticeship Acts, others were employed subject to the conditions determined by the relevant Wages Boards under the Factories and Shops Acts, subsequently Labour and Industry Act 1953, which did not require the registration of indentures and which allowed for the employment of unapprenticed trainees (known as improvers).

Apprenticeship remained for many years the principle means for training skilled tradespeople in Victoria.

In 1969 the Master and Apprentice Act was repealed. The Apprenticeship Amendment Act 1971 (No.8174), operative from 1 January 1972, repealed those sections of the Employers and Employees Act which related to apprenticeship. The Labour and Industry (Amendment) Act 1971 (No.8211) repealed the apprenticeship provisions of the Labour and Industry Act. The Statute Law on apprenticeship was therefore consolidated into the Apprenticeship Act following a recommendation of the Commission.

Until the passing of the Apprenticeship Amendment Act 1971 the Apprenticeship Commission only dealt with proclaimed apprenticeship trades (proclaimed trades were prohibited from employing unapprenticed learners). There were also apprentices in non-proclaimed trades. The 1971 Act provided for such trades to be proclaimed while allowing the employment of unapprenticed learners ie. that apprenticeship in the trade is voluntary. This provision was introduced to maintain a uniform policy on apprenticeship matters and to enable the Commission to control the registration of indentures and settle disputes between parties.

The Industrial Training Act 1975 repealed the Apprenticeship Act 1958 (and amending Acts) expanding the notion of industrial training to include "pre-apprenticeship training" and "adult training" courses. Under the provisions of the Act the apprenticeship scheme was also extended into the State government sphere of operation and into the agriculture industry. In addition the legislation provided for the constitution of Industry Advisory Committees with the function of advising the Commission on the skilled manpower requirements of each industry and the measures necessary to correct any likely shortage or surplus of skilled tradesmen in any industry.

The Industrial Training Commission (VA 900) succeeded the Apprenticeship Commission on 2 August 1975, having been established under the Industrial Training Act 1975 to oversee industrial training in Victoria. An Industrial Training Division was established at this time in the Department of Labour and Industry (VA 1027) to provide administrative support to the Commission, to supply information and advice to the public on industrial training, to investigate complaints and to ensure the provisions of the Act were observed. Responsibility for industrial and apprenticeship training was transferred to the Ministry of Employment and Training (VA 704) in December 1980.

The Industrial Relations Act 1979 which come into operation in 1981 amended the Industrial Training Act 1975 by removing the Industrial Training Commission's powers to prepare draft regulations with respect to apprentices' rates of pay, overtime, increments and allowances for tools.

The Industrial Training (Further Amendment) Act 1981 (No.9677) provided for pre-vocational trainees, trainee technicians and tradesmen accreditation. The legislation was designed to utilise the knowledge, ability and experience of representatives of employees, employers and the State government in supervising the training of persons undertaking pre-apprenticeship courses, adult training courses and in co-ordinating training in skilled trades both in technical schools and industry. The Commission was empowered to issue Trade Certificates to persons who had not completed an apprenticeship or period of adult training but who possessed the necessary skills, subject to a trade test, for all trades except those covered by licensing and registration boards or by Commonwealth legislation.

The role of the Industrial Training Commission included:

- reviewing the requirements of the State for skilled tradespeople and technicians
- assessing the availability of skilled persons to meet those requirements
- ensuring the availability of young persons for training in skilled trades and of vacancies for apprentices, pre-apprenticeship trainees, and adult trainees
- recommending measures to increase participation by employers in the training of apprentices
- reporting on the adequacy of training of apprentices in employers' workshops and in technical schools and
- suggesting ways of promoting the apprenticeship system as a means of training skilled tradespeople.

In 1987 the Ministry of Education and Training (VA 1112) assumed responsibility for industrial and apprenticeship training from the Department of Labour II.

The State Training Board (VA 3002) was first established in November 1987 by an Order in Council under the provisions of the Post Secondary Education Act 1978. The purpose was to establish an authority to co-ordinate and administer the Government's training policies and the technical and vocational training services provided by the State. The Order in Council empowered the Board to assume the functions of the Industrial Training Commission and to assist the Technical and Further Education Board (VA 1176). From 1 April 1988 the State Training Board also became responsible for the functions of the Division of Training of the Department of Labour II (VA 2777). 

The State Training Board was reconstituted under the Vocational Education and Training Act 1990. Although the Industrial Training Commission's functions had been assumed by the former State Training Board the Commission was not formally abolished until 1 July 1991 when the provision of the Vocational Education and Training Act 1990 abolishing the Commission (section 95(2)) came into operation.

The State Training Board operates under the following legislation which regulates the State Training System:

- Industrial Training Act, 1975
- Employment and Training Act, 1981
- Post Secondary Education Act, Part III, 1983, as well as the original 1978 provisions of the Post Secondary Education Act.

The State Training System includes:

- Thirty-three TAFE Colleges
- Apprenticeship and traineeship systems
- Industry training network and skills centres located either in TAFE colleges or in  industries and the
- five  hairdressing colleges.

The role of the State Training Board, which is a statutory authority involves:

- planning, development, and administration of vocational training programmes
- the administration of apprenticeships and traineeships
- adult training programmes
- establishment of skill centres and Industry Training Boards.

The State Training Board also exercises powers under delegation from the Victorian Post Secondary Education Commission.  These are:

- endorsing funding submissions from colleges
- approving establishment or amalgamation of College Councils
- approving the expenditure of government funds on courses
- referring courses for investigation to the Accreditation Board and
- recommending regulations.

Early attempts to provide water supplies for rural Victoria were made as a result of a mixture of local initiatives through the establishment of Water Trusts from the 1850's and Government action on the goldfields.  The earliest reticulated supplies were developed in Bendigo (1858-1859), Ballarat (1860-1862) and Geelong (late 1860's).

From 1861 reservoirs were constructed on the goldfields by the Public Works Department (VA 669) for the Board of Land and Works (VA 744);  some were maintained by the Government, others leased to Water Trusts.  The need for legislative control led to the passage of the Waterworks Act in 1865 which gave the Board of Land and Works power to complete and construct water works, to purchase land, levy charges, lease or sell works and provide loans to local Water Trusts (under the Public Loans Act 1865) to complete and construct water works.  The actual administration of these statutory provisions came to be undertaken by the Victorian Water Supply Department (VWSD).

Establishment of the Victorian Water Supply Department

The Victorian Water Supply Department was set up as a sub-department within the Department of Mines (VA 2719) in 1865 and its first Chief Engineer (H.O. Christopherson) appointed on 1 November (Civil Establishment of Victoria 1866, 1867).  By 1867 all Public Works responsibilities for water reservoirs and water supplies to the goldfields had been taken on by the VWSD (Treasurer's Statements of Receipts and Expenditure for 1866 and 1867).  The Chief Engineer's Report to 31 December 1867 to the Minister for Mines and Vice-President of the Board of Lands and Works reported on surveys undertaken of proposed works by Water Trusts and their works-in-progress, land purchases, administration of loans and the works under the direct control of the VWSD - Coliban (Sandhurst-Castlemaine), Geelong and Echuca (Parliamentary Papers 1868).  Control and management of the Coliban and Geelong Schemes continued until they were taken over by the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission (VA 723) in 1905-1906.

Water Conservation Acts 1881-1886

The need for better central regulation and co-ordination of rural water supplies led to an inquiry by a Water Conservancy Board and the subsequent passage of the first attempt at comprehensive legislation, the Water Conservation Act 1881 (subsequently amended between 1883 and 1886 and consolidated 1887).  Its provisions, administered by the VWSD, included the constitution of and appointment of Commissioners for local Waterworks Trusts and Districts, including Urban Districts, their powers and duties, loans and rating, supply and sale of water.

Royal Commission on Water Supply 1884-1885

Continuing dissatisfaction with the situation and the growing requirements of agriculture resulted in the setting up on 23 December 1884  of a Royal Commission on Water Supply with Alfred Deakin as President and Stuart Murray as Secretary.  Its recommendations resulted in the Irrigation Act 1886 and the restructuring of the VWSD (see Further Progress Report to Parliament 31 August 1885).

Irrigation Act 1886, Water Act 1890

The Irrigation Act 1886 vested water rights in surface water in the Crown, made the Minister responsible for promoting efficient storage and use of water resources for mining, manufacturing and industrial use, domestic and stock supply and irrigation, established "national works" and the responsibilities of the Board of Land and Works (VA 744), provided for irrigation and Rural Water Supply Districts and set down requirements for their constitution by the Governor-in-Council (specified boundaries, proposed works, water entitlement, water sources, rates, costs, loans, number of Commissioners), and provided for the issue of pumping leases and licences to construct water works.  The VWSD administered the provisions of the Irrigation Act 1886 (subsequently consolidated with the Water Conservation Acts in the Water Act 1890) and took on operational responsibility for the statutory or lease responsibilities given to the Board of Lands and Works (VA 744) by the Act.  These related to the administration of loans to water and irrigation trusts, surveys of water storage resources and improvement planning, surveying of rivers and streams, boring and exploration for underground water and construction and management of "national works" (ss.124-133 Irrigation Act 1886, ss. 283-291 Water Act 1890).  "National works" were works declared by Act of Parliament to be of state wide significance.  They were constructed and managed under the direct control of the State.  The Chief-Engineer of VWSD was responsible for reporting to the Minister on the financial viability of proposed "national works" (s. 126 Irrigation Act 1886, s. 293 Water Act 1890).

Separation from Department of Mines (VA 2719) 1889

Following the Royal Commission's recommendations on its restructuring, the VWSD became an independent agency in late 1889 (see Victoria Government Gazette 13 December 1889, p.4368 for abolition of position of Secretary of Mines and Water Supply on 12 December 1889).  Stuart Murray (Secretary to the Royal Commission) had become its Chief Engineer in September 1886 (Victoria Government Gazette 10 September 1886 p. 2612) replacing William Heron Steel (also Inspector-General of Public Works).  In January 1890 the Department acquired its own Secretary, H W Meakin (Civil Establishment Return for 31 December 1890 gives 17 January as the appointment date).  At this stage the Department was organised into four Branches - Engineering, Correspondence, Accounts and Country (management of Coliban and Geelong Schemes).


Reamalgamation with Department of Mines 1895

In 1895 the VWSD was amalgamated with the Department of Mines (VA 2719), forming the Department of Mines and Water Supply (Victoria Government Gazette 31 May 1895 p. 1946 as of 22 May 1895).  The VWSD continued to function much as before under Chief Engineer Stuart Murray as a sub-department of the Department of Mines and Water Supply (VA 2720), although its main accounting and audit responsibilities were undertaken by the latter's Accounts Branch.

Abolition 1906-1910

Gradually there was a recognition that there was a need for a single more powerful and independent co-ordinating authority to manage the State's water resources.  Inadequate water conservation, fragmented control, insufficient charges and irregular revenue had led to the failure of many Trusts.  The Water Act of 1905 therefore vested overall responsibility for conservation and distribution of Victoria's rural water supplies for irrigation, industrial and 
urban purposes with the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission (VA 723).  The VWSD's responsibilities relating to Water and Irrigation Trusts, water rights and those operations it carried out for the Board of Lands and Works (VA 744) under ss. 283-291 of the 1890 Act passed to the Commission.  A few legislative provisions were still the responsibility of the Department's Chief-Engineer (eg. reporting on viability of proposed "national works" under s.293 1890 Act), but these were removed by the Water Act 1909 which formally merged the Department and its remaining staff into the Commission (proclaimed 4 January 1910 Victoria Government Gazette 19 January 1910, p 274).  Stuart Murray, while still retaining the position of Chief-Engineer, became one of the first three Commissioners of the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission.  In 1908 he was replaced as Chief-Engineer by Elwood Mead (the first Chairman of the Commission).  The years 1906 to 1909 saw a gradual scaling down of the activities of the VWSD and transfer of its staff to the new Commission.

Establishment of the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission

The State Rivers and Water Supply Commission was established by the Water Act 1905 and the first three Commissioners were appointed in May 1906:  Stuart Murray, George Janson and William Cattanach (Victoria Government Gazette, 16 May 1906).

The establishment of the Commission stemmed from a recognition that there was a need for a single, powerful and independent authority to coordinate and manage the State's rural water resources.  The Water Act 1905 therefore vested overall responsibility for conservation and distribution of Victoria's rural water supplies for irrigation, industrial and urban purposes with the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission.

Responsibilities and Functions

The main responsibilities of the Commission were:

   	 provision of advice about rural water resources and management to the Minister, landowners, and client groups
   	 surveying, gauging and reporting on surface water resources
   	 investigation, construction and management of water supply and drainage schemes for domestic, stock, industry and irrigation purposes
   	 oversight of local water, irrigation, sewerage, drainage and river improvement authorities
   	 flood plain management, flood protection and reclamation schemes
   	 river improvements, stream management and conservation, salinity and water quality control
   	 utilisation and conservation of underground water resources
   	 licensing of diversion of surface and underground waters.

The Commission also acted as the delegated authority of the Environment Protection Authority from 1973 with respect to water pollution in rural areas, and had certain responsibilities relating to soil conservation.  In the periods of closer settlement following the First and Second World Wars, the Commission had responsibilities for a number of settlements in the irrigation areas.  From 1969, under the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission (Special Projects) Act, it was empowered to provide consulting services outside Victoria.

History of Functions: 1905 and 1909 Water Acts

The 1905 Act vested in the Commission statutory responsibility for:

    		surveys of available water resources and planning for their storage and utilisation
    		oversight of local water, sewerage and irrigation authorities, including administration of loans
    		gauging of rivers and streams and reporting on results
    		boring and exploration for underground water
    		ownership and management of proclaimed "national works" (water works of State-wide significance).

The Board of Land and Works (VA 744) continued to have statutory responsibility for construction of "national works", although the actual construction was managed by the Commission.  Statutory responsibility for construction was transferred to the Commission by the Water Act 1909.

Oversight of Local Authorities

The 1905 Act reconstituted local water, sewerage and irrigation authorities, bringing them under the Commission's general jurisdiction.  Rural water supply, sewerage and irrigation schemes continued to be directly managed by a variety of local authorities, including municipalities;  mostly constituted under the Water Act, but some with their own legislation.  From 1958 sewerage authorities were constituted under the Sewerage Districts Act.  Increasingly, the Commission took responsibility for construction of waterworks, while local authorities were responsible for reticulation, management and distribution.

Water Works and Supply Schemes

In addition to its responsibilities for construction of water works and oversight of local authorities, the Commission itself directly managed water supply schemes in a growing number of rural areas.  These schemes included a number of large urban supplies.  Originally the Commission took over responsibility for the Coliban (Bendigo - Castlemaine) and Geelong schemes from the Victorian Water Supply Department (VA 2787).  It later took on other urban schemes, including the Mornington Peninsula, Bellarine and Otways systems.  From 1915 the Commission became ... truncated</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Four main systems (Yan Yean, Maroondah, O'Shannassy, and Upper Yarra) supply Melbourne with water.  The first of these (Yan Yean) was inaugurated in the 1850's.  Responsibility for urban water supply and sewerage originally belonged with the City of Melbourne (1842 to date).  In 1853 it was passed to the Commissioners of Sewers and Water Supply (1853-1860), thence to the Public Works Department, and finally to the Melbourne &amp; Metropolitan Board of Works (1891 to date) now known as Melbourne Water.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Historically, sewerage lagged behind water supply and the inability of the early water authorities to deal effectively with sewerage problems was a major factor in the establishment of the Board in 1891.  Only in the second half of the twentieth century did the supply of sewerage to newly settled areas become nearly simultaneous with water supply.  A major ancillary function has been the survey and mapping of urban and catchment areas under the Board's control.  Diverse other responsibilities associated with water have included  the management of catchment areas.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;PERIOD OF FIRST SETTLEMENT TO 1860&lt;BR /&gt;: CITY OF MELBOURNE &amp; COMMISSIONERS OF SEWERS &amp; WATER SUPPLY&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;From its establishment in 1836, Melbourne drew its water supply direct from the Yarra River.  As the population grew, this became hazardous to public health.  The City of Melbourne established 1842, had formal responsibility for water supply and sewerage but lacked the necessary finance to construct its own water supply and sewers works.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1853 the colonial government established the Commissioners of Sewers &amp; Water Supply to take control of water supply functions.  Works were undertaken by the Sewerage and Water (Supply) Commission whose staff were part of the civil establishment of the colony, responsible to the Commissioner of Public Works and effectively part of the Public Works Department.  The Commissioners built the Yan Yean water supply but "shied away from building the more difficult and costly sewers" (Tony Dingle &amp; Carolyn Rasmussen, Vital Connections M.M.B.W., 1991, p.18).  Initially these works were financed by an advance from the Colonial Treasurer to be repaid within a period of twenty five years.  The Water Works Debenture Act 1855 authorised the Colonial Treasurer to issue debentures and the money raised was to be used to finance the work of the Commissioners.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;PERIOD FROM 1860 TO 1891&lt;BR /&gt;: MELBOURNE SEWERAGE &amp; WATER SUPPLY DEPARTMENT&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;On 12 December 1859, by Order of the Governor in Council and under the provisions of the Melbourne Sewerage and Water Amendment Act 1858, the Board of Commissioners of Sewerage and Water Supply was dissolved and its powers and property vested in the Board of Lands and Works (VA 744).  Operationally, this responsibility was exercised by a branch of the Public Works Department known as the Melbourne Sewerage and Water Supply Department.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Water supply generated a revenue surplus, but successive colonial governments were unwilling to apply it to capital works for sewerage out of fear that country voters would resent increased spending on the metropolis.  This led to urban dissatisfaction at what was seen as a hidden tax on city dwellers since surplus water revenues were applied to consolidated funds.  Melbourne municipal government had been kept fragmented to prevent the formation of a metropolitan power and tax base which would rival the colonial government's own.  There existed, in consequence, no single municipal authority capable of discharging water supply and sewerage functions throughout the metropolitan area.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Town Clerk of Melbourne, E.G. Fitzgibbon, was prominent amongst those urging the formation of a single body representative of municipalities on the model of London's Metropolitan Board of Works as an alternative to government control.  Other municipalities, many of which feared domination by Melbourne, could not agree, however, on the basis of representation.  See David Dunstan, Governing the Metropolis ... (Melbourne, 1984).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;As the sanitary crisis worsened, municipal conferences continued to disagree about what should be done until, in the late 1880s, a majority agreed to support the idea of a Board of Works for Melbourne.  A Royal Commission into Sanitation recommended the establishment of a Board to provide a sewerage system and to take over control of the water supply and rivers and water courses in the metropolis.  The Commission recommended establishment of a small Board of experts, independent of municipal control.  The municipalities, however, demanded and won government agreement to the formation of a body representative of and largely controlled by municipal interests. This pattern of control lasted until 1978, when the government resumed a large measure of control leading, in time, to the corporatisation of the Board's functions and its break up into diverse businesses.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;PERIOD FROM 1891 TO 1991&lt;BR /&gt;: MELBOURNE &amp; METROPOLITAN BOARD OF WORKS (M.M.B.W.)&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works (M.M.B.W.) was established in 1891 under the Melbourne Metropolitan Board of Works Act 1890 (No.1197) which received Royal Assent on 20 December 1890.  The Board held its first meeting on 18 March 1891, but it was not formally constituted until its proclamation by Parliament on 1 July 1891.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Under s.60 of the M.M.B.W. Act of 1890, the new Board took over from the Board of Lands and Works (VA 744) responsibility for the ownership of all Melbourne metropolitan waterworks, sewers, drains, property, land, buildings, plant, river beds and banks except for those river beds and banks vested in the Melbourne Harbour Trust Commissioners, Victorian Railways Commissioners (VA 2876) and the City of Melbourne, and for all related debts and contracts.  Operational responsibility for Melbourne's water supply and sewerage was taken over from a branch of Public Works (VA 669), the Melbourne Sewerage and Water Supply Department.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The 1890 Act established a Board of thirty nine unpaid Commissioners, all drawn from Melbourne and Metropolitan Councils, and a full-time elected Chairman.  Amending Acts in 1945 and 1953 increased the number of Commissioners to fifty four by 1978.  Following a Board of Inquiry in 1977, the constitution of the M.M.B.W. was changed by the Melbourne Metropolitan Board of Works (Reconstruction) Act 1978 (No.9165) and from 1 August 1978 the Board comprised a full-time appointed Chairman and six part-time members (four elected by Area Commissions - groupings of municipalities - and two Government appointees: Victorian Yearbook 1980, p.304).  The Board also worked through a number of permanent Committees - Officers and Servants, Finance, Water Supply, Sewerage, Farm, as well as Planning and Highways 1956-1974 and Planning 1974-1985.  The Melbourne Metropolitan Board of Works (Offices) Act 1982 instituted senior management reforms including a change in the status of Chairman from full to part-time and the appointment of a General Manager.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;E.G. Fitzgibbon became the Board's first Chairman.  In late 1890 an English sanitary engineer, James Mansergh, visited Melbourne to provide recommendations on the development of a sewerage system.  His recommendations have guided the subsequent history of Melbourne's systems (M.M.B.W. 75th Anniversary and Annual Report, 1965-1966).  Over time, the M.M.B.W. subsumed water authorities in surrounding areas which were progressively swallowed up in Melbourne's urban sprawl.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;PERIOD FROM 1991 TO DATE&lt;BR /&gt;: MELBOURNE WATER&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Melbourne Water is the successor in law and the body responsible for the functions carried out by the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works.  It was formed by the merger of the M.M.B.W. with other local water authorities on 1 September 1991.  Under the Melbourne Water Corporation Act 1992 (Act No.54, 1992), which received Royal Assent on 30 June 1992, the M.M.B.W. as then constituted continues in existence under the name Melbourne Water Corporation (known as Melbourne Water).  The 1992 Act does not repeal the earlier Act.  Melbourne Water has the functions conferred on it by the 1992 Act, the 1891 Act (as amended) and any other Act.  The Melbourne Water Corporation Act was proclaimed on 30 June 1992.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Under section 51 of the Act, Melbourne Water took over responsibilities for water supply, sewerage and drainage functions formerly undertaken by:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;   	Dandenong - Springvale Water Board; &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;   	Emerald District Water Board; &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;   	Dandenong Valley and Westernport Authority; &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;   	Mornington Peninsula and District Water Board; &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;   	Pakenham Water Board and the&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;   	Lang Lang Water Board&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;in the geographic areas formerly administered by these bodies.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Melbourne Water also had responsibility for development of metropolitan waterways.  Major initiatives as at February 1993 included the construction of the North West Sewer, continued expansion of open space, improvement of waterways and implementation of customer services programs.  Melbourne Water had three regional offices in metropolitan Melbourne to increase its capacity to respond quickly to the concerns of customers, local government and trades people.  These three regional offices were reconstituted in 1994 as State-owned business enterprises under the State Owned Enterprises Act 1992 trading as Yarra Valley Water Limited, City West Water Limited and South East Water Limited.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Melbourne Water remains responsible for the control of water supply headworks, major wastewater treatment and transfer infrastructure and drainage in metropolitan Melbourne.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;During 1992, Melbourne Water Corporation was administered by a Commissioner.  From 1993, the corporation was administered by a Board of Directors with a maximum of six members (Part 3 of the 1992 Act).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE FUNCTIONS&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The M.M.B.W. took over the Yan Yean Reservoir (constructed 1857) and subsequently constructed a number of major storage reservoirs - Toorourrong- Maroondah (1927), O'Shannassy (1928), Silvan (1931), Upper Yarra (1957), Cardinia and Winneke.  These reservoirs are linked to a number of metropolitan service reservoirs.  The Werribee Treatment Farm and pumping station at Spotswood formed part of the original sewerage scheme developed by the Board.  The Brooklyn pumping station began operation in 1964 and in the same year construction of the South Eastern Scheme began (Melbourne Metropolitan Board of Works Annual Report 1965-1966).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;MAIN DRAINS AND STORM WATER FUNCTIONS&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The M.M.B.W.'s responsibility for rivers, creeks, drains, surface water, and flood control was made definite in 1923 by the Metropolitan Drainage and Rivers Act which vested responsibility in the Board for the drainage of surface water and rainwater flowing through more than one municipality.  Later amendments extended the Board's responsibilities and the provisions of these Acts were consolidated in the 1958 Melbourne Metropolitan Board of Works Act.  At first, efforts were concentrated on the management of rivers and water courses and on the building of main drains to control floods.  From the late 1950s, the Board sought "non-structural" solutions by reserving flood plains and natural valleys from development.  These reserves were often used for recreational purposes and, as the city developed, for freeway construction.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Medical Establishment and Public Hospitals 1837-1854&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The earliest manifestations of the public health function in Victoria occurred with the appointment of an Assistant Colonial Surgeon in 1837 and the establishment of the first public hospital in 1839. Between 1837 and 1854 the medical establishment grew considerably to comprise a Chief Medical Officer, district surgeons to the police and gaols, medical staff at Pentridge and at hospitals on the goldfields, a dispenser, and a health officer at Queenscliff. A temporary seven bed hospital and dispensary provided the only facilities until the establishment of a small general hospital in Melbourne in 1841. The hospital initially occupied a rented cottage until building was completed in Lonsdale Street in 1848. Hospitals were later established on the goldfields at Castlemaine, Sandhurst and Ballarat (The Australian Encyclopaedia, Volume V, p.2;  see also Historical Records of Victoria, Volume 3).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The medical establishment and public hospitals were primarily concerned with providing medical services to Government employees (police, military, Gold Commissioners) as well as to people under Government care (such as immigrants, prisoners, lunatics). The Chief Medical Officers Health Report for the half year ending 30 June 1854 indicates that the medical establishment in Melbourne was responsible for immigrants from the time of their landing until they left the Immigration Depot and for the police and the officers and prisoners in the gaols and stockades. The immigrants were attended by the Chief Medical Officer and the more serious cases were taken to the Colonial Hospital at Batman's Hill. In the seaport towns the medical officers were responsible for the health of immigrants, police, military and prisoners and on the goldfields they were responsible for police, military, gold commission and prisoners (see Votes and Proceedings of the Legislative Council, Session 1854-5, Volume 2, p.89).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Concern for the prevention of infectious and contagious disease appears to have initially been handled by regulation of vessels entering Port Phillip (see the quarantine function).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Patrick Edward Cussen was appointed as Assistant Colonial Surgeon for Port Phillip in September 1837. By 1848 Cussen had been appointed Colonial Surgeon. Following separation from New South Wales in 1851, the civil establishment for the Medical Department, which was responsible to the Colonial Secretary (VRG 16), included the Colonial Surgeon, Melbourne who was also Surgeon to the Gaol and Surgeon to the Lunatic Asylum, the District Surgeon, Geelong, a Dispenser and the Superintendent and staff of the Lunatic Asylum (VA 2839). By 1852 following the discovery of gold, the civil establishment of the Medical Department had expanded to include the Colonial Surgeon, a Health Officer, Dispenser, Surgeon to Police and Watchhouses, three Assistant Colonial Surgeons in Melbourne and three others for Geelong, Williamstown and Ovens.  Other staff were also located at Mt. Alexander, Bendigo and Ovens.  By 1854 the civil establishment included a Chief Medical Officer, District Surgeons to Police and to Gaols and at Williamstown, Geelong, Portland, Belfast, Castlemaine, Sandhurst, Ballarat, Avoca, Beechworth, Kyneton and Kilmore and other staff based at Pentridge and at the hospitals established on the goldfields at Castlemaine, Sandhurst and Ballarat.  There was also a Secretary to the Medical Board and Dispenser, a Medical Officer at Waranga and a Health Officer at Queenscliff.   &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Diverse Public Health Legislation 1854-1865&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Control of Infectious Disease and Regulation of Noxious Trades&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Central Board of Health was established in 1854 under the provisions of An Act for Promoting Public Health in Populous Places in the Colony of Victoria (18 Vic., No.13). The Act also provided for the establishment of local boards of health which were to exercise joint responsibility for public health. The provisions were taken verbatim from an Imperial Act of 1848. The President and members of the Central Board were appointed on 21 February 1855. Under the Act the Central Board of Health and the local boards were required to make provision for the prevention, containment and treatment of infectious and contagious diseases;  for the construction and maintenance of adequate drains and sewers;  for the regulation of noxious trades;  for the cleansing of streets and public ways and places and for the maintenance of adequate standards of sanitation and ventilation in both public and  premises. No new hospital for the reception of patients suffering from a contagious or infectious disease was to be opened without the approval of the Central Board of Health and the appropriate local board and the Central Board could authorise the dispensing of medicines and the provision of medical aid to persons afflicted by or threatened by epidemic diseases. Local board officers were also empowered to seize unwholesome food from manufacturers and vendors and to bring the offenders before a Justice of the Peace.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Local boards were required to report every three months to the Central Board on the health, cleanliness and general sanitary state of the district for which they were responsible and each report was to be accompanied either by a certificate from the health officer stating that no epidemic, endemic or contagious disease had appeared or a report as to the progress or decrease of such a disease, including the number of deaths and the class of persons suffering from any particular disorder.  The Central Board was required to make recommendations for the control of any epidemic disease and local boards were required to notify the Central Board immediately such a disease became evident.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Regulation of Common Lodging Houses&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Under the provisions of An Act for the well ordering of Common Lodging Houses in the Colony of Victoria 1854 (18 Vic., No.8), local authorities were empowered to establish and enforce standards for the cleanliness, condition and conduct of common lodging houses.  All such premises were to be registered with the local authority which was required to maintain a register.  Under the provisions of the Public Health Act 1854, the Central Board of Health was empowered to regulate the number of inmates and occupants permissable in a lodging house or public building.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Vaccination&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Compulsory vaccination of all children born after 1 January 1840 was required under the provisions of An Act to make compulsory the Practice of Vaccination 1854 (18 Vic., No.4).  Medical Officers were to issue certificates affirming successful vaccination and parents were required to lodge the certificates with the local Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages.  Registration of vaccination certificates later became a responsibility of the Registrar General (VA 2889).  The Act required the Registrars to notify parents of the requirement to have their children vaccinated and parents who failed to do so could be fined.  Medical Officers were not permitted to charge fees for the provision of this service.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Pollution of the River Yarra&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;From 1855, with the passing of An Act to prevent the further pollution of the waters of the river Yarra Yarra above the city of Melbourne 1854 (18 Vic., No.36), no new unwholesome trades or businesses could be established on the banks of the Yarra River above Melbourne.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Adulteration of Food or Drink&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Requirements for the manufacture and sale of articles of food and drink which included medical drugs and items usually taken or sold as medicines became more stringent with the passing of An Act to prevent the Adulteration of Articles of Food or Drink 1863 (27 Vic., No.177).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Consolidation of Public Health Legislation 1865&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1865, previous legislation regarding public health, vaccination, quarantine, pollution of the Yarra River, common lodging houses and the adulteration of food and drink was consolidated in the Public Health Statute 1865 (28 Vic., No.264).  The Central Board of Health and the local boards continued to be responsible for the administration of all aspects of public health.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;New Aspects of Public Health 1867 to 1890&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Much of the subsequent legislation concerning public health simply increased or amended the powers of the Central Board of Health and the local authorities with regard to the administration of aspects of public health for which they had previously been responsible.  However some of the legislation gave the boards responsibility for new aspects of public health.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Public Buildings&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;From 1867, under the provisions of the Public Health Amendment Act, (No.310) persons wishing to open or extend any hospital, public building or place of amusement were required to notify the Central Board of Health and the local board and to submit a plan showing the proposed mode of construction, drainage and ventilation.  No such building could be built or opened without the written approval of the Central Board of Health.  The officers of the boards were also empowered to inspect such premises and to order work to be undertaken to improve the ventilation, drainage, entrances and exits and appliances for the extinction of fires.  These requirements and the definition of buildings subject to regulation by the Central Board of Health were extended under the provisions of the Public Health Amendment Act 1883 (No.782).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Hospitals&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;From 1876 under sections 18 and 19 of the Public Health Amendment Act (No.524) which were re-enactments of an 1875 Imperial Act (38 and 39 Vic., C55), local boards were empowered to provide hospitals for the reception of the sick.  The boards could establish the hospitals alone or combine with other boards to do so.  Alternatively they could contract the use of an existing hospital or enter into an agreement with the management of an existing hospital to provide the required services.  Managers of hospitals receiving aid from the State could be required by the Central Board of Health to enter into such an agreement with a local board.  The costs of treatment were to be recovered from the patient or from his/her estate.  The Public Health Act 1889 empowered the central authorities to establish hospitals where local authorities failed to do so.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Infant Life Protection&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;With the proclamation of the Public Health Amendment Act 1883 No.782, part III of which was a re-enactment of an Imperial Act 36 and 36 Vic., c38, 1872, local boards became responsible for the registration of premises and persons, other than parents, relatives or guardians, who were responsible for the care of infants.  The boards were to maintain a register of premises and persons approved and those responsible were to keep a register of infants in their care and to notify the coroner or a justice of the peace of the death of a child.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Under the provisions of the Infant Life Protection Act 1980 the Chief Commissioner of Police was vested in 1890 with reponsibility for the registration of  homes used for the purpose of nursing, maintaining and adopting infants.  In 1907 a subsequent Infant Life Protection Act 1907 transferred responsibility for this function to the Department for Neglected Children, later known as the Children's Welfare Department (VA 1467) in the Chief Secretary's Department (VA 475).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The powers and responsibilities of the Central Board of Health and the local boards were further amended by the Public Health Act 1888 (No.1101).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;, M.D. was appointed President and Captain Clarke and Richard Youl M.D. were appointed as members of the Board.  McCrea was the Chief Medical Office... truncated</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Society's attitudes to and understanding of psychiatric illness has changed significantly since the 1840's and these changes have been reflected in the nature of the institutions established and in the policies and structure of the central administration.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;What follows is an account of some of these developments.  It is an outline only and further research is required.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;To assist researchers to locate the records they require it is necessary that the historical terms for psychiatric illness be used in this account of the administration of mental health in Victoria.  It is acknowledged that this decision has resulted in the inclusion of terms  which today are considered most offensive.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Detention of Lunatics&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Under the provisions of An Act to make provision for the safe custody of and prevention of offences by persons dangerously insane and for the care and maintenance of persons of unsound mind 1843 (7 Vic., No.14) persons certified as "dangerous lunatics" or "dangerous idiots" could be committed by warrant to a gaol, house of correction or public hospital until discharged on the authority of two Justices of the Peace or until, on the order of the Governor, they were removed to a colonial lunatic asylum. Prior to 1848 lunatics were either detained in gaols or transferred to the Tarban Creek Lunatic Asylum in New South Wales.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1848 the first permanent institution for the detention of lunatics within the Port Phillip District was established as a ward of the Tarban Creek Lunatic Asylum. Despite the establishment of this institution at Yarra Bend, the authorities continued to place lunatics in gaols.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Following the establishment of Victoria as a separate colony in 1851, the Colonial Secretary (VRG 16) became responsible for the Yarra Bend Lunatic Asylum (VA 2839). The Civil Establishments for 1851 and 1852 show John Sullivan as holding the posts of Colonial Surgeon, Medical Officer to the Lunatic Asylum and Surgeon to the Gaol.  In 1853 Robert Bowie was appointed as Surgeon Superintendent of the Lunatic Asylum and William McCrea became Colonial Surgeon, later Chief Medical Officer.  There is evidence in the Civil Establishment lists to suggest that the Chief Medical Officer had responsibility for the Asylum until at least 1856 and Appendix 14 of the Report of the Committee of Inquiry into Hospital and Health Services in Victoria (1975) suggests that this relationship continued until 1861 from which time the Superintendent of the Asylum was directly responsible to the Chief Secretary (VRG 26).  From 1856 the Civil Establishment shows the staff of the lunatic asylums as part of the Chief Secretary's Department (VA 475).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Lunacy Statute 1867&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1867, with the passing of the Lunacy Statute (No.309), the law relating to the treatment of lunatics was consolidated and significantly amended.  The 1867 Act regulated the admission, detention and treatment of patients and established standards for the management of public asylums and  institutions. The Lunacy Statute provided for the proclamation of public asylums which were institutions for the reception of lunatics and their detention at public cost.  A distinction was apparently made between an "asylum" and a "receiving hospital", the latter being intended for the reception of patients prior to diagnosis and long term committal to an asylum.  The Act also provided for the establishment of lunacy wards within public hospitals.  These wards were intended to be reception centres for the short term treatment of those suffering from transient insanity, that is, those who might reasonably be expected to recover within a matter of days or weeks.The Act also provided for the licensing of  institutions for the reception of lunatics and these were to be known as licensed houses. Licensed houses were required to meet standards of management and patient care and to maintain records comparable with those required of public asylums.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Yarra Bend Asylum (VA 2839), the Collingwood Receiving Hospital (VA 2851) the Royal Park temporary Lunatic Asylum (all previously existing institutions) and the newly established Ararat Asylum (VA 2841) and Beechworth Asylum (VA 2842) were proclaimed as public asylums on 1 October 1867.  &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Lunacy Statute also provided for the appointment of an Inspector of Lunatic Asylums and Licensed Houses and for the appointment of Official Visitors. The Inspector of Lunatic Asylums and Licensed Houses was required to visit every institution at least once in every three months.  The Official Visitors were empowered to visit and report on the condition of the asylums and on the treatment of patients.  These authorities were required to inspect the buildings;  to see every patient and to inquire whether any patient was held under restraint;  to inspect the orders and certificates authorising the reception of all patients admitted since their last visit and to prepare a report of their findings.  They were also required "to inquire as to the care, treatment and mental and bodily health of the patients" and as to "the arrangements for their maintenance and comfort, ... what occupations or amusements are provided, ... whether there has been adopted any system of coercion or noncoercion ... and also as to the classification and the dietary of the patients".  (See Lunacy Act 1867.)&lt;BR /&gt;Every institution was required to keep an Inspector's Book and a Patients Book in which the authorities were to record their observations and recommendations.  The Inspector was also empowered to authorise visits to patients by relatives and medical personnel and to authorise the transfer of patients, their absence from an institution or their placement in the care of a relative or friend.  However only the Chief Secretary could authorise the transfer of a patient from one institution to another.  The Inspector could also recommend the discharge of a patient but all discharges required the consent of the Chief Secretary and were usually arranged by the person who signed the original admission order.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Chief Secretary (VRG 26) was responsible for the administration of the granting of licences to licensed houses.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;On 1 October 1867 Edward Paley, Superintendent of the Yarra Bend Asylum, was appointed to the position of Inspector of Lunatic Asylums and Licensed Houses. With this appointment a Hospitals for the Insane Branch (VA 2863) was established within the Chief Secretary's Department (VA 475).  From this time the Civil Establishment lists show staff of the individual lunatic asylums as part of  the Hospitals for the Insane Branch and a separate division for this Branch is found within the Appropriation Acts.  However it is not until 1884 that a separate reference to the Inspector's Office is found in the Civil Establishment lists and this may be because the incumbent continued to be a Medical Superintendent of one of the asylums.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;As the Hospitals for the Insane Branch was located within the Chief Secretary's Department, the Under-Secretary of that Department, as its permanent head, had responsibility for those officers employed within the Civil and later the Public Service.  However, the Inspector of Lunatic Asylums and Licensed Houses appears to have exercised effective authority in matters of policy and the operation of institutions and was required to report directly to the Chief Secretary and thence to Parliament.  The Inspector also made recommendations regarding the appointment and supervision of personnel, though many decisions required the approval of the Public Service Commissioner.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Royal Commission on Asylums for the Insane and Inebriates 1884 - 1886&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Royal Commission on Asylums for the Insane and Inebriate was commissioned on 17 May 1884 and presented its report on 29 April 1886.  (See Papers Presented to Parliament 1886, Vol.2, p.271.)&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Frequently referred to as the Zox Commission, the Royal Commission was required to inquire into and report upon the state and condition of Asylums for the Insane and Inebriates, both public and .  Its inquiries were extensive and the Commission produced two progress reports prior to its final report in 1886.  The Commission was empowered to inquire into the mode and management (of institutions), remedial treatment and results, the classification of inmates, the policy of continuing large metropolitan institutions, the advisability of licensing patients to  individuals, the due classification of the imbecile and the insane, the proper position of medical officers in relation to the system of management, special qualifications necessary for all officers and employees before appointment and their mode of appointment, the system of official visitors and inspection, the mode of obtaining supplies and any further matter that appeared important to the Commissioners.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Royal Commission made some sixty five recommendations in its final report. A number of the Commission's recommendations were implemented prior to the presentation of its final report, others were implemented through the Lunacy Amendment Act 1888 and some recommendations were not implemented until proclamation of the Lunacy Act 1903 in 1905.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Commission recommended that criminal patients be kept apart from other patients and that an asylum for criminal lunatics be erected at Sunbury. In December 1886 the old gaol at Ararat was proclaimed as "J Ward" of the Ararat Asylum (VA 2841).  It was intended to cater for the admission of the criminally insane. Prior to their transfer to "J Ward", patients had to be certified as insane by two medical practitioners and the Chief Secretary was responsible for the issue of a warrant authorising their transfer to "J Ward". The asylum at Sunbury was not completed until 1893 by which time the authorities decided to retain Ararat Gaol as an asylum for male criminal lunatics and use the new Sunbury ward for the detention of female patients considered dangerous to themselves or others.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Lunacy Amendment Act 1888&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Provision for the detention of the criminally insane was formally introduced with the Lunacy Amendment Act 1888 (No.986). The criminally insane were defined as those persons detained in a gaol, reformatory or industrial school who appeared to be insane and those persons who had been ordered to be kept in safe custody under the provisions of the Criminal Law and Practice Act i.e. those who were to be detained during the "Governor's pleasure".  The 1888 Act authorised the transfer of insane prisoners to an asylum for the criminally insane.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Act also provided for the proclamation of receiving houses which were to be any asylum or portion of an asylum which was intended for the short term detention of patients.  Orders for the initial committal of patients were to be made for a period not exceeding 28 days and patients were to be placed first in a receiving house for a period of observation.  Patients were to be immediately examined and if they were found to be insane they could be transferred to an asylum.  However if they were found not to be insane they were to be discharged.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Act also required the annual examination of patients unless they were being detained at the Queen's pleasure and medical practitioners were required to report to the Inspector of Lunatic Asylums and to forward a copy of the report to the Chief Secretary.  If the Inspector concurred that a patient was not insane, the patient could be discharged and in the event of a difference of medical opinion, the Chief Secretary was to determine the outcome.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Act also authorised the establishment of separate accommodation for paying patients and the boarding out of patien... truncated</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The School Medical Service was established within the Education Department in 1909 following official concern regarding the results of a study of student health undertaken at a suburban school. The Service was required to investigate the hygiene condition of school premises and the physical and mental health of children. It was also responsible for providing health education instruction to children and their teachers.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Following the proclamation of the Ministry of Health Act (No.4988) in 1944, the School Medical Service was transferred to the Maternal and Child Welfare Branch of the Department of Health (VA 6950.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Students&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Initially the Service employed medical practitioners who visited suburban schools. Subsequently it also employed nurses and provided service to country schools. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Service conducted audiometric and visual screening tests and medical examinations for all children at particular grade levels and examined children referred by parents and teachers. Children requiring medical treatment were referred to local practitioners and community facilities. The School Nursing Service provided both medical support and counselling to children with physical, emotional, behavioural and social problems and visiting nurses were responsible for providing health education for students, parents and staff.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Special advisory services were provided to the parents of children with hearing, speech and learning difficulties. Staff worked with other professionals, teachers and parents to develop programmes to meet the special educational needs of children with intellectual or physical disabilities.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;By the 1960s the school population had risen significantly. It was no longer possible to continue universal screening by medical practitioners and from 1973, they no longer made scheduled visits to secondary schools. However they continued to accept referrals from visiting nurses.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;As at 1996, the service is known as the School Nursing Programme and medical practitioners are no longer employed. Registered nurses visit primary schools and test the vision of all students at specified grade levels. They also test the hearing and general health of all children referred for examination by teachers or parents. There are plans to change the focus of the Programme by giving far greater emphasis to the role of school nurses in the provision of health education.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Teachers&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;A medical assessment service was provided for teachers and prospective teachers, the latter being designed to identify people likely to be unsuitable for teaching. Health certificates were required from all applicants for studentships and graduate students were examined on completion of their training to determine their suitability for teaching.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Service also examined teachers who were applicants for permanent appointment, membership of the State Superannuation Fund, transfer on medical grounds, extended sick leave or early retirement on grounds of ill health. The Service thus filled a role for the teaching service similar to that undertaken by the Government Medical Officer for other public servants.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;As at 1996, this role is not undertaken by the School Nursing Programme. It is not known when the Service lost responsibility for the assessment of teachers but it remained part of their role until at least the mid - 1970s.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Dental Services&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1921 the School Medical Service was expanded to include a dental service. From at least the 1930s, the service included the treatment of children at both city and country schools. The treatment was provided through clinics established in Melbourne and regional centres, the use of mobile dental units which travelled to more remote rural destinations and visiting dentists who travelled to provincial towns. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Service examined all children in the early years of primary schooling for whom it had received parental consent. The children were then provided with continuing treatment until they entered secondary school. The Service provided initial preventative and remedial care and undertook minor orthodontic work. Children requiring major orthodontic work were referred to  practitioners.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Service included a number of dental officers who treated children living in institutions for the physically and intellectually disabled. The Director of Child Health (Dental) also supervised the treatment of children under the care of the Social Welfare Department and its successors. These children were treated by  practitioners on a fee for service or sessional basis.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Since the mid 1970s, the Service has received significant capital and recurrent funding from the Commonwealth Government.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1992 the dental service was separated from the medical service. The Service continues to employ dental therapists and dental nurses who provide onsite treatment at schools and at dental clinics. There are proposals to extend the service to pre-school children and year 7 and 8 students who have been treated at primary school, provided federal funding is maintained.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Sources&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Education Act 1928 (No. 3671)&lt;BR /&gt;	section 47&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Ministry of Health Act 1943 (No. 4988) &lt;BR /&gt;	section 10 (2);  first schedule part B (8)&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Return of Persons Employed in the Public Service  1921 to 1988&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Annual Reports of the Education Department  1932, 1943, 1944&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Report of the Committee of Inquiry into Hospital and Health Services in Victoria July 1975, pages 263-275.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Ms Jean Farrington, head of the School Nursing Programme (1996)&lt;BR /&gt;Ms Sue Seshan, head of the School Dental Service (1996) &lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Industry Regulation&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The registration of factories is for our purposes viewed as a specific function within a broader context of industry regulation.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The term "industry" conveys a notion of all trade or manufacturing concerns including agricultural pursuits, utilisation of natural resources, finance and banking services, tourist facilities, retail traders and other service providers. The regulation of "industry" may therefore relate to one or more of the particular industry sectors or may relate to industry as a whole (ie. all sectors).&lt;BR /&gt;The registration of factories was the prime mechanism introduced to regulate manufacturing enterprises with respect to physical employment conditions (workplace health and safety) and non-physical employment conditions (wages, leave entitlements etc.). It also served to regulate free trade thereby protecting certain enterprises from "unfair" competition. Furthermore, factory registration also served to protect public health and welfare. These concerns were initially regulated in the manufacturing industry only, however, from 1915 the retail industry was also regulated in this way through the introduction of shop registration. Gradually the regulation of workplace health and safety and employment conditions, the regulation of free trade and the regulation of public health and welfare came to apply across most industry sectors.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Other forms of industry regulation have been introduced by Government. With respect to the Labour and Industry portfolio the other forms of regulation have included the regulation of retail trading hours, the regulation of  employment agencies, the introduction of consumer protection legislation evolving out of trade practices regulation and the further protection of workplace and public health and safety through the registration and licensing of hairdressers, cinematograph operators, engine drivers, boiler attendants, welders of boilers and pressure vessels, scaffolding inspectors and scaffolders. A further form of regulation which has at times been connected with the Labour and Industry portfolio has been the regulation of the sale and supply of tobacco and liquor.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Factory Registration&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The original purpose of the Supervision of Workrooms and Factories Act 1873 was to "mitigate the worst evils of the factory system" whilst providing for the "exigencies of trade". The legislation was found to be inadequate by a Royal Commission on Employees in Shops, which reported in March 1884. The concerns investigated by the Commission mostly related to the health, safety and welfare of employees in industry. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The recommendations of the Royal Commission included the regulation of industry primarily through the registration of factories which involved the payment of annual fees, ensuring factories were open for inspection, the keeping of employee and other records in factories and payment of penalties for lack of compliance with the legislation. The recommendation with respect to factory registration was introduced following the passing of the Factories and Shops Act 1885 (49 Vic., No.862), which became operative March 1886. The Act provided for the registration and inspection of factories and workrooms in proclaimed metropolitan areas only.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Although the registration of factories developed as a means of improving labour conditions it also enabled industry competition to be controlled. This is particularly evident with the Factories and Shops Amendment Act 1887 (51 Vic., No.961) which extended the definition of factory (by that time defined as a place in which six or more persons worked) to include workplaces employing any number of Chinese. This redefinition of factory was consolidated in the Factories and Shops Act 1896 (60 Vic., No.1445) which introduced specific registration and regulation of furniture factories and Chinese laundries, industries in which Chinese workers operated at competitive rates, to protect the non-Chinese workers in these industries (for example, the widowed charwomen who normally undertook laundry work). &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The 1896 Act also provided for the registration of out-workers in the clothing trade to cope with the "sweating evil" in that trade. Out-workers were employees of factories who worked from home, often at much cheaper rates than workers in factories. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Minister of Labour assumed responsibility for the registration of factories from the Chief Secretary (VRG 26) in 1900.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Until 1912 registration of factories was only required in any city, town or borough although could be applied to shires by Order in Council. An Order in Council was subsequently passed on 2 September 1912 extending to the whole State the provisions of the Factories and Shops Acts relating to factories.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Labour and Industry Act 1953 replaced the Factories and Shops Act with respect to factory registration. The Shop Trading Act 1987, operative from November 1987, repealed the Labour and Industry Act 1958 in so far as it provided for the registration of factories.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Summary of State Regulation of Labour&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;State regulation of labour has had two principal strands: the physical (workplace health and safety) and the non-physical (see industrial relations).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The regulation of workplace health and safety dates back to the Supervision of Workrooms and Factories Act 1873, subsequently replaced by provisions in the Factories and Shops Act 1885. The Minister of Labour assumed responsibility for workplace health and safety in 1900 from the Chief Secretary (VRG 26) although the agency administering the function was the Chief Secretary's Department (VA 475) until 1916.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Over time the function has evolved, encompassing related functions which had quite separate administrative histories but which were subsequently assumed within the Labour and Industry portfolio. These functions include the inspection of boilers which was transferred from the Minister of Mines (VRG 30) in 1962 and occupational health services which was transferred from the Minister of Health (VRG 39) in 1984. The regulation of dangerous goods was also assumed within the Labour and Industry portfolio in 1984 but has been registered as a separate function.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The dangers involved in the operation of certain machinery or equipment such as engines, boilers and  scaffolding were recognised in various Acts including the Factories and Shops Act, Boilers Inspection Act, Boilers and Pressure Vessels Act and the Scaffolding Act. These Acts established Boards of Examiners with responsibility for examining and certifying engine drivers, boiler attendants, welders of boilers and pressure vessels and scaffolders. Inspectors of boilers and scaffolding were also subject to examination and certification by these Boards. The Minister of Mines (VRG 30) and the Minister of Local Government (VRG 57) had responsibility for these functions prior to their transfer to the Minister of Labour and Industry in the 1960's and 1970's.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Prior to the Industrial Safety Health and Welfare Act 1981 the substantive legislative basis for workplace health and safety were the provisions of the Labour and Industry Act which had replaced the Factories and Shops Act. Provisions with respect to specific technical workplace safety matters were also administered pursuant to the Lifts Regulation Act (later Lifts and Cranes Act), the Boilers and Pressure Vessels Act and the Scaffolding Act.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The shift in focus of workplace health and safety from industry and commercial enterprises to all workplaces occurred in 1985 with the introduction of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 1985. This Act consolidated many provisions relating to workplace health and safety. The Occupational Health and Safety Act 1985 was introduced as part of the legislation establishing the WorkCare workers compensation scheme. Although the regulation of workplace health and safety became notionally linked with the workers compensation function through WorkCare, the functions continued to be administered separately. The Dangerous Goods Act 1985 which was also passed at this time consolidated provisions relating to the regulation of dangerous goods.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;At the agency level administrative responsibility for the enforcement of workplace health and safety passed from the Chief Secretary's Department (VA 475) to the Department of Labour I (VA 2874) in 1916, to the Department of Labour and Industry (VA 1027) in 1954, to the Ministry of Employment and Training (VA 704) in 1984 and to the Department of Labour II (VA 2777) in 1985.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The development and promotion of workplace health and safety standards has been overseen since the 1960's by a succession of statutory bodies namely the Industrial Safety Advisory Council, the Industrial Safety Health and Welfare Advisory Council (VA 1371) and the Occupational Health and Safety Commission (VA 1647).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Since 1992 the development and promotion of standards and the implementation and enforcement of those standards have been the responsibility of a single agency, the Occupational Health and Safety Authority of the Department of Business and Employment (VA 3096).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Workplace Health and Safety&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The earliest attempt at regulating workplace health and safety in Victoria was made with the passing of the Supervision of Workrooms and Factories Act 1873 (37 Vic., No.466) which provided for the Central and local Boards of Health to inspect factories and to make regulations with respect to the number of persons employed in any one room as well as ventilation, cleanliness and sanitary requirements. The legislation was found to be inadequate by a Royal Commission on Employees in Shops, which reported in March 1884. The concerns investigated by the Commission mostly all related to the health, safety and welfare of employees in industry. The specific areas focussed on were:&lt;BR /&gt;the suitability of premises as factories (noting a lack of cleanliness, insufficient sanitation, poor ventilation and overcrowding)&lt;BR /&gt;the hours of employment&lt;BR /&gt;the employment of women and young persons&lt;BR /&gt;the ratio of apprentices to trained employees&lt;BR /&gt;intervals for meals&lt;BR /&gt;precautions against machinery accidents&lt;BR /&gt;the "sweating" system (ie. employees working in homes).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Factories and Shops Act 1885 (49 Vic., No.862), which became operative in March 1886, provided for: &lt;BR /&gt;standards of sanitary and employment conditions including cleanliness, ventilation and provision of meal breaks&lt;BR /&gt;guarding of machinery and equipment and notification of accidents causing death or injury.&lt;BR /&gt;The provisions of this Act applied to metropolitan areas only and were enforced through the registration and inspection of factories - see factory registration and industrial compliance.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;A Factories Office was established within the Chief Secretary's Department (VA 475) to ensure the operation of the Act. The Central Board of Health, also within the Chief Secretary's Department, was given responsibility for approving plans and particulars of new factories and workrooms as well as enforcing standards of sanitary conditions. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Other provisions subsequently introduced by amendments to the Factories and Shops Act included:&lt;BR /&gt;prohibition of overcrowding in shops&lt;BR /&gt;requirement for shops to have fire fighting equipment&lt;BR /&gt;prohibition of girls lifting heavy weights&lt;BR /&gt;requirement for first-aid appliances to be kept on premises.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Department of Labour I (VA 2874) was established in 1916 and assumed responsibility for functions previously exercised by the Factories Office. The Labour and Industry Act 1953 replaced the provisions of the Factories and Shops Act with respect to workplace health and safety. The Department of Labour was renamed as the Department of Labour and Industry (VA 1027) in 1954.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;By 1954 workplace health and safety encompassed the maintenance of standards prescribed under the Factories and Shops legislation with respect to the safety and suitability of buildings, the safe operation of machinery, the comfort of employees and other physical conditions (ensuring that they were free from hazard). It also encompassed notification of factory accidents, representation on safety standards committees, industrial safety training courses, promotion and publicity of industrial safety and the regulation of lifts.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Industrial Safety Health and Welfare Act 1981 (No.9717) replaced the workplace health and safety provisions previously contained in the Labour and Industry Act 1958 with a more broadly based approach to industrial safety health and welfare. The legislation placed specific responsibilities and duties on the occupiers of workplaces, the manufacturers and installers of all equipment used in the workplace and the sellers and hirers of machinery. Provision was also made for the formation of safety committees and the election of safety representatives. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;On 1 July 1984 the occupational health services function of the Health Commission (VA 652) was assumed into the broader workplace health and safety function undertaken by the Department of Labour and Industry(VA 1027). This function was combined with the dangerous goods function under the administration of the Ministry of Employment and Training (VA 704).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Occupational Health and Safety Act 1985 (No.10190) came into force 1 October 1985. The Act applies to all workplaces in Victoria. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Further details about specific aspects of the workplace health and safety function are given below.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Building Standards&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Central Board of Health within the Chief Secretary's Department (VA 475) was initially responsible for approving plans and particulars of new factories and workrooms.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;By arrangement with the State Building Directorate, the Department of Labour I (VA 2874) required production of plans and specifications in connection with the building of new factories or the extension of existing factories from May 1946. A departmental architect was appointed in September 1946 to carry out this activity.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Lifts and Cranes&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The administration of the Lifts Regulation Act 1906, which came into force 1 March 1907, was entrusted to the Chief Inspector of Factories. Administration of this Act primarily involved the registration and inspection of lifts, issuing of orders to lift-owners to comply with safety regulations, and investigation of accidents occurring in connection with lifts.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Lifts and Cranes Act 1959 introduced a system of regulation for the use of cranes including conveyors and hoists and other associated gear. It replaced the provisions of the Local Government Act 1958 with respect to the safe working of building cranes which had been administered within the Public Works portfolio (VRG 28) until 1958 and from 1958 to 1959 within the Local Government portfolio (VRG 57).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Lifts and Cranes (Amendment) Act 1970 provided for the certification of riggers, crane drivers, crane chasers and dogmen;  lift mechanics were already required to be licensed.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The registration of amusement structures was introduced pursuant to the Lifts and Cranes (Amusement Structures) Act 1978.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Boilers and Pressure Vessels&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The function inspection of boilers transferred to the administration of the Minister of Labour and Industry on 25 November 1962. Historically, this function was a responsibility of the Minister of Mines (VRG 30).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Department of Labour and Industry undertook the following with respect to boilers and pressure vessels:&lt;BR /&gt;regular inspections&lt;BR /&gt;checking and approval of designs prior to manufacture&lt;BR /&gt;surveillance during construction&lt;BR /&gt;testing and registering new vessels&lt;BR /&gt;certification of vessels prior to sale&lt;BR /&gt;monitoring change of ownership&lt;BR /&gt;receiving reports of mishaps.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Boilers and Pressure Vessels Act 1970, effective from 1 January 1971, updated the legislation and made provisions for plans and specifications of vessels to be submitted to the Chief Inspector before manufacture. The Act also introduced an annual registration fee for owners of boilers and pressure vessels.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Scaffolding&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Scaffolding Act 1971 became operative from 1 August 1974 replacing provisions in the Local Government Act 1958 with respect to the safety of scaffolding which had been administered within the Local Government portfolio (VRG 57) and by Municipalities (VRG 12). From this time the inspection of scaffolding in the Municipal Districts of Melbourne, South Melbourne, Port Melbourne, St. Kilda, Richmond, Collingwood and Fitzroy were the responsibility of the Scaffolding Inspectorate of the Department of Labour and Industry.

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Overview&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Administration of assisted British migration and nomination schemes, including associated reception, settlement and welfare services, was the States primary involvement in immigration in the twentieth century. This involvement ceased in 1983 when responsibility was taken over by the Commonwealth.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;At Federation, responsibility for alien (non-British) immigration and naturalisation formally passed to the Commonwealth (VRG 87) although it appears that the State retained operational responsibility until 1904. &lt;BR /&gt;The Commonwealth Government also assumed responsibility for unassisted British immigration except for a brief period from 1975 to 1983. For these schemes, the Commonwealth Government also undertook overseas promotion and selection as well as reception, settlement, employment and welfare services.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The State monitored migrant arrivals and departures until 1923 when this responsibility also passed to the Commonwealth (VRG 87).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Assisted British Immigration and Associated Services 1906-1930&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Assisted immigration schemes flourished between 1906 and 1930. From 1906 to 1923 administration of assisted British immigration and nomination schemes for Victoria, including overseas promotion of the State and supervision of the selection of migrants, was largely a State responsibility. From 1923 to 1930 the function involved undertaking the State's obligations under a number of joint Imperial, Commonwealth and State government agreements.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;When assisted immigration from Britain resumed in 1906 it was associated with closer settlement and thus was the responsibility of the Commissioner of Crown Lands and Survey (VRG 18) under the Closer Settlement Act 1906 (No.2067).  By 1912 an Immigration and Labour Bureau had been established to administer the British nomination scheme, to provide reception, initial settlement and employment services and to co-ordinate overseas promotion and emigration assistance.  From 1918 to 1923 responsibility for these functions lay with the Minister for Labour (VRG 42).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Under the provisions of the British Empire Settlement Act 1922 a number of agreements were made between the Imperial, Commonwealth and State Governments to encourage British residents to migrate to Australia for the purpose of land settlement and to augment the labour force. Overseas promotion and supervision of selection for these schemes became a Commonwealth responsibility. In Victoria a Minister for Immigration (VRG 44) was appointed in 1923 to be responsible for the State's obligations under the Act and associated schemes, including administration in Victoria of the nomination scheme, determination of numbers and categories of migrants and associated reception, settlement, employment and welfare services.  Operational responsibility was exercised by the Department of Crown Lands and Survey (VA 538) from 1923 to 1927 and the Public Works Department (VA 669) from 1927 to 1930.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;After 1930 assisted immigration and nomination schemes were suspended due to economic depression and World War II although the position of Minister for Immigration continued until 1943.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Post World War II Immigration 1947-1983&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;From 1947 to 1983 substantial numbers of migrants were brought to Victoria under the provisions of various immigration schemes and agreements, including the United Kingdom Free and Assisted Passenger Agreements 1946, Child Migration Scheme from 1947, Empire and Allied Ex-Servicemen's Scheme from 1947, a 1947 agreement between the Commonwealth Government and the International Refugee Organisation facilitating the settlement of European displaced persons and later agreements between the Commonwealth and various European countries.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Under these agreements, primary responsibility for immigration was exercised by the Commonwealth. Following the Premiers Conference of 1946, the State accepted responsibility for:&lt;BR /&gt;processing nominations (later known as sponsorships) of British migrants made by residents of Victoria (personal nominations) for family reunions&lt;BR /&gt;processing nominations (later known as sponsorships) of British migrants made by industry and commerce (employer nominations) and the Victorian Government (State nominations) designed to promote recruitment of particular categories of workers &lt;BR /&gt;determination of numbers and categories of British migrants to be assisted under joint schemes with the Commonwealth and Imperial governments&lt;BR /&gt;providing post-arrival services to nominated British migrants including their reception, transit accommodation, travel and aftercare (the care of migrants who had been sponsored by residents of the State was the responsibility of those who had nominated them)&lt;BR /&gt;reception, settlement and welfare services for non-assisted British and non-British immigrants upon request of the Commonwealth Government&lt;BR /&gt;financial assistance to voluntary organizations and community groups providing accommodation and other assistance to migrants (including the maintenance of children brought out under the Child Migration Scheme)&lt;BR /&gt;assisting in investigation of Community Refugee Settlement nominations.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;When assisted immigration from Britain resumed in 1947 it was the responsibility of the Chief Secretary (VRG 26), who from 1950 was also appointed Minister for Immigration (VRG 90). Between 1947 and 1950 the Chief Secretary was responsible for ensuring that the State's obligations under these agreements were met. Under the Minister for Immigration, a branch of the Chief Secretary's Department (VA 475), known as the State Immigration Office, had operational responsibility in this area until the establishment of the Immigration Division of the Department of State Development and Decentralisation (VA 552) in 1971.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In February 1977 the Ministry of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (VA 1042) assumed the responsibilities of the Immigration Division.  Although responsible to the Minister of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (VRG 68), the Ministry was located within the Department of State Development and Decentralisation (VA 552) between 1977 and 1978, and within the Department of State Development, Decentralisation and Tourism (VA 2881) from 1978 until 1981. In 1981 the Ministry gained full departmental independence.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Unassisted British Immigration 1975-1983&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The responsibilities of the State were expanded in June 1975, following a Ministers Conference at which it was agreed that the States would assume responsibility for the processing of applications lodged by British persons seeking unassisted entry into Australia in addition to the existing responsibility for all nominees seeking assisted passages from the United Kingdom. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Transfer of remaining immigration functions to the Commonwealth 1983&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The end of the State's role in immigration matters came in early 1983, when the Commonwealth took over the administration of both assisted and unassisted British sponsorship schemes and associated services.  This change had been anticipated by the appointment at the end of 1982 of a Minister for Ethnic Affairs (VRG 76) whose primary responsibilities related to providing services to ethnic communities, promoting good community relations and multiculturalism and the prevention of racial discrimination.&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In the 1880's the situation of the unemployed was a regular topic of discussion in Parliament. The initial response of the Government was to direct the Minister of Public Works and the Railway Commissioners to ascertain how they could provide employment in the carrying out of their contracts. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1892 a Labour Bureau was established in the Public Works Department "in order to meet the great depression" and "with a view of organizing the unemployed". The Labour Bureau undertook the registration of unemployed men and distribution of available government contract work. By 1896 the Labour Bureau was located within the Railway Department. In 1900 the Labour Bureau appears to have passed back to the Public Works Department. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Around this time the Railway Department issued free railway passes and the Mines Department issued free mining licences to men looking for mining work in country areas. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1911 the Labour Bureau was amalgamated with the Immigration Department (otherwise known as the Intelligence Bureau). The Immigration and Labour Bureau, within the Department of Crown Lands and Survey (VA 538), administered the British immigrant nomination scheme including the provision of reception, initial settlement and employment services to British immigrants, and co-ordination of overseas promotion and emigration assistance. It also undertook the registration and placement of unemployed Victorian workers although the Hansard for 1912 indicates that the placement of immigrants may have been given a higher priority. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1918 responsibility for the functions of the Immigration and Labour Bureau passed from the Minister for Lands (VRG 18) to the Minister for Labour (VRG 42) and hence to the administration of the Department of Labour I (VA 2874). Responsibility for immigration passed to the Minister of Immigration I (VRG 44) in 1923. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;From 1923 a Labour Exchange continued under the administration of the Minister of Labour. The Labour Exchange undertook the registration of unemployed persons for temporary or casual employment, principally as artisans and labourers, on Government works. The Exchange also undertook to supply workmen for  employment and advanced railway tickets to applicants who themselves obtained employment in country districts.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Government Labour Exchange closed in March 1942. It is evident that from this time the Commonwealth Manpower authorities assumed responsibility for employment as part of its wartime administration. Officers of the Labour Exchange transferred to the Commonwealth National Service Offices. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Trade Descriptions&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;From 1900 the Minister of Labour became responsible for administering legislative provisions regulating trade descriptions.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Factories and Shops Act 1896 introduced provisions requiring all Victorian-made furniture to be stamped. Furthermore, the furniture was to be stamped to indicate whether it was made by "European Labour" or by "Chinese Labour". This represented another legislative means of regulating competitive industry. Similar to the provisions requiring furniture factories employing Chinese to be registered, this provision was introduced to protect the non-Chinese furniture manufacturers from the competition of the Chinese tradesmen who would work longer hours and at lower rates of pay.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Footwear Regulation Act 1916 was proclaimed on 2 July 1917. This Act provided that a clear description of material used in footwear should be stamped or printed thereon. This legislation also aimed to protect manufacturers of leather footwear from competition by manufacturers using leather substitutes.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Pursuant to the Goods Act 1937 the Department of Labour became responsible for administering new provisions which required certain goods to be marked with trade descriptions as to their quality or purity. A further Act, the Goods (Textile Products) Act 1944 aimed to protect the woollen industry through the proper labelling and marking of textile fabrics with the proportion, by weight, of the various fibres in their constitution. The Goods (Textile Products) Act 1953, operative from 1 August 1954, prohibited the sale of textile products not labelled in the prescribed manner.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The regulation of trade descriptions gradually evolved into a consumer protection function. Administration of the Consumers Protection Act 1964 became a responsibility of the Minister of Labour and Industry in July 1968. It had previously been a responsibility of the Attorney-General (VRG 19). This Act provided for a consultative and advisory council - see consumer affairs consultation.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Consumer Protection Bureau was established pursuant to the Consumer Protection Act 1970, operative from 16 November 1970. The Consumer Protection Bureau was vested with the following functions:&lt;BR /&gt;		advising the public as to the provisions of the consumer protection legislation (and taking action to remedy infringements)&lt;BR /&gt;		inspections of the premises of retailers and manufacturers to ensure compliance with relevant Acts&lt;BR /&gt;		advising people generally on matters which affect their interests as consumers&lt;BR /&gt;		receiving complaints of illegal or unfair practices in relation to goods or services and, where appropriate, referring these complaints on to other Government agencies&lt;BR /&gt;		conducting research and gathering information on matters affecting the interests of consumers.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Complaints investigated were concerned with such matters as the servicing of electrical appliances, door to door sales practices, motor car sales and repairs, and false advertising. The Footwear Regulation Act 1970, operative from 1 January 1971, re-enacted (with amendments) earlier legislation intended to protect the consumer against cheap substitutes for leather, and also to protect the responsible manufacturer against unfair competition from such substitutes.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Consumer Protection Bureau assumed responsibility for the investigation and enforcement of the trade description provisions previously undertaken by the Department of Labour and Industry. The Consumer Protection Act 1972, operative from July 1972, gave legislative form to this arrangement by replacing the trade description provisions in the following legislation:&lt;BR /&gt;		Goods Act 1958, Part V (relating to Merchandise Marks)&lt;BR /&gt;		Footwear Regulation Act 1970&lt;BR /&gt;		Labour and Industry Act 1958, Part VII/7 (relating to Stamping of Furniture).&lt;BR /&gt;The passing of the 1972 Act reflected the change of focus of these provisions from the protection of certain industries against "unfair" competition to the protection of consumers.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1973 a Minister of Consumer Affairs (VRG 63) was commissioned for the first time and assumed responsibility for the consumer protection function from the Minister of Labour and Industry. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;A Ministry of Consumer Affairs was established under the Ministry of Consumer Affairs Act 1973 on 3 June 1974 to generally protect and promote the interests of consumers and to administer the Consumer Protection Act 1972. A Director of Consumer Affairs was appointed on 3 June 1974 and reported to the Permanent Head of the Department of Labour and Industry. The Ministry of Consumer Affairs and the Consumer Affairs Bureau (VA 2736), which replaced the Consumer Protection Bureau following proclamation of the Consumer Affairs Act 1974 on 1 January 1975, did not gain full independence from the Labour and Industry portfolio until 1981.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The functions of the Ministry were:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;	to protect and promote the interests of consumers&lt;BR /&gt;	to investigate any matter affecting such interests&lt;BR /&gt;	to advise and co-operate with government departments, statutory authorities and municipalities&lt;BR /&gt;	to initiate, promote and encourage practices for the protection of consumers&lt;BR /&gt;	to inform consumers of their rights and responsibilities&lt;BR /&gt;	to administer the Consumer Protection Act 1972&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Bureau's functions, as set out in the Consumer Protection Act 1972 (No. 2736) were: &lt;BR /&gt;	to provide advice to people in respect of matters affecting their interests as consumers&lt;BR /&gt;	to receive and investigate complaints&lt;BR /&gt;	to implement consumer education programmes&lt;BR /&gt;	to conduct research into consumer matters&lt;BR /&gt;	to initiate action for remedying breaches into legislation.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Although the Bureau operated as a unit within the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, it retained an independent identity.  Its functions were very closely related to those of the Ministry and the line of demarcation between the two is obscure.  However it appears that the Bureau was the contact point for members of the public approaching the Ministry with consumer queries or problems.  Accordingly, its prime function was to investigate and seek to resolve consumer complaints.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Following an administrative re-arrangement in 1983 the Consumer Affairs Bureau was abolished and its functions dispersed to various divisions of the Ministry of Consumer Affairs. The investigation of consumer complaints was administered by the Complaints and Claims Division of the Ministry of Consumer Affairs.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Office of Fair Trading succeeded the Ministry of Consumer Affairs following administrative arrangements introduced in October 1992. The Office administers a range of programs aimed at the achievement of fair market practices. It provides advice to the Government on consumer affairs issues, objectives, policies, priorities and implementation strategies. It acts as a consultant to other government agencies on matters relating to consumers and traders. The Office's services include the provision of advice, information, referral and dispute resolution in relation to consumer and residential tenancy matters.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Client Services Division of the Office is responsible for the Office's delivery of information, advisory, conciliation and adjudication programs. Through its branches the Division provides public inquiry and referral services, investigation and conciliation regarding complaints in consumer and tenancy matters, administrative support through the Adjudication Support branch to the Residential Tenancies, Small Claims and Credit Tribunals, maintains three regional offices, and provides general finance, administration and personnel services to the Office.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Development Division manages the Office's research and marketing strategies, public information and funding programs, and provides policy analysis and program review. The Division also provides support to the Prices Commissioner.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Legislation and Regulation Division is responsible for advising on and giving effect to the Office's legislative program and for providing legal and legal policy advice. The Division develops product safety and information standards and prevents the distribution of dangerous goods. It undertakes prosecutions of persons in breach of legislation assigned to the Minister for Fair Trading, contributes to self-regulation proposals and administers the Office's licensing functions.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Since proclamation of the Motor Car (Third Party Insurance) Act 1939 on 22 January 1941 owners of motor vehicles have been obliged to obtain accident insurance policies indemnifying them against any liability which may be incurred in respect of the death or injury of any person caused by or arising out of the use of such motor vehicle. The operation and administration of transport accident legislation which has evolved over time has been undertaken by a number of public and  bodies. Below is a summary of the evolution of the statutory transport accident compensation system.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;To 1941&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;A victim of a motor accident had the right to sue a negligent party at common law for damages.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The role of the Government was limited to the Courts which heard such cases.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;1941 to 1973&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Motor Car (Third Party Insurance) Act 1939 made it compulsory for the owner of a motor vehicle to obtain third party insurance. The State Motor Car Insurance Office was established under the Act to provide policies of third party insurance to protect motor vehicle owners from exploitation against  insurance companies. The Insurance Office was also able to provide general motor car insurance. The regulation of  motor accident insurance business was also provided for under the 1939 Act.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;1973 to 1986&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Motor Accidents Act 1973 introduced a 'no fault' motor accident compensation scheme. The 'no fault' scheme, the first of its type in Australia, was a fundamental departure from the law of tort (common law) and was based on the notion that such are the complexities and numbers of accidents in society, many of which are not related to negligence or fault, that payment of some compensation should be a social liability paid for by motor vehicle owners collectively. This 'no fault' strand of personal injury compensation complemented the common law component under which persons able to establish the negligence of a third party could sue for damages under the compulsory third party system which had prevailed since 22 January 1941. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Victorian Government's move to a "no fault" system of motor accident compensation was based on the recommendation of two committees, the first appointed to report on methods of reducing the time involved and the high costs of litigation procedures, and the second to draw up in draft detailed provisions for "no fault" benefits and administration.  The Motor Accidents Act 1973, which embraced most of the second committee's recommendations, received Royal Assent in April 1973. Its administrative provisions began to operate from 12 February 1974.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Administration of the 'no fault' scheme was vested in the Motor Accidents Board established in September 1973 under the 1973 Act. The Board's role involved the processing of compensation claims, including assessing the eligibility of injured persons for compensation under the Act and the provision of rehabilitation services.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The provision of third party insurance continued to be the responsibility of the State Motor Car Insurance Office which from 1975 was succeeded by the State Insurance Office. The State Insurance Office was from 1973 one of the two insurers remaining in the business. R.A.C.V. Insurance Pty. Ltd. was subsequently unable to continue and the State Insurance Office became the sole insurer from 1 January 1977. From this date the Office assumed responsibility for the administration of all common law claims which previously had been administered by the Insurance Office and authorised insurers. The State Insurance Office also became the Incorporated Nominal Defendant as the sole insurer. The liabilities of the Incorporated Nominal Defendant were previously met by authorised compulsory third party insurers in proportion to their share of the premium income.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;1987 to ct&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;During 1985/86 the Department of Management and Budget conducted a review of third party motor accident injury compensation.  The review culminated in the proclamation of the Transport Accident Act 1986 on 23 December 1986.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;A new transport injury compensation scheme was established under the Transport Accidents Act 1986 commencing 1 January 1987. The scheme covers injuries or death as a result of a transport accident including motor vehicle accidents or public transport accidents.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Transport Accidents Act 1986 introduced substantial limitations on the right to issue proceedings against a negligent party at common law for damages. Common law proceedings can only be brought in cases of death or serious injury.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Transport Accident Commission was established on 23 December 1986 as successor to the Motor Accidents Board. As well as being vested with responsibility for administering the new scheme the Commission assumed responsibility on 1 January 1987 for administration of the former compulsory third party scheme administered by both the Motor Accidents Board (for 'no fault') and the State Insurance Office (for common law). The Commission also assumed responsibility for administering claims against the Incorporated Nominal Defendant from the State Insurance Office.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Transport Accident Commission was established under the above Act to:&lt;BR /&gt;	manage the transport injury compensation scheme, extended to include victims of accidents involving trams and trains (formerly administered by the Metropolitan Transit and State Transport Authorities)&lt;BR /&gt;	ensure that appropriate compensation is delivered as quickly as possible&lt;BR /&gt;	ensure that accident prevention is emphasised and effective rehabilitation is achieved.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Originally the Commission was responsible to the Treasurer (VRG 23) but under an Administrative Arrangements Order of December 1987 responsibility was transferred to the Minister of Transport (VRG 49) on 1 January 1988.

The Electricity Commissioners were constituted in 1919 under the provisions of the Electricity Commissioners Act 1918 (No.2996) and became the State Electricity Commission of Victoria (S.E.C.) under the provisions of the State Electricity Commission Act 1920 (No.3104). 

The Electricity Commissioners assumed responsibility for the administration of the Electric Light and Power Act from the Public Works Department (VA 669).


Powers and Functions of the S.E.C.

The State Electricity Commission was required:

(	to inquire into and report to the Government on the measures which should be taken to achieve the ultimate  co-ordination and amalgamation of all electrical undertakings in Victoria, and to secure the efficient inter-connection of such undertakings by the adoption of necessary standards of plant and equipment and system frequency and pressure 
(	to encourage and promote the use of electricity for industrial and manufacturing purposes and to report to the Government on the prospects of establishing new industries requiring large quantities of electrical energy
(	to carry out investigations to ascertain the extent of coal deposits or of water power suitable for use in connection with the generation of electricity
(	to carry out investigations as to the safety and most economical means of improving the generation, distribution, supply and use of electricity throughout Victoria.

The Commission was vested with the following powers in relation to electrical undertakings; 

(	to construct, maintain and operate electrical undertakings
(	to supply electricity in bulk to any statutory corporation or undertaking such as municipalities
(	to supply electricity to any person outside any area in which there is an existing undertaking and to Government departments and institutions
(	to carry on any business associated with an electrical undertaking
(	to make regulations as to precautions to be adopted in the use of electricity and to arrange for the licensing of electric wiremen
(	to develop brown coal mining and briquette manufacture
(	to develop hydro-electric resources
(	to register contractors, control installation methods and materials, and
(	test and trade in approved electrical equipment and appliances.

The Commission was a self supporting business which financed its capital works program and met its operating expenses solely through revenue received from its customers and repayable loans.

Acquisition of Electrical Undertakings

The Commission gradually acquired a number of electrical undertakings previously owned by  companies, municipalities and the Victorian Railways.  Between 1922 and 1953 the Commission acquired control of the following undertakings:

(	North Melbourne Tramways and Lighting Company in 1922
(	Melbourne Electric Supply Company in 1930
(	The Electric Supply Company of Victoria in 1934
(	Newport B Power Station from Victorian Railways in 1939
(	Melbourne City Council Spencer Street Power Station in 1941
(	Newport A Power Station from Victorian Railways in 1951
(	Mildura Electrical Undertaking in 1953

The S.E.C. continued to provide bulk supply electricity to certain metropolitan municipalities which then supplied their customers.

Tramways

In 1930 the S.E.C. acquired the Geelong Tramways from the Melbourne Electric Supply Company and in 1934 the Commission acquired the Ballarat and Bendigo Tramways from the Electric Supply Company of Victoria.  The Commission continued to operate these tramways until 1956 and 1971\2 respectively.

Brown Coal Mining

In 1917 the Government had appointed a Brown Coal Advisory Committee to investigate and report on the commercial utilization of brown coal with particular reference to the generation of electricity.  In their annual report of 30 June 1920, the Commissioners reported that land had been acquired near Morwell and that progress had been made on the development of brown coal mining.   By 1921 open cut mining operations had commenced and by 1924 electricity was being generated from the Yallourn Power Station and supplied to Melbourne.

Yallourn

As part of its development of brown coal resources, the S.E.C. began building the township of Yallourn in the 1920's.  The Commission administered the town alone until 1947 when a Town Advisory Council was established.  In 1968 the S.E.C. decided to demolish the town to make way for further mining and, despite opposition, by 1982\3 the demolition was complete.

Hydro-Electric Schemes

One of the initial responsibilities of the Electricity Commissioners was to report on the feasibility of using water power for the generation of electricity.  Government approval for the Sugarloaf-Rubicon Scheme was given in 1922 and the Rubicon and Mt Sugarloaf hydro-electric stations were in service by 1928 and 1929 and the Eildon station by 1956.  Work on the Kiewa Scheme was not commenced until 1939 and the first power station was in operation by 1944.  A Commonwealth-State Conference on the use of the Snowy River was convened in 1946 and subsequently the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Authority was established in 1949.  The Snowy Mountain Hydro-Electric Agreements were ratified by Parliament in 1958 and electricity from the Snowy Scheme was first transmitted to Victoria in 1959.



Restructure

The Electricity Industry Act 1993 commenced the restructuring of the State Electricity Commission of Victoria with its disaggregation into three statutory business undertakings with independent chairmen.  These were:

Generation Victoria  the production of power to meet the energy requirements of the system.
National Electricity (further reconstituted as PowerNet Victoria by the Electricity Industry (Amendments) Act 1994)  high voltage transmission, the balancing of supply and demand and for security of supply across the system.
Electricity Services Victoria  low voltage distribution and the sale of electricity to retail customers.

The Office of the Administrator was established by the same Act to oversee this restructuring and continues (as at January 2001) to be responsible for all residual rights and obligations of the SECV not allocated to the disaggregated electricity entities.  These disaggregated entities were further disaggregated and sold to  owners.  The State Electricity Commission Act 1958 was repealed by further amendments to the Electricity Industry Act in 1998.</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Further research is required on the early development of the function. There would appear to be an early function which encompassed the storage of explosives for Government use. The dangerous goods function, however, focuses on the regulation of gunpowder and explosives whether stored and used by the Government or  businesses/persons.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Further research is required to determine when the function of managing public magazines ceased.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Importation and Custody of Gunpowder Statute 1864 and the Explosives Act 1877 provided for the appointment of public magazines or the licensing of  magazines for the storage of gunpowder. The function therefore initially encompassed both the management of the public magazines and the licensing and inspection of  magazines. This was one of the functions of the Department of Trade and Customs. In 1901 the function passed to the Chief Secretary's Department.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1965 the Explosives and Gas Examining Branch of the Chief Secretary's Department was transferred to the Mines Department. The Department of Minerals and Energy assumed responsibility in 1977 as successor to the Mines Department.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Ministry for Employment and Training inherited responsibility in July 1984 for the Explosives Act 1960, the Inflammable Liquids Act 1966, the Liquified Gases Act 1968 and the Liquified Petroleum Gas Act 1958 from the Department of Minerals and Energy. The administrative unit responsible to July 1984 was the Hazardous Materials Division of the Department of Minerals and Energy. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Dangerous Goods Act 1985, most of which was proclaimed on 1 October 1985, consolidated the law relating to explosives and other dangerous goods, and repealed the Liquid Fuel Act 1941, the Liquified Petroleum Gas Act 1958, the Explosives Act 1960, the Inflammable Liquids Act 1966, the Liquified Gases Act 1968, and the Dangerous Goods (Road Transport) Act 1984. A Dangerous Goods Branch was established in the Ministry of Employment and Training to assume responsibility for the dangerous goods function. Responsibility subsequently passed to the Minister for Employment and Industrial Affairs and the Minister for Labour.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In October 1992 responsibility was transferred to the Minister for Industry and Employment (VRG 116) and then to the Minister for Industry Services (VRG 108). The Chemicals and Plant Safety Division of the Department of Business and Employment (VA 3096) was responsible from October 1992 to 1996.  From 1996 administration of the Act has been the responsibility of the Victorian Workcover Authority.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background

In 1977, following the passing of the Minerals and Energy Act 1976, the Minister for Minerals and Energy became responsible for all functions of government previously administered by the Minister for Mines and the Department of Minerals and Energy

Consequently the prime functions of this, became:
   	to investigate the State's geological structure, mineral wealth and underground water resources,
   	to provide technical services and information to the mining industry
   	to supervise the safe working of mines, quarries, pipelines and onshore and offshore petroleum installations
   	to license mining activity and give financial assistance to the mining industry
   	to administer the Extractive Industries Advisory Committee
   	to provide scientific and geological advice to study groups established by the Land Conservation Council
   	to provide assistance to the Victorian Brown Coal Research and Development Committee and to the Victorian Solar Energy Research Committee.

In 1990 responsibility for all functions were acquired by the newly appointed Minister for Industry, Technology and Resources (VRG 82)

The Department of Manufacturing and Industry Development was established under Administrative Arrangements Order (No 82) 1990, effective from 18 December 1990.

This order created the new Department by renaming the Department of Industry and Office of Economic Planning (VA 3005).  As such the new Department assumed all of the functions of the previous agency.  Responsibility for the Department was vested with the Minister for Manufacturing and Industry Development.

This agency was abolished after the 1992 State election.  The energy and minerals function was transferred to VA 3035 Department of Energy and Minerals. The Department of Energy and Minerals was responsible for the development of Victoria's energy and mineral resources and the regulation of exploration and mining operations throughout the State.

The mission of the Minerals Group was to facilitate exploration and development of the State's mineral wealth for the benefit of all Victorians.  The Group was responsible for the administration  the Mineral Resources Development Act and Regulations which involves:

	ensuring exploration, development and mining operations are conducted in a safe manner (Mining Inspectorate)'
	administration of mining titles (Mining Tenements); 
	ensuring that mining activity is undertaken in an environmentally responsible manner (Environmental Unit);  and

The Minerals Group also administers the Extractive Industries Act and Regulations which involves the monitoring and control of exploration and extraction of construction materials such as sand, stone and clay.

Under Administrative Arrangements Order No.143, all functions of the Department of Energy and Minerals and the Department of Agriculture II (VA 3014) were assumed by the Department of Agriculture, Energy and Minerals (VA 3744) on 1 February 1995.

Following significant machinery of government changes after the re-election of the Kennett Government in April 1996, the Department of Agriculture, Energy and Minerals was abolished. Most functions were transferred to the new Department of Natural Resources and the Environment by Administrative Arrangements Order No.150.</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Melbourne and Metropolitan Tramways Board (M. &amp; M.T.B.) was established under the provisions of the Melbourne and Metropolitan Tramways Act 1918 (No.2995).  The Board was established to operate, control, manage and maintain all tramway undertakings and tramways constructed by, vested in, transferred to, or acquired by it.  The Board was authorised to construct and to complete the existing tramways.  By an order of the Governor-in-Council dated 22nd July 1919, the seven members of the Board, including a Chairman and a Deputy Chairman were appointed.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Under the provisions of a further Order-in-Council, the first meeting of the M. &amp; M.T.B. was held on 1 November 1919 and under the provisions of the Act, this was deemed to be the date on which the majority of the sections of the Act, came into operation.  The  M. &amp; M.T.B. was an independent statutory body which reported to the Minister of Public Works until 1952 and subsequently to the Minister of Transport.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The M. &amp; M.T.B. was given responsibility for the operation of all tramways within a sixteen kilometre radius of the General Post Office.  The only exceptions were the lines operated by the Victorian Railways.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Takeover of Existing Tramways&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The M. &amp; M.T.B. was deemed to be the successor of the Cable Tramway Board (VA 2693) and the Royal Park Horse Tramway.  These cable tramways (except the Northcote Cable Tramway, which was taken over on 20 February 1920) were taken over by the Board on 1 November 1919.  The assets and obligations of the following suburban tramways were transferred to the Board on 2 February 1920:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;   	Prahran and Malvern Tramways Trust (VA 2977)&lt;BR /&gt;   	Hawthorn Tramways Trust (VA 2978)&lt;BR /&gt;   	Melbourne, Brunswick and Coburg Tramways Trust (VA 2971)&lt;BR /&gt;   	Fitzroy, Northcote and Preston Tramways Trust (VA 2972)&lt;BR /&gt;   	Footscray Tramway Trust (VA 2973)&lt;BR /&gt;   	Northcote Municipality Cable Tramways (VA 520)&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Of the respective tramways taken over by the M. &amp; M.T.B. the Footscray and the Fitzroy, Northcote and Preston Tramways were only in the process of construction at the time the M. &amp; M.T.B. was established.  The construction of the Fitzroy, Northcote and Preston Tramways was completed on 1 April 1920 and the Footscray Tramways on 6 September 1921.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The M. &amp; M.T.B. did not take over the North Melbourne - Essendon Electric Tramways (VA 2974) at the time it took over the other suburban lines.  The Government eventually bought the Company's interest in both the lighting and tramways undertakings and transferred the tramway function to the Board by a subsequent Act (3247) which came into operation on 21 December 1922.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Administrative Structure&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Initially the various tramways and their administration were grouped into three systems as follows:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;   	Cable System&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;	(i)	Metropolitan Cable Tramways&lt;BR /&gt;	(ii)	Northcote Cable Tramways &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;   	Eastern System&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;	(i)	Prahran and Malvern Electric Tramways&lt;BR /&gt;	(ii)	Hawthorn Electric Tramways&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;   	Northern System&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;	(i)	Melbourne, Brunswick and Coburg Electric Tramways&lt;BR /&gt;	(ii)	Fitzroy, Northcote and Preston Electric Tramways&lt;BR /&gt;	(iii)	Footscray Electric Tramways&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1923 centralisation of the management of these systems resulted in all three systems being brought under the supervision of a traffic superintendent who was  responsible to a newly appointed manager for the operation of the combined system.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The accountancy departments of the three systems were amalgamated and transferred to the head office under the Secretary's Department.  The Secretary was the signatory to all the official correspondence of the Board.  The individual departments had to channel all their correspondence through the Secretary.  The Chairman of the Board occasionally handled some correspondence personally.  However, generally the Secretary handled all matters pertaining to the Board, drew up agenda for meetings, acted upon the decisions taken by the Board and negotiated on all property matters.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Engineer's Department was placed under a Chief Engineer (T.P. Strickland) on 1 October 1921.  The supervision of the permanent way, power Houses, power supply, rolling stock and buildings as well as the construction and conversion of cable tramways to electric traction was carried out by the Engineer's Department.   The Chief Engineer was responsible for all engineering matters eg, civil. mechanical, electrical, architectural, design, maintenance and construction work, all contracts concerning buses and trams and purchases of vehicles.  From 1939 to 1952 (from T.P. Strickland's retirement to the appointment of a new Chief Engineer) the officers in charge of each sub-department reported directly to the Chairman of the Board.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Development of Tramways&lt;BR /&gt;	&lt;BR /&gt;Under Section 34 of the Act, the Board was directed to prepare and adopt a "General Scheme" which was to provide a plan or framework upon which a systematic extension could be carried out, and to provide a basis for the future development of the tramways of the Metropolis.  The proposal envisaged a vast expansion of the tramway system with several new lines.  &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The proposals for the "General Scheme" were submitted to the Commissioner of Public Works and were referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Railways for consideration and report.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Melbourne and Metropolitan Tramways Board Act 1918 provided for the creation of an "Appeals Board" consisting of one representative appointed by the Board, one elected by the employees and an independent Chairman appointed by the Governor-in-Council.  The Appeals Board was established to hear appeals from employees' against dismissals, fines, deduction from wages, reduction in rank, grade or pay and other punishments inflicted' by the Board.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Introduction of Bus Services&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Following the proclamation of the Melbourne and Metropolitan Tramways Act 1923 (No.3308), the Board was empowered to operate omnibuses.  The Motor Omnibuses Acts of 1924 and 1925 removed competition on tramway routes.  The power conferred on the Board to operate buses was intended only to be subsidiary to its main function of tramway operations.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Parks and Gardens&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The M. &amp; M.T.B. was also empowered to purchase lands for use as parks or gardens.  Wattle Park was acquired as part of the tramway undertaking of the Board.  The Board took over the debenture liability on Wattle Park from the Hawthorn Tramways Trust and developed the park as a place of recreation.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Administrative Restructures 1952 and 1983&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Transport Act 1951 (No.5559) transferred responsibility for the administration of the Melbourne and Metropolitan Tramways to the Minister of Transport.  The Act came into operation on 14 March 1952.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Responsibility for the functions of the M. &amp; M.T.B. passed to the Metropolitan Transit Authority (VA 1044) in a major administrative restructure in 1983 with the passing of the new Transport Act 1983 (No.9921) which came into operation on 1 July 1983.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;An electric tramway system was inaugurated in Geelong when the Melbourne Electric Supply Co. opened a line to Newtown in March 1912. In Bendigo a tramway was opened in June 1890 by the Sandhurst and Eaglehawk Tramway Co. using cars driven by electric storage batteries. Steam motors were then introduced in 1892 under the new ownership of the Bendigo Tramway Co. In 1899 the system was acquired by the Electric Supply Co. of Victoria and in 1903 the line was electrified. In Ballarat a horse tramway was opened by the Ballarat Municipal Council in December 1887. In 1904 the lines were taken over by the Electric Supply Co. of Victoria which electrified the system between 1905 and 1913 (The Australian Encyclopaedia).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1930 the S.E.C. acquired the Geelong Tramways from the Melbourne Electric Supply Company and in 1934 the Commission acquired the Ballarat and Bendigo Tramways from the Electric Supply Company of Victoria.  The Commission continued to operate these tramways until 1956 and 1971/2 respectively.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;By 1910 it had become increasingly apparent that there was a need for a central roads authority to take over responsibility from the Board of Lands and Works (VA 744) for the care and management of the main roads of the state.  Up to this time there was a lack of co-operation between the agencies with operational responsibility for roads, the Roads and Bridges Branch of the Public Works Department (VA 669) and local municipalities, in the construction and maintenance of main roads.  Expenditure of State funds was without proper supervision and a thorough investigation into actual needs.  The absence of a systematic policy, as well as a lack of funds, had resulted in Victorian roads being in a deplorable condition.  At this time the increase in use of the motor car accentuated the demands for better roads.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;As a result of these needs the Country Roads Act 1912 (No. 2415) was proclaimed in 1913 providing for the establishment of the a central road authority with responsibility for those roads within the State considered to be main roads.  &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Functions of the Board&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Initial functions of the Board, as defined by the Act, were:&lt;BR /&gt;   	to ascertain which roads should be main roads,&lt;BR /&gt;   	to ascertain the most effective methods of road construction and maintenance, &lt;BR /&gt;   	to ascertain the deviations in existing roads or new roads which would facilitate communication and improve conditions for traffic.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;After an initial investigation by the Board construction guidelines were established and the letting of construction contracts, either directly by the Board or by municipal councils, proceeded by circa 1915.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Although the Country Roads Board was established in 1913 to co-ordinate the construction and maintenance of main roads and bridges the Public Works Department (VA 669), through its Roads and Bridges Section, continued to have a role in the construction of roads and bridges.  The final report of the Royal Commission on the State Public Service in 1917 indicates that the Public Works Department confined its operations chiefly to by-roads, tourist roads and special roads, although some overlapping with the Board could occur.  The report which made no mention of bridge construction by the Public Works Department, proposed the amalgamation of the Roads and Bridges Section with the Country Roads Board.  It is not clear exactly when the Public Works Department ceased to exercise any responsibility for road construction.  Therefore, despite the establishment of the Country Roads Board, the Board of Land and Works (VA 744) presumably continued to have some statutory responsibility for roads, and possibly bridges, until the Country Roads Board assumed full authority (by 1936?).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Extensions of Responsibilities&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;At various times other types of roads were proclaimed under legislation and subsequently came within the responsibility of the Country Roads Board.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Development Roads Act 1918 provided for the declaration of 'Developmental Roads', roads which would serve to develop any area of land by providing access to a railway station for primary producers.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Highways and Vehicles Act 1924 provided for the declaration of certain arterial roads as State Highways.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Tourists' Roads Act 1936 provided for the declaration of roads of sufficient interest or roads leading to tourist resorts or attractions as Tourists Roads. Construction of tourists roads had occurred prior to this on an ad hoc basis from at least 1917, through the Tourists Resorts Committee which functioned within the Department of Public Works (VA 669), however no provisions had existed for maintenance or improvement prior to this Act.  The Country Roads Board continued to have responsibility for tourists' roads until 1983 when it was succeeded by the Road Construction Authority (VA 1054).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Country Roads Act 1956 enabled the Board to construct by-pass roads which became popularly known as freeways.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Board also exercised some responsibility for other outer-metropolitan roads and, in conjunction with Municipal Councils, for unclassified roads.  Other functions of the Board have included:&lt;BR /&gt;   	inspection and supervision of the construction and maintenance of country bridges,&lt;BR /&gt;   	control of speed and weight of commercial goods vehicles,&lt;BR /&gt;   	licensing of country, commercial, passenger vehicles including touring and light motor omnibuses and prescription of routes, under the Motor Omnibus Acts (until 1934 when the Transport Regulation Board (VA 2738) inherited this responsibility),&lt;BR /&gt;   	collecting on behalf of the Traffic Commission, a body made up of representatives of agencies concerned with traffic management, data on road safety and traffic accidents (until 1971 when this function was inherited by the Road Safety and Traffic Authority (VA 487)).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Following an amendment to the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works Act in 1956 (No. 5982) the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works (VA 1007) was vested with responsibility for the construction and maintenance of proclaimed metropolitan bridges and main highways.  In July 1974 the Country Roads Board resumed responsibility for such roads and bridges under the provisions of the Metropolitan Bridges Highways and Foreshores Act 1974.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Decentralisation of Administration&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Increases in the Board's direct responsibilities and the necessity for the supervision and control of works entrusted to municipalities led the Board in 1926 to adopt a scheme of decentralization.  Over time the following ten regional divisions, each headed by a Divisional Engineer, were established: Bairnsdale, Ballarat, Benalla, Bendigo, Dandenong, Geelong, Horsham, Metropolitan, Traralgon and Warnambool.  At present only the Ballarat Division has been registered (VA 1021).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Restructuring of Transport Portfolio and Abolition of the Board 1983&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1982 the administration of the State's transport authorities began to undergo a significant transformation.  Under the provisions of the West Gate Bridge Authority (Transfer of Functions) Act 1982, proclaimed on 1 July 1982, responsibility for the functions of the Westgate Bridge Authority were transferred to the Country Roads Board.  The following year, on 30 June 1983, the Country Roads Board was succeeded by the Road Construction Authority (VA 1054) established under the provisions of the Transport Act 1983 (No.9921).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Until 1956 the Country Roads Board (VA 722) was responsible for the construction and maintenance of metropolitan roads and bridges.  Following an amendment to the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works Act in 1956 (No.5982) the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works (MMBW) (VA 1007) was vested with responsibility for the construction and maintenance of proclaimed metropolitan bridges and main highways.  From 1973 to 1974 the MMBW was responsible to the Minister for Planning in the exercise of this function.  In July 1974 the Minister for Transport (VRG 49) and the Country Roads Board resumed responsibility for such roads and bridges under the provisions of the Metropolitan Bridges Highways and Foreshores Act 1974.  This Act and its successor Act (the Transport Act 1983) returned the exercise of the function to the Country Roads Board and its successor agencies.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1933 an expert committee comprising the Director of Agriculture, the General Superintendent of Transportation and the Chief Engineer for Railway Construction was established to study and propose State action to provide for the economical and efficient bulk receipt, storage and transportation of grains in Victoria.  The recommendations of the committee resulted in the establishment of the Grain Elevators Board of Victoria in accordance with the provisions of the Grain Elevators Act 1934 (No.4269) &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Functions&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Under the legislation the Board was charged with responsibility for the acquisition and construction of country grain elevators and terminal elevators and the control and regulation of all grain handling.  The Board was responsible for all activities connected with the storage of grain, including weighing, issuing of warrants or receipts for grain delivered, supply management, quality control, pest control, and data collection. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt; The Grain Elevators Act 1958 (No.6266), which redefined the powers and authority of the Board, provided for the construction, maintenance and control of elevators by the Board within the State of New South Wales along the Yarrawonga-Oaklands, Echuca-Deniliquin and Barnes-Balranald railway lines.  In 1977, the Board became the sole grain handling authority in Victoria under the Act to amend the Grain Elevators Act 1958 (No.9010).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Board was appointed by and responsible to the Minister of Agriculture.  It was originally composed of a chairman with business experience, a representative of the Victorian Railway Commissioners or the Railway Construction Branch of the Board of Land and Works, and a representative of the grain growers.  The Board structure was later changed to provide for three grower members, one member of the Victorian Railways, one member of the Department of Agriculture, and an independent business person.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In order to fulfil its mandate, the Board appointed a General Manager and developed a corporate structure with divisions responsible for administration and the management of grain supply, elevator and facilities operations, and the construction and maintenance of elevators.  Apart from the Head Office functions in Melbourne, staff were distributed throughout the state at five regional offices and the two export terminals at Geelong and Portland, reporting to Head Office through the Operations Division.  In addition to its operation of elevators and grain management activities, the Board also became active in the provision of international consulting services in association with the Australian Wheat Board.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Grain Elevators Board was dissolved under the Grain Handling and Storage Act 1995 (No.45, 1995) and wound up operations on December 31, 1995.  Its assets were sold to a  operator, VicGrain Limited, which continued the key operating functions of the Board.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Office of the Auditor-General for the Colony of Victoria was established with separation from New South Wales in 1851.  With the abolition of the imprest system in 1855 the role of the Auditor-General was clearly delineated from that of the Treasurer (VRG 23). In 1857 the position of the Auditor-General was abolished and replaced by three Commissioners of Audit. The Audit Act 1901 re-established the Auditor-General. Administrative support for the Auditor-General was provided by the Audit Office and later by the Office of the Auditor-General, located administratively within the Chief Secretary's portfolio (VRG 26) from 1860 to 1936 and subsequently in the Premier's portfolio (VRG 50).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;As at 2001 the Auditor-General of Victoria is an independent Officer of the Parliament, appointed under legislation to examine the management of resources within the public sector. The Auditor -General is not subject to control or direction by the Parliament or the Government.  The Auditor -General undertakes a wide range of financial and performance audits.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Auditor-General's Office undertakes audits of:&lt;BR /&gt;	&lt;BR /&gt;Parliament &lt;BR /&gt;The States financial statements&lt;BR /&gt;Departments and independent budget sector agencies&lt;BR /&gt;Public bodies such as government business undertakings, commissions and   committees of management&lt;BR /&gt;Municipal councils and libraries&lt;BR /&gt;Educational institutions including universities&lt;BR /&gt;Public hospitals and ambulance services&lt;BR /&gt;Superannuation funds&lt;BR /&gt;Companies and joint ventures&lt;BR /&gt;Regional waste management groups&lt;BR /&gt;Cemetery  trusts and&lt;BR /&gt;Water Authorities&lt;BR /&gt; &lt;BR /&gt; &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Following separation from New South Wales and the establishment of the Crown Colony of Victoria, responsibility for the management of the colony's legal system including the administration of the courts was shared by two colonial officers, the Attorney General and the Solicitor General, both of whom were members of the Legislative Council.  The Attorney General was also a member of the Executive Council.  The practice of joint ministerial responsibility was continued after the achievement of responsible government in 1855 until 1951 when, under the provisions of the Solicitor General Act 1951 (No.5604) the office of the Solicitor General became non-ministerial and the Attorney General assumed responsibility for those functions previously administered by the Solicitor General. The function of the Solicitor-General, as stated in the 1951 Act, is to act as counsel for Her/His Majesty and other duties of counsel as directed by Attorney-General or as conferred by any Act.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Administrative Arrangements&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1985 Administrative Arrangements Order (No.38) transferred responsibility for the direction of duties of the Solicitor-General to the Premier (VRG 50) with effect from 11 October 1985.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Administrative Arrangements Order (No.114), dated 6 October 1992, subsequently transferred responsibility back to the Attorney-General (VRG 19).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Minister of Justice&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In some ministries during the period 1861 to 1891, the Solicitor General was known as the Minister of Justice.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background

Prior to the establishment of the National Parks Authority under the provisions of the National Parks Act 1956 (No.6023) a number of departments and public authorities including the Department of Crown Lands and Survey (VA 538), the Forests Commission (VA 534), the Soil Conservation Authority, the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission (VA 723), the MMBW (VA 1007), the State Electricity Commission (VA 1002) and the Public Works Department (VA 669) were responsible for aspects of the management and development of public reserves, tourist facilities and national parks.  Individual parks and reserves were often administered by local committees of management appointed under the provisions of the Land Acts or the Forests Acts or in some cases, directly by the Department of Crown Lands and Survey or the Forests Commission. 

For some years prior to the passing of the National Parks Act, the Victorian National Parks Association, (a grouping of field naturalists clubs, walking clubs, the National Fitness Council, the Youth Hostels Association and the Caravan Club of the Royal Automobile Club of Victoria), the Natural Resources Conservation League of Victoria and a number of other smaller societies had advocated greater co-operation in the management of national parks and recommended the establishment of a single authority. Following their representations, the State Development Committee was requested to investigate the matter and presented its report in November 1951. It was not until 1956 however that legislation was finalised.

The Act provided for the appointment of a National Parks Authority which consisted of the Premier who was to be the responsible minister, the Director of National Parks, representatives of many of the public authorities with responsibility in the area and representatives of interested organisations. The objects of the Act were to provide for the establishment and control of national parks;  to protect and preserve indigenous plant and animal wildlife and features of special scenic, scientific or historical interest;  to maintain the existing environment of national parks;  to provide for the education and enjoyment of visitors and to encourage and control such visitors. The National Parks Authority exercised its responsibilities in conjunction with other responsible departments and authorities and local committees of management. 

The National Parks (Amendment) Act 1971 transferred the statutory functions of the National Parks Authority to the Minister and the agency became known as the National Parks Service.

The National Parks Act 1975 introduced major changes to the administration of this function: the National Parks Service became responsible for parks other than "national parks" where intensive recreational usage occurred including ;  and the disbanding of Committees of Management which had managed thirteen of the then twenty-four national parks for many years. The Committees of Management were converted into Advisory Committees to the Director and the Service was given full responsibility for managing the parks. The new Act retained the concept of the traditional type of national park but, in addition, made provision for the management of other types of parks. This was required because the term "national park" had evolved a specific meaning and not all the parks historically designated "national parks" in Victoria would fit the International or Australian definitions of a national park. In this way management of various types of new parks (known as "other") such as those used primarily for wilderness, environmental education and outdoor recreation were included under the management of the national parks function. Park rangers, previously employed as exempt from the provisions of the Public Service Acts or employed directly by Committees of Management were now to be employed under the Public Service Act.

In 1983 the National Parks Service ceased to exist as a separate agency. Its functions were transferred to the newly formed Department of Conservation, Forests and Lands (VA 1034) of which it became a branch.

Some of the first national parks to be proclaimed were:

Wyperfield National Park (first reserved 1909 to preserve native fauna by permanently keeping the area in a primitive state) 

Kinglake National Park (first reserved 1928 for scenic features;  panoramic views and gullies)

Fern Tree Gully National Park (first reserved 1882 for scenic features)

Wilson's Promontory National Park (first reserved 1898 for preservation of native flora and fauna)

Mt.Buffalo National Park (first reserved 1898 for scenic features)

Sperm Whale Head National Park (first reserved 1927 as a sanctuary for fauna and the preservation of native flora)

Lind Park (first reserved 1926)

Alfred Park (first reserved 1925 as a beauty spot and for the preservation of native vegetation)

Wingan Inlet National Park (first reserved 1909 for historic reasons and for preservation of natural features)

Mallacoota Inlet National Park (first reserved 1909 for the provision of an animal sanctuary)

Tarra Valley National Park (first reserved 1909 for scenic features and preservation of native vegetation)

Bulga National Park (first reserved 1904 for scenic features and preservation of native vegetation)

Tower Hill National Park (first reserved 1866 for the preservation of a national monument, extinct volcano)

Six other important parks not reserved specifically as National Parks:

Buchan Caves National Park (first reserved 1916 for the preservation of caves;  administered by the Dept. of Lands and Survey (VA 538). An advisory committee of departmental officers is responsible to the Secretary for Lands for the management of the park. The curator and assistants are full-time officers of the Department.

Werribee Gorge (first reserved 1907 for the preservation of geological, volcanic and glacial features)

Churchill National Park (first reserved 1930)

Native Bear Sanctuaries, Phillip Island

Sir Colin Mackenzie Sanctuary (first reserved 1929).

The management (either directly or through co-ordination of Committees of Management) of national parks and from 1975 management directly of national parks, wilderness parks, and state parks is closely affiliated with the public lands management function - see 

Establishment of Parks Victoria

Parks Victoria was established under the Parks Victoria Act 1998.  This agency was formed by bringing together the management of the former National Parks Service and the former Melbourne Parks and Waterways.  It has become the primary agency for the management of National Parks proclaimed under the National Parks Act 1975</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;1900-1937&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The first inquiry into the condition of housing in Victoria was conducted in 1913 by a Select Committee of the Legislative Assembly. A report entitled Housing of the People in the Metropolis was subsequently published noting that the housing of the people in portions of the metropolis is most disgraceful andare a menace to the health and community at large. (Housing Investigation and Slum Abolition Board, First (Progress) Report, October 1937, pp.40-1)&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Over twenty years later in 1936 and 1937, there were small housing projects of an experimental nature in Port Melbourne and South Melbourne. The former was a State housing project while the latter was supervised by the South Melbourne City Council.(ibid p.41)&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;However it was not until 1937, with the formation of the Housing Investigation and Slum Abolition Board, that there was a coordinated attempt at dealing with the urgent necessity for measures to abate the slum menace. Extensive investigations into housing conditions generally throughout the State and particularly within Melbournes metropolitan area were conducted. The Boards report was such an indictment of the conditions under which a large section of the community was condemned to live, especially in the metropolitan area, that the Government immediately introduced a Housing Bill which was passed by Parliament in December 1937. The Act authorised the establishment of the Housing Commission. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Establishment of the Housing Commission&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Commission was appointed by the Government in March 1938 as a state run housing authority. The Commissions early activity was devoted to making recommendations for proposed legislation relating to slum clearance and re housing. Recommendations resulted in the Government proceeding a step further in its policy of housing reform with the passing, in the next session of Parliament (October 1938), of the Slum Reclamation and Housing Bill.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Housing Act 1937 and the Slum Reclamation and Housing Act 1938 established principles outlining the operations of the Commission. The main ones being:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The reclamation of insanitary housing areas.&lt;BR /&gt;The prescribing of minimum standards with which new houses must comply.&lt;BR /&gt;The improvement of existing housing conditions.&lt;BR /&gt;The carrying into effect of housing schemes including the&lt;BR /&gt;-acquisition of lands and&lt;BR /&gt;-construction of houses&lt;BR /&gt;The provision of homes for persons of limited means.&lt;BR /&gt;Rent regulation&lt;BR /&gt;Zoning- (dividing municipal districts into residential and other areas).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;From this early period until the 1970s emphasis was placed on clearing slum areas and re-housing people of limited means at the cheapest cost. However, the founding of the Housing Commission coincided with the onset of World War II. War conditions and the shortage of materials and manpower meant that the provision of public housing was slowed to a halt.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Appointment of the Chairman of the Housing Commission&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Slum Reclamation and Housing Act 1938 provided for the appointment of three full time members of the Housing Commission, by the Governor in Council. Of the three members of the Commission one was appointed Director of Housing and Chairman of the Commission. All other staff were employed under the Public Service Act.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Commission reported to the Treasurer (VRG 23) until 1945 when the first Minister of Housing (VRG 53) was appointed. Although the Commission was thereafter responsible to the Minister of Housing it remained administratively within the Treasury until 1973 when it became part of the new Ministry of Housing (VA 609) established under the Housing Ministry Act 1972.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;1943-1953&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Immediately after the War there was a huge demand for public housing. Houses were required in large numbers as quickly as possible to house those returning to civilian life and to catch up on the lag of construction over the war years. From 1945 funding was provided for public housing under the Commonwealth State Housing Agreement. This funding allowed for the Commission to build large estates of public housing (houses, units and multi-storey flats) in cleared areas in the inner region and in undeveloped areas on the outskirts of Melbourne. In 1946 the Commission set up a mass production program of prefabricated concrete houses at Homesglen.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In this period the first significant change to the public housing function occurred with the passing of the Housing Act 1943. This Act provided for eligible persons (persons of limited means who had been tenants of Housing Commission homes for three years), to purchase their home with a portion of their rental payments to be considered as a deposit. (Victorian Parliamentary Papers, Session 1942-3, Volume 213, pp.1219-1220) Eligible people were further allowed to purchase land and consequently erect a house.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Widening of the Powers of the Housing Commission&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In an effort to limit the inconvenience and to inculcate a community spirit, the Housing Act 1953 widened the powers of the Commission to enable it to cope with the planning requirements of large estates. It was able to erect shops, schools, halls and such other buildings that were deemed necessary in public housing settlements. (Victorian Parliamentary Debates, Session 1952-53, Volume 242, p. 2052) The Commission was given additional powers to carry out road making and the installation of sewerage, electricity and gas supplies. The Act further granted the Commission certain powers relating to planning in association with municipal authorities.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Housing (Broadmeadows) Act 1956 expanded the Commissions powers in creating zones for specific purposes. The Commission was able to sell land to  enterprises for the erection of industrial buildings so as to provide opportunities of employment for at least a portion of the residents housed in the nearby public housing estate. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;During this period the decision to concentrate on slum reclamation work was made once again. (Housing Commission, Annual Report, 1971) &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Consolidation of Public Housing Legislation 1958&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1958, previous legislation concerning public housing was consolidated in the Housing Act 1958. The Housing Commission continued to be responsible for the administration of all aspects of the public housing function.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Aboriginal Public Housing&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Aborigines (Houses) Act 1959 provided for the Housing Commission to enter into contracts to build houses for Aborigines on behalf of the Aborigines Welfare Board. This responsibility passed to the Ministry for Aboriginal Affairs (VA 2873) in 1968. In 1975 the Commission resumed responsibility for housing for Aborigines when the Ministry of Aboriginal Affairs was abolished.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Transfer of functions to the Ministry of Housing 1972-1983&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;By the 1970s many statutory housing bodies had been established. The Housing Ministry Act 1972 established a Ministry of Housing to coordinate the activities of the government in the housing field. The Ministry of Housing took over from the Commission responsibility for central coordination of the public housing function. The Ministry assumed responsibility for:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The improvement of housing conditions.&lt;BR /&gt;The provision of adequate and suitable houses for letting or purchase to persons of limited means or living under unsatisfactory housing conditions.&lt;BR /&gt;The coordination of the supply and renewal of public housing&lt;BR /&gt;Assisting in the provision of finance for persons building, purchasing or renovating houses.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Housing Commission continued to exist as a statutory authority, responsible for the following aspects of the housing function until it was abolished in 1983:&lt;BR /&gt;The Ministrys purchase and construction program&lt;BR /&gt;The allocation of housing funds&lt;BR /&gt;General tenancy arrangements&lt;BR /&gt;House sales&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;However, implementation of policy was undertaken by the Ministry.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;From the 1970s the emphasis of the public housing function shifted from slum clearance to providing financial assistance and information to home buyers and renovators. Managing housing assistance programmes, community managed housing and  rental were also priorities of those managing the public housing functions.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Housing (Amendment) Act 1978&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1977 the Government appointed management consultants to review the senior management organisation of the Ministry of Housing and its constituent agencies. As a result of this report the Housing Ministry Act 1972 was repealed and the Housing Act 1958 amended by the Housing (Amendment) Act 1978 to provide for a reconstituted Ministry of Housing consisting of a Minister of Housing, Director of Housing and other officers as necessary. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The legislation also established a Housing Advisory Council:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;To advise the Minister on matters affecting housing in the  or public sector&lt;BR /&gt;To investigate any matters affecting housing&lt;BR /&gt;To consult with the housing industry&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The council consisted of the Director of Housing and six part-time members appointed by the Minister.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Housing Act 1983 &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;As the previous housing acts were deemed to contain many provisions that were archaic or unnecessarily detailed and restrictive, the Housing Act 1983 was proclaimed. (Victorian Parliamentary Papers, Session 1983, Volume 366, Assembly, pp.1017-8). These legislative changes put increased emphasis on cost effectiveness and public accountability as well as growing involvement of the community in management and decision making.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Act abolished the Housing Commission, the Housing Advisory Council and the Home Finance Trust, and restructured the Ministry to provide for a stronger co-ordination and management of housing policy programs in Victoria.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Act came into effect on 1 January 1984, its objectives being:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;To ensure that every person in Victoria has adequate and appropriate housing at a price within his/her means by encouraging;  &lt;BR /&gt;i/. the provision of well maintained public housing of suitable quality and location.&lt;BR /&gt;ii/.the distribution, according to need, of Government financial assistance;  and &lt;BR /&gt;iii/.the promotion of the orderly planning, assembly and development of land;  &lt;BR /&gt;To expand and develop the role of the public sector in the provision of housing.&lt;BR /&gt;To promote cost effectiveness in the provision of housing&lt;BR /&gt;To promote the integration of public and  housing&lt;BR /&gt;To provide in the public sector a variety of housing types in different locations&lt;BR /&gt;To promote security and variety of tenure&lt;BR /&gt;To seek the participation of tenants and other community groups in the management of public housing and rental housing co-operatives; &lt;BR /&gt;To promote consultation on major housing policy issues with all persons and groups of persons involved in housing&lt;BR /&gt;To coordinate the provision of all necessary community services and amenities ancillary to public housing&lt;BR /&gt;To formulate and maintain standards of habitation throughout the State&lt;BR /&gt;To give due regard to the environmental impact of the activities of the public housing sector.&lt;BR /&gt;To promote public awareness of the role and functions of the public housing sector. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The public housing function also encompassed the provision of emergency assistance to low-income households experiencing a housing crisis.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Further restructuring&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;As part of the machinery of government change in December 1987, the Ministry of Housing was replaced by the Ministry of Housing and Construction (VA 2907) which also assumed responsibility for the functions of the Public Works Department (VA 669).... truncated</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Police Magistrate and Protectorate to 1849&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The first Police Magistrate for the Port Phillip District, William Lonsdale, was responsible to the Governor of New South Wales for the general administration of government in the District.  He also undertook the normal duties of a New South Wales District Police Magistrate relating to supervision of the local constabulary, the administration of justice and liquor licensing.  His civil instruction of 14 September 1836 from the New South Wales Colonial Secretary (Historical Records of Victoria, Volume 1, pp.49-54) set out his duties, including a census of the population and "protection of Aborigines":&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;	It will be one of your most important duties to protect the Aboriginal natives of the District from any manner of wrong, and to endeavour to conciliate them by kind treatment and presents... ..and to improve by all practicable means their moral and social condition.  &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;William Buckley was to be employed "as the medium of communication with them" (p.53).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Lonsdale's instructions included directions to investigate earlier violence and killings.  As settlement encroached further into tribal land, attacks by dispossessed Aborigines, counter-attacks and killings became more frequent.  Attempts by Lonsdale, his military forces and constabulary to deal with the situation were ineffective.  In the meantime in Britain a House of Commons Select Committee on Aborigines (1835-1837) was established (extracts from its final report of 26 June 1837 are included in Historical Records of Victoria, Volume 2A, pp.62-69) and the British Government, advised by Sir George Arthur, devised the Protectorate Scheme.  General questions about policies to be adopted towards the Aborigines were debated in London, Sydney and Melbourne, while in reality local officials were unable to deal with the appalling effects of colonisation on the Aboriginal population and the Aborigines were frequently subjected to brutal treatment by their would-be "protectors".&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;During the period 1836 to 1839 several abortive attempts were made to establish a Native Police Corps - from October 1837 to early 1839 under C.L.J. Villiers and in late 1839 under the Chief Protector.  A Government Mission under the control of the Anglican George Langhorne was located on the south bank of the Yarra from early 1837 to October 1839.  (For details see Historical Records of Victoria, Volumes 2A and 2B).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Chief Protector George Robinson and three assistants were appointed in late 1838 arriving in Port Phillip in early 1839 to establish a Protectorate there (NSW Government Gazette, 12 December 1838 (VA 512)).  Lonsdale was advised that he had no authority over Robinson, who reported directly to Governor Gipps and the Colonial Secretary in Sydney, except for the exercise of control over matters of expenditure and to supply provisions (Colonial Secretary to Lonsdale, 11 December 1838, Historical Records of Victoria, Volume 2B,p.391).  Robinson proceeded to allot districts to his Assistants and to issue directions relating to a census of the Aboriginal population, to a rationing and supply system, and to the maintenance of order and the control of disease (Historical Records of Victoria, Volume 2B, pp.451-452).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Guardian of Aborigines 1849-1860&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Guardian of Aborigines (VA 513) was appointed in 1849 following a Select Committee report which recommended the abolition of the Protectorate System.  The Guardian was solely responsible for providing "protection to Aborigines".  Crown Land Commissioners had been appointed as honourary protectors, their duties being to visit reserves, report on the condition of Aborigines and supply Aborigines with food and clothing "in cases of extreme emergency" (see VRG 27 District Land Offices).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Central Board 1860-1869 and the Board for the Protection of Aborigines 1869-1957&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Following a report by a further Select Committee established to inquire into Aboriginal welfare, the Central Board for the Protection of Aborigines (VA 514) was established in 1860.  The new Board set up "native reserves" (stations) and supply depots throughout Victoria.  In 1869 the Board was renamed the Board for the Protection of Aborigines (VA 515) and received statutory authority by an Act of Parliament entitled An Act to provide for the Protection and Management of the Aboriginal Natives of Victoria 11 November 1869, (No.CCCXLIX).  The provisions of the Act regulated people defined by the Act as "Aboriginal natives", "Aboriginal half-caste", and "half-caste infants".  The Board at this time was said to be concerned primarily with the "protection" of Aboriginal people as defined in the Act from the "evils" of European society such as drinking, as well as with the provision of clothing and food at stations and depots, and the provision of education to Aboriginal children.  Under the provisions of the Act the Board had extensive powers to control and regulate the classes of people defined in the Act.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;It could:&lt;BR /&gt;- regulate and prescribe places where Aborigines and Aboriginal tribes could reside&lt;BR /&gt;- prescribe the terms under which contracts were made for and on behalf of Aborigines&lt;BR /&gt;- prescribe the terms under which certificates could be granted to Aborigines who could earn a living&lt;BR /&gt;- distribute the earnings of any Aborigine or any produce resulting from Aboriginal labour on reserves&lt;BR /&gt;- distribute money granted by parliament&lt;BR /&gt;- regulate and provide care, custody and education for Aboriginal children.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Aboriginal Affairs Legislation 1886-1957&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;During this period Aboriginal mortality rates increased and a Royal Commission was appointed to investigate this and allegations of mismanagement at stations.  The resulting Aborigines Protection Act 1886 (No.DCCCCXII) re-defined the Board's responsibilities and functions.  Aboriginal people classified as "half-caste" were increasing in number and were seen as incurring added expenditure.  Therefore the Act re-classified Aboriginal people as "Aboriginal natives", "half-castes" associated and living with "Aboriginal natives" over 34 years of age, "female half-castes" either married or previously married to "Aboriginal natives" and still living with "Aboriginal natives", children of "Aboriginal natives", and any other "half-castes" holding licenses from the Board allowing them to reside where "Aboriginal natives" were living.  Under this Act "half-castes" were entitled to receive limited benefits and had to be licensed in order to reside with "Aboriginal natives".  The Board had the power, under direction from the Governor, to make and enforce regulations concerning "half-castes".&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Aboriginal people living on stations during this time were expected to work hard, for little return, in an attempt to curb the costs associated with maintaining the stations.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1890 the Aborigines Act (No.1059) gave the Board further powers to license "half-caste" children, enter "half-caste" children into apprenticeships and transfer "half-caste" orphans into care.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Aborigines Act 1910 (No.2255) gave the Board power, if it thought appropriate, to extend the regulations of the Act to cover "half-caste Aboriginals", the Chief Secretary having claimed that the costs would not greatly increase if "half-caste Aboriginals" were included.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Aborigines' Welfare Board 1957-1967&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1957 the Board for the Protection of Aborigines was abolished under the Aborigines Act 1957 (No.6086). It was replaced by the Aborigines' Welfare Board which consisted of the Chief Secretary, the Under-Secretary, the Ministers of Education (VRG 35), Health (VRG 39) and Housing (VRG 53) and five other members, two of whom were to be Aborigines.  A Superintendent of Aborigines was also appointed.  The Board's functions were to "promote the moral, intellectual and physical welfare of Aborigines (including persons of Aboriginal descent) with a view to their assimilation into the general community".  The powers of the Board were to:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;- prescribe the distribution of money&lt;BR /&gt;- provide for the supply of clothing, medicine and rations&lt;BR /&gt;- manage and regulate Aboriginal reserves&lt;BR /&gt;- purchase, build or acquire buildings and land, and grant licenses to occupy land or buildings to Aborigines&lt;BR /&gt;- generally supervise matters concerning the interests and welfare of Aborigines.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Act also prescribed conditions of employment and the issuing of permits to reside on reserves.  In 1959 the Aborigines (Houses) Act 1959 (No.6498) provided for the Housing Commission (VA 508) to enter into contracts to build houses for Aborigines on behalf of the Board&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Post 1967: Changing Focus of Aboriginal Affairs Policy&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Prior to 1967, although Aborigines were recognised as Australian citizens under the Commonwealth Nationality and Citizenship Act 1948 - and before that as British nationals, the special laws passed by State legislatures, including Victoria, with the expressed purpose of "protection", in effect denied  Aborigines the vote, required large numbers of them to live on reservations, and gave the agencies responsible for managing their affairs considerable powers to regulate and control their children, property, earnings and employment.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;From the late 1950's there was increasing concern in Australia and internationally about policies and programs relating to Aborigines and their legal status, resulting in rapid changes in related legislation, policies and administrative arrangements.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1967 a referendum extended voting rights to Aborigines and authorised a change to the federal Constitution (in particular sections 51 and 127 which had largely excluded Aborigines from federal jurisdiction).  By the mid-1970's these changes had resulted in the Commonwealth taking over primary responsibility for policy and programs for Aborigines from the States.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In Victoria prior to 1966 responsibility for the administration of policy and programs relating to Aborigines was vested in the Chief Secretary (VRG 26).  Administration of the function was undertaken by the Aborigines Welfare Board within the Chief Secretary's Department (VA 475) until 1968, when a Ministry of Aboriginal Affairs (VA 2873) was established under the provisions of the Aboriginal Affairs Act 1967 (No.7571).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1966, under the provisions of the Aborigines (Amendment) Act 1965 (No.7267) the Minister of Housing (VRG 53) succeeded the Chief Secretary (VRG 26) as the Minister responsible for Aboriginal affairs.  However the staff of the Aborigines Welfare Board remained within the Chief Secretary's Department (VA 475).  The appointment of a Minister of Aboriginal Affairs in December 1967 reflected the beginning of a new policy direction in Victoria in regard to matters relating to Aborigines, and a move away from the earlier policy of assimilation, which dated from the late 1950's.  The stated aim of the new policy was creation of opportunities for Aborigines to take responsibility for their own affairs.  The Minister's responsibilities involved "promoting the social and economic advancement of Aborigines in Victoria".&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Minister was deemed responsible for:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;- assisting Aborigines to obtain suitable housing and accommodation&lt;BR /&gt;- providing educational assistance, health and medical care, implements and tools of trade, employment and training, rehabilitation, legal aid and advice to Aborigines&lt;BR /&gt;- providing training farms and other educational institutions&lt;BR /&gt;- purchasing and acquiring land for use or benefit to Aboriginal people&lt;BR /&gt;- construction of houses and buildings for use by Aboriginal people&lt;BR /&gt;- making loans to enable A... truncated</description>

       <description type="full">Background

Soil erosion was noticed in Victoria as early as the 1850s and sand drift in the Mallee district was mentioned at a Royal Commission in the in the 1870s. For many years however, little interest was shown in the matter, since damage to lands in the settled districts was not widespread. As settlement developed and the cumulative effects of land exploitation began to be felt, soil erosion in various forms increased rapidly. In 1887, a committee of inquiry was formed to examine problems of river siltation arising from mining operations. This resulted in the formation of a Sludge Abatement Board in 1905. Severe floods in the 1890s started erosion on the banks of several Victorian rivers. In 1917, the more obvious forms of gully and stream erosion were investigated, and the Minister for Public Works called for the setting up of an Erosion Enquiry Committee which resulted in the formation of a River Erosion and Flood Protection Branch of the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission. Subsequently in the 1920s erosion in water catchments and the siltation of reservoirs were of considerable concern. Wind erosion and drifting sand were made more evident by new settlement in the Mallee district and by a succession of dry years, and in 1930 a Sand Drift Central Committee was formed which presented a report on erosion in 1933. 

The Victorian Department of Agriculture conducted experiments on the control of wind erosion and sand drift at the Mallee research station at Walpeup and the Public Works Department undertook the control of coastal erosion. In 1937 the Government appointed a committee to inquire into the incidence and gravity of soil erosion in the State;  its report was presented in 1938 and drew attention to widespread damage, not only in the hill catchments and in the Mallee, but also in many other farming areas. 

In 1940 the Soil Conservation Act was passed and the Soil Conservation Board (later Authority) was formed;  subsequently regional advisory committees were appointed and a number of demonstration and experimental areas were established. The Board's functions were principally research, advice an co-ordination of the activities of government departments insofar as they affected soil conservation.

The Premier took a prime role in the sponsorship of soil conservation from the late 1930's until a Minister for Conservation (VRG 55) was appointed in 1949.  The staff of the Soil Conservation Board/Authority, established in 1940 by the Soil Conservation Act (No.4786), continued to be located within the Premier's Department (VA 2717) until they were transferred to the Ministry for Conservation (VA 551) in 1973.

From 1940 staff of the Soil Conservation Board, later the Soil Conservation Authority (VA 1056), were located in the Department, although from 1949 they reported to the Minister for Conservation (VRG 55).  Responsibility was transferred to the Ministry for Conservation (VA 551) in 1973.

In 1945, a Bogong High Plains Committee was established and in 1946 a Royal Commission was held into the grazing of forests. This led to the passing of the Soil Conservation and Land Utilisation Act 1947 and the formation of the Land Conservation Authority, which in 1950 became the Soil Conservation Authority. The major difference between the Authority and the old Board lay in the Authority's power to direct land owners to remedy erosion, to impose conditions on the use of land to prevent erosion and to regulate the use of land in catchments. 
The Land Utilisation Advisory Council, which was also established in 1950 under this legislation, had responsibility for defining catchment areas and advising the Minister and the Soil Conservation Authority on land use in any catchment area.  

From 1984 the policy, planning and operational responsibilities of the Soil Conservation Authority were carried out by the Department of Conservation, Forests and Lands. In 1987 the Soil Conservation Authority was abolished and responsibility for the statutory provisions of the Soil Conservation and Land Utilisation Act 1958 (No.6372) were transferred to the Secretary of the Department and the Minister.

New Legislation

In 1994 the Catchment and Land Protection Act was passed, establishing the Victorian Catchment and Land Protection Council to advise the Minister on matters relating to catchment and land protection.  Victoria was divided into ten regions, each with a regional board with the principal task of developing regional catchment management strategies which would address the key land and water degradation issues in each of these regions.

The Council was reconstituted in 1997 as a statutory authority and renamed the Victorian Catchment Management Council.  At the same time the Soil Conservation and Utilisation Act 1958 was repealed by the Environment Conservation Council Act 1997 with the Land Conservation Council being replaced by the Environment Conservation Council.</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;From 1858-1861 this function encompassed the establishment of the zoological gardens and their administration by the Director of Zoological Gardens who reported to the Melbourne Zoological Gardens Committee which in itself reported to and was funded by the Chief Secretary (VA 475). In July 1858 the Government appointed a Committee for the Management of the Zoological Gardens. Baron Von Mueller, the Government Botanist and Director of the Botanical Gardens from 1857 was appointed to the Committee and was a little later appointed to the position of Director of Zoological Gardens. In October 1858 the Zoological Gardens were "combined" with the Botanic Gardens and it was agreed that the Government Botanist "should exercise control over the whole of the grounds and that he should only in the management of the Zoological Department be under the control of the committee..."[VPRS 1189/P, unit 745, file 58/G8503, Director of Zoological Gardens to Chief Secretary] In 1861 when the animals were moved from the Botanic Gardens to the present site in Royal Park it would seem that the Society once again took over administration of the Zoological Gardens but further research is required to absolutely verify this.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Researchers are advised to check the records of both the Chief Secretary and the Royal Zoological and Acclimatisation Society of Victoria (VA 3123) for the period 1857-1861. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Melbourne Zoological Gardens were the first to be established in Australia. In October 1857 the Zoological Society of Victoria was formed with the aim of the introduction and acclimatisation of animals, birds, fishes, and plants, both useful and ornamental. The first collections were housed in the Richmond Paddock opposite the Melbourne Botanic Garden. In 1861 the title was changed to the "Acclimatisation Society of Victoria", in 1870 to the "Zoological and Acclimatisation Society of Victoria", the prefix "Royal" being added in 1910. The animals were transferred to the present site in Royal Park in 1861. Although acclimatisation was one of the objects during the first decade at Royal Park, the efforts of the Society were gradually directed towards developing the Gardens and acquiring animals for exhibition purposes.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Royal Zoological and Acclimatisation Society of Victoria controlled the Zoological Gardens until 1937 when financial difficulties were encountered and the Society requested the Victorian Government to assume responsibility for the Zoological Gardens and its extensive collections. As a result the Zoological Gardens Act 1936 appointed the Zoological Board of Victoria, a statutory body, on which the society was represented until its final disbandment in the 1950s. The functions administered under the Zoological Gardens Act 1936 and subsequently the Zoological Parks and Gardens Act 1967 were:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;	responsibility for the Royal Melbourne Zoological Gardens;  &lt;BR /&gt;	from 1975 the Werribee Fauna/Zoological Park and &lt;BR /&gt;	from 1978 the Sir Colin Mackenzie Fauna Park (Healesville Sanctuary) &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;including:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;	the exhibition of zoological specimens to the public&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;	the scientific study of zoological specimens &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;	the instruction and entertainment of the public&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;	the protection, preservation, management and care of the wildlife&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt; the protection or preservation of the wildlife habitat including native plants and trees&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Replacement of the Zoological Board of Victoria&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Zoological Parks and Gardens Act 1967 was repealed by the Zoological Parks and Gardens Act 1995 with the Zoological Board of Victoria being replaced by the Zoological Parks and Gardens Board Victoria.  This new Board consists of nine members appointed by the Governor in Council on the recommendation of the Minister.  One member is to be a representative of the Department with others to be selected for their expertise in areas such as zoology or veterinary science, business management , tourism and nature conservation or animal research.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Board is responsible for the Royal Melbourne Zoological Gardens, the Healesville Sanctuary, Coranderrk Bushland at Healesville and the Victorian Open Range Zoo at Werribee.  Its functions include:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;the conservation, protection, management and improvement of the zoological parks and collections; &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;the promotion and increase of public enjoyment, knowledge and awareness of thwe zoological collections and parks; &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;the carrying out and promotion of zoological research; &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;the conservation of wildlife and its natural habitat; &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;the maintenance of biodiversity.&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background

By the late 1960s considerable public dissatisfaction was evident concerning the government machinery available to deal with environmental affairs. Prior to this pollution control responsibilities were spread among numerous State and local government agencies.

Prior legislation relating to air quality control included:

Clean Air Act 1958 and Regulations 1965 which create offences with respect to the emission of air impurities from chimneys etc and contained provisions of a regulatory nature, were administered by the Department of Health (VA 695)

Health Act 1958 sections 40-44 and section 101 provide a remedy in the form of abatement with respect to all forms of nuisances and was administered by the Department of Health (VA 695)

Summary Offences Act 1966 section 4 made it an offence to burn rubbish in a public place and the Motor Car Act 1958 section 83 made it an offence to emit excessive smoke, noise or smell from motor cars. The Motor car (Air Pollution) Regulations 1967 made provision for motor cars other than motor cycles to be so constructed as to prevent the escape of crank-case gases. The Motor Car (Design Rules) limited the carbon monoxide discharges during idling. All of these acts and regulations were administered by the Victoria Police (VA 724)

Country Fire Authority Act 1958 section 49 provided for the destruction by burning of certain industrial wastes and was administered by the Country Fire Authority (VA 482).

Arimal Spraying Control Act 1966 section 4 provided for the licensing of crop dusters and was administered by the Department of Agriculture (VA 618).

Extractive Industies Act 1966 and Extractive Industries General Operating Regulations 1968 under regulations 2401-2404 inspectors of the Department of Mines (VA 612) were empowered to serve notices where dust or toxic fumes created a health hazard or a nuisance.

Prior legislation relating to water quality control included:

Navigable Waters (Oil Pollution) Act 1960 related only to the discharge of oil into navigable waters. Owner or master of vessal, occupier of place on land or person in charge of apparatus from which oil is discharged may be liable. The Marine Act 1958 section 10 and Harbour Boards Act 1958 made it an offence to throw rubbish into Port Phillip and any other ports. These acts were administered by the Department of Public Works (VA 669).

Water Act 1958 provided for offences to pollute water-courses and reservoirs and to discharge saline matter into water courses and was administered by the Department of State Rivers and Water Supply (VA 723).

Fisheries Act 1968 provided for offences to poison water containing fish and was administered by the Fisheries and Wildlife Section of the Chief Secretary's Department (VA 475).

Environment Protection Authority

The Environment Protection Authority was constituted under the Environment Protection Act 1970 and came into being on 1 July 1971 although the bulk of the Act, enabling it to carry out its functions, was not proclaimed until 1 March 1973.  The Authority was established to act as the central pollution control agency in Victoria.  Pollution control had previously been the responsibility of a number of state and local government agencies. 

Section 13 of the Act set out seventeen powers, duties and functions. The first two established the Authority's broad objectives;  

	to administer the Act and to be responsible for and co-ordinate all activities relating to the discharge of wastes, the prevention and control of pollution and the protection and improvement of the environment. The Authority stated its aim as "to protect and improve the air, land and water environments for the people of Victoria through management of wastes, control of noise and prevention of pollution".

This encompasses:

	atmospheric emissions
	litter
	noise
	pollution
	threats to air quality
	threats to water quality
	waste

The remaining fifteen functions in Section 13 set out specific activities. These include: 

	the issuing of licenses to control the volume, type, constituents and effects of waste, emissions, deposits and other pollutants.

	the specification of standards and criteria for the protection and maintenance of the quality of the environment including the taking of samples and regular testing and monitoring;  

	investigation to ensure compliance of the Act including the enforcement of conditions of licensed discharges, the detection of unlicensed discharges and the investigation of reports and complaints concerning pollution;  
	the submission of Environmental Protection Policies to the Governor in

Council. These policies aim to identify an area and segment of the environment which has been subjected to despoliation (eg the waters of Port Phillip Bay), to set out the beneficial uses of that segment and to establish criteria and standards which must be achieved in order to ensure the continuation of those beneficial uses;</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The maritime and historic archaeology function encompasses the location, recording and protection of shipwrecks/maritime archaeology and post European settlement archaeological relics under the provisions of both State and Commonwealth legislation. The Aboriginal archaeology function encompasses the location, recording and protection of aboriginal prehistory and archaeological relics also under both State and Commonwealth legislation. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Archaeological and Aboriginal Relics Preservation Act 1972 provided for the preservation of archaeological and aboriginal relics. It enabled the Governor-in-Council to declare land to be an archaeological area for the preservation of relics therein, established an Archaeological Relics Advisory Committee to advise the Minister on all matters it thought necessary in relation to archaeological relics and the preservation of those relics.  The Act also made the buying and selling of relics and the possession or display of Aboriginal skeletal remains an offence in certain circumstances. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Historic Shipwrecks Act 1981 provided for the protection of historic shipwrecks and relics pertaining thereto and established an Historic Shipwrecks Advisory Committee to advise the Minister.  It enabled the Minister by notice published in the Government Gazette to declare shipwrecks and relics to be historic and to declare an area to be a protected zone and provided for a Register of Historic Shipwrecks.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Victorian Government has delegated authority under the Commonwealth Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976. This act is similar to the Victorian Act but relates to Commonwealth waters off Victoria.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Developments from 1993&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The administration of the closely related "aboriginal" and "maritime/historic" archaeological functions was split in 1993 when the aboriginal archaeology function remained with Aboriginal Affairs, Victoria (VA 3101) and the Victoria Archaeological Survey with responsibility for maritime and historic archaeology, was transferred back to the Planning portfolio.  By 1994, the Department of Planning and Development reported that the former Maritime and Historic Archaeology Unit had been integrated with the Heritage Branch of the Department to form Heritage Victoria within the Department of Planning and Development.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1995 the Heritage Act (No 93/1995) was passed with the goal of providing a consolidated legislative framework for the protection and conservation of places and objects of cultural heritage significance and the registration of such places and objects.  This Act was to replace both the Historic Buildings Act 1981 and the Historic Shipwrecks Act 1981.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The 16  member Heritage Council was to be appointed by the Governor in Council on the advice of the Minister.  These members were to be people with an interest and expertise in conservation rather than representatives of organisations.  The exception was to be the National Trust of Australia (Victoria) which might submit a panel of three names from which the Minister would choose one representative.  The Heritage Council and its Executive Director were to deal with the registration of all heritage sites, including historic shipwrecks and archaeological sites, on the Heritage Register and administer the provisions of the Heritage Act 1995 relating to maritime archaeology.  A new Historic Shipwrecks Advisory Committee of 12 members, one a member of the Heritage Council to act as Chair, one a nominee of the Minister administering the Commonwealth Navigation Act 1912 and the others being persons with expertise in specified areas, was to be appointed to advise the Council on all matters pertaining to historic shipwrecks and other maritime sites.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background

The Central Roads Board (VA 2803) included among its duties the distribution of grants to municipal bodies.  This responsibility was assumed by the Board of Land and Works upon its creation in 1857.  As local government authorities developed throughout Victoria so did the need to centrally co-ordinate them.  Apparently this was undertaken via the roads and bridges function in the first instance, as this provided an existing administrative framework through the construction of roads in municipal districts.  The emergence of a separate Local Government Branch in the Public Works Department (VA 669) appears to have occurred in about 1888 and the Branch continued to exist until 1958 when a separate department (VA 601) was established.

Minister of Local Government

The Minister for Local Government, first appointed in 1958, is responsible for local government authorities and the regulation and monitoring of their activities under the Local Government Act 1958 (No.6299  The Department of Local Government (VA 601) was established to assist the Minister in relation to:
   	approval of statutory procedures such as by-laws, submitted by municipalities
   	reviewing and amending legislation affecting local government 
   	examination and review of municipal boundaries.

The Department provided consultancy and advisory services to local government bodies in relation to administrative, financial, electoral and legislative matters as well as entrepreneurial activities and joint ventures.  It also had a monitoring role in relation to the operations of local government bodies and was empowered to conduct inquiries into complaints concerning local councils and officials.

Local government authorities are subject to the control of State Parliament through the Minister, and the Victorian State Government has the power to remove local councils and replace them with administrators.

In January 1991 the remaining core local government responsibilities were transferred to the newly appointed Minister for Ethnic, Municipal and Community Affairs, being exercised by the Office of Local Government.  With the establishment of the Ministry, the Local Government Department Act 1958, was repealed, and the Office became an Associated Administrative Unit.

Following significant machinery of government changes after the October 1992 election the Department of Planning and Development was established by Administrative Arrangements Order No.114. The Department inherited responsibility for local government from the short-lived Ministry of Ethnic, Municipal and Community Affairs.

Following significant machinery of government changes after the re-election of the Kennett Government in April 1996 the Department of Planning and Development was abolished. Under Administrative Arrangements Order No.150 all functions of the Department, except the Office of Housing, were transferred on 3 April 1996 to the Department of Infrastructure.</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;From 1922 to 1929 the Metropolitan Town Planning Commission (VA 3131), financed partly by Melbourne metropolitan municipalities and partly by contributions from the Railways, Tramways, Harbour Trust, and the Board of Works, operated in an advisory and honorary capacity. Its work included research and recommendations on urban development and town planning. Its 1929 report (concerning zoning, transport, recreation, harbours and rivers, building regulation, and conservation) provided a model for those urging government to enact a statutory planning regime and for those municipalities undertaking land use zoning up to 1944.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;As part of postwar reconstruction, the Commonwealth prompted the States to undertake both town and regional planning. In Victoria, town planning functions were set up on a statutory basis administered through the Town and Country Planning Board (T&amp;CPB) (VA 516). Regional planning (cf. regional development) was carried out through the State Regional Boundaries Committee and subsequently by the Central Planning Authority.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The work of the T&amp;CPB in the preparation, amendment, administration and enforcement of planning schemes and interim development orders included:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;	co-ordinating and advising planning authorities responsible for developing and administering statutory planning schemes, and&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;	advising the Minister whether or not schemes and scheme amendments prepared by municipalities and other planning authorities should be approved and gazetted. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Development of Strategic Planning 1968 to 1988 &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;After the overhaul of state planning legislation in 1968 the functions undertaken by the Town and Country Planning Board were broadened to include&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;	the co-ordinated development of statewide general land use planning policies to provide effective guidance for the preparation of statutory planning schemes and co-ordination of planning mechanisms available to various government agencies and statutory authorities &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;	preparation of Statements of Planning Policy with the assistance of the State Planning Council, later the State Co-ordination Council. These bodies consisted of representatives of various service, development and conservation authorities and were to develop broad scale, strategic land use policy and produce statements of planning policy for specific areas or types of land use which when approved by the Minister and gazetted, became government policy and legally binding on both councils and regional authorities. Statements of Planning Policy which came into operation were:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;	Statement of Planning Policy 1 (Westernport) 1970 (varied 1976)&lt;BR /&gt;	Statement of Planning Policy 2 (Mornington Peninsula) 1970 &lt;BR /&gt;	Statement of Planning Policy 3 (Upper Yarra Valley and Dandenongs)&lt;BR /&gt;	1971 (varied 1979)&lt;BR /&gt;	Statement of Planning Policy 4 (Yarra River) 1971 (varied 1979)&lt;BR /&gt;	Statement of Planning Policy 5 (Highway Areas) 1973 &lt;BR /&gt;	Statement of Planning Policy 6 (Land Use and Aerodromes) 1973 &lt;BR /&gt;	Statement of Planning Policy 7 (Geelong) 1973 &lt;BR /&gt;	Statement of Planning Policy 8 (Macedon Ranges and Surrounds) 1975 &lt;BR /&gt;	Statement of Planning Policy 9 (Central Gippsland) 1975 &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;It was envisaged that regional planning authorities established under the post-1968 legislation would operate in most, if not all, the regions of Victoria. It was also envisaged that the  Statements of Planning Policy would provide the guidelines for regional authorities to develop regional planning schemes (statutory) to be administered by local municipalities.  However most of those regional planning authorities which were established were given primarily a strategic planning role rather than a statutory planning role.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;From 1908, the Penal and Gaols Branch, Chief Secretary's Department was responsible for reformatory prisons and a system of probation established under the provisions of the Indeterminate Sentences Act 1907 (No.2106).  Administration of this Act was undertaken in conjunction with the Indeterminate Sentences Board from 1908 to 1957.  Under this scheme, offenders who had been convicted on indictment, could be given an indeterminate reformatory sentence either as an alternative to a fixed term sentence or on expiration of a fixed term sentence and prisoners were detained at the Governor's pleasure until they had demonstrated that they were eligible for release on probation.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1915, under the provisions of the Indeterminate Sentences Act (No.2758) the Board was given the power to grant temporary release to prisoners to test their reform.  This temporary release was known as parole and was usually granted for six months.  If the prisoner met the requirements of parole, a recommendation for release on probation was made and the period of probation was usually two years.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Reformatory prisons and the Indeterminate Sentences Board were abolished in 1957 under the provisions of the Penal Reform Act 1956 (No.5961). The Penal and Gaols Branch was responsible for the administration of the parole system established by the Act in conjunction with the Parole Board (VA 1087).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1960 under the provisions of the Social Welfare Act (No.6651) the Social Welfare Branch (VA 2784) was established within the Chief Secretary's Department assuming responsibility for functions previously administered by the Penal and Gaols Branch. Responsibility for functions relating to probation and parole was assumed by the Probation and Parole Division of the Social Welfare Branch and was administered in liaison with the Adult and Youth Parole Boards, Children's Court probation services having been transferred from the Attorney General (VRG 19) in 1960.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1971 following the appointment of a Minister for Social Welfare (VRG 60) responsibility for probation and parole was assumed by the newly established Social Welfare Department (VA 946). &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1979 a Minister for Community Services was appointed and a Department of Community Welfare Services was established under the provisions of the Community Welfare Services Act 1978 (No.9248). The Regional Services Division of the Department was responsible for the co-ordination of probation, parole and community service orders. By this time there was a clear separation of the administration of adult and juvenile correctional services. Juvenile correctional services became more closely linked to the provision of family and child welfare services. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1983 following a major review of Victoria's prison system, the Office of Corrections (VA 1063) was established under the provisions of the Community Welfare Services (Director General of Corrections) Act 1983 (No.9966).  The Office of Corrections was administratively separated from the Department of Community Welfare Services and the Director General exercises the power of a Chief Administrator. The Office of Corrections (VA 1063) assumed responsibility for adult correctional services only. Responsibility for juvenile correctional services remained with the Department of Community Welfare Services (VA 613).  &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1987 the Minister responsible for Corrections assumed responsibility for the Office of Corrections (VA 1063) which had been established under the provisions of the Community Welfare Services (Director General of Corrections) Act 1983 (No.9966).  The Office of Corrections was responsible for the administration of non-custodial services including attendance centre orders, probation orders and community service orders together with post-custodial, pre-release and parole programs. Administration of the parole program is undertaken in conjunction with the Adult Parole Board.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Following administrative changes in 1992, the Office of Corrections was absorbed into the newly formed Department of Justice.  Advice to the Adult Parole Board is provided by the Community Correctional Services Division of CORE  the Public Correctional Enterprise.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

In 1972 a Minister for Youth, Sport and Recreation was appointed and acquired responsibility from the Chief Secretary (VRG 26) for functions relating to these three areas as well as racing and gaming.  This appointment reflected increased central government interest in these matters, particularly sport and recreation, which had previously been largely the concern of municipalities and non-government agencies.  The Minister administered the Racing Act 1958 and the Youth, Sport and Recreation Act 1972.

The function from 1972 included promoting the fitness and general health of Victorians;  training programmes for recreational workers, sports officials and coaches;  providing advice and financial assistance to state wide recreation and sporting organisations;  assisting municipalities and community groups to provide facilities for sport and recreation;  regulation of professional boxing through the Professional Boxing Control Board;  and providing support for the Sport and Recreation Council and subsequently for the State Sports Council and the Community Recreation Council.</description>

       <description type="full">Background

Prior to 1970 the Government role with respect to young people was primarily divided between neglected children and juvenile offenders. Neglected children were often made wards of the State (see welfare services (neglected children)) while juvenile offenders were incarcerated (see youth training centres).

The Youth Welfare Division of the Social Welfare Department was established in 1970 under the Social Welfare Act 1970 (No.8089). This Division had responsibility for the social welfare of young persons and for the control of young persons in remand centres, youth training centres and youth hostels and the management of such State institutions. Welfare services for young persons other than wards or juvenile offenders were provided under this legislation (see welfare services (youth)).

The Social Welfare Act 1970 also provided for the constitution of a Youth Advisory Council to recommend to the Minister measures for the furtherance of the moral, intellectual and physical welfare and development of youth, to recommend the making of payments out of the Youth Organizations Assistance Fund and to promote and co-ordinate the activities of clubs and organizations with respect to the welfare of youth.

The Chief Secretary (VRG 26) exercised responsibility for functions relating to young people until the creation of the Youth, Sport and Recreation portfolio (VRG 66) in 1972. The youth affairs function initiated by the Social Welfare Act 1970 expanded considerably under the Youth, Sport and Recreation Act 1972.

The 1972 Act aimed at "acknowledging the positive potential of youth ... and providing opportunities for the development of that potential" rather than viewing youth work in terms of crime prevention. The Minister for Youth, Sport and Recreation (VRG 66) became responsible for: the development of a State Youth policy;  conduct of research into the needs of young people;  provision of leisure activities for young people in co-operation with community organisations and municipalities;  providing support to the State Youth Council;  and financial assistance to youth organisations. The correctional and remedial aspects of youth welfare continued to be administered within the Social Welfare Department (VA 946) within the Community Welfare Services portfolio (VRG 60).

The State Youth Council (VA 2200) was constituted under the 1972 Act, replacing the Youth Advisory Council. The State Youth Council was required to advise the Minister on all aspects of youth in society and to advise on the policy and principles which should govern the allocation of financial assistance for youth work from the State Youth Fund. The inaugral meeting was held in April 1973.

The development of youth affairs within the Youth, Sport and Recreation portfolio ensured that the initial focus was on providing financial assistance for recreational activities and services for young people. The groundwork for youth policy development began with the funding of the Youth 2000 series of consultative forums. By the late 1970's, early 1980's issues such as youth employment and unemployment, youth training, youth homelessness, special needs of young women and ethnic youth became a greater focus.

In 1982/83 the Department established pilot youth services development projects in municipalities identified as areas of high youth need and disadvantage as models for youth support services at the local government level.

The Youth Policy Development Council (VA 2666) was established in November 1984 under the Youth, Sport and Recreation (Advisory Councils) Act 1984 (No.10120) to advise the Minister: on the development and implementation of policies concerning young people;  setting priorities in relation to youth policies;  the participation and consultation of young people in the development of policies;  and the evaluation of services provided to young people. The Youth Policy Development Council superceeded the State Youth Council (VA 2200).

In March 1985 responsibility for sections of the Youth, Sport and Recreation Act 1972 relating to youth affairs were transferred from the Minister for Youth, Sport and Recreation (VRG 66) to the Minister for Employment and Industrial Affairs (VRG 81). The creation of the Department of Employment and Industrial Affairs (VA 2777) was to develop and manage labour market and youth policies and programs. The youth affairs function was viewed as the promotion of equitable access of all young people to the resources, opportunities and socio-economic structures of the State, through:
		development and co-ordination of youth policy
		development of opportunities for education, training and employment for youth
		support the development and provision of youth programs through the non-government sector.

In 1986 youth affairs passed to the Minister for Labour (VRG 86). The function under these Ministers encompassed: the operation of the Youth Guarantee Scheme;  the development of an integrated youth policy and the provision of assistance to young people.

The Youth Affairs Act 1986, proclaimed in May 1986, encompassed the principles underlying the activities of the Youth Affairs Bureau to provide a "legislative mechanism for greater responsiveness from Victoria's policy to the needs of the State's youth". 

The function by 1991 encompassed: the promotion of a social justice and equity framework for the development of youth services;  the promotion of effective cross-sectoral links with key government agencies in developing youth policies and services;  the provision of access to information;  the promotion of employment opportunities for young people and a role in the Government's response to youth homelessness.

From circa February 1991 until circa October 1992 the Minister responsible was the Minister for Ethnic, Municipal and Community Affairs. This portfolio was established as part of machinery of government changes and abolished during the subsequent machinery of government changes. For the first time it had brought together functions from quite separate portfolios which, after its abolition, once again became quite separate. For convenience it has been decided not to create a group based on the Ethnic, Municipal and Community Affairs portfolio and hence include the Minister for Ethnic, Municipal and Community Affairs within the portfolios which had undertaken the functions before and after this portfolio. This works neatly for all the functions except youth affairs.

A Minister for Youth Affairs was commissioned for the first time as part of the 1992 machinery of government changes. In order to account for the youth affairs function between its transfer from the Minister for Labour in 1991 until the commissioning of the Minister for Youth Affairs in 1992, it has been decided that the Youth Affairs group should be dated from 1991 and include the Minister for Ethnic, Municipal and Community Affairs as the first Minister in the group.

The Office of Youth Affairs promoted a social justice and equity framework for the development of youth services as well as effective cross-sectoral links with key Government agencies in developing youth policies and youth services. The Office also provided young people with access to information and promoted employment opportunities for young people aged between 15 and 19.  The Office also had a lead role in the Government's response to youth homelessness.

The Office of Youth Affairs within the Department of Business and Employment was involved in policy development and analysis of youth issues;  youth service development through the provision of subsidies and grants;  implementation of youth homelessness policy and other special projects.

The Youth Affairs Act was repealed by the Children and Young Persons (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act 1996.  The Office of Youth Affairs was not retained after the 1996 election.</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;No research has yet been undertaken into the role of the Public Works Department in the construction and supervision of public buildings and the way in which the Department exercised its responsibility for public works.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;It is clear that the civil establishment of the Department always included a very significant number of architects, engineers, draftsmen and inspectors who were responsible for the preparation of plans and specifications and the preparation of estimates for furniture and fittings.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;It is also apparent that most of this work was undertaken by  contractors but the role and responsibility of the Department in the letting and supervision of contracts is yet to be researched.  Until 1964, statutory responsibility for the design, construction and maintenance of public buildings, the approval of plans and specifications, the consideration of tenders, the supervision of contracts and the approval of requisitions for buildings, furniture and repairs was vested in the Board of Land and Works (VA 744).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1987 a Minister for Housing and Construction was appointed and assumed responsibility for the fitout of Government accommodation and the maintenance of air-conditioning in Government buildings. The Department of Property and Services was formally created by Order-in-Council on 16 May 1978.  It was originally principally concerned with coordinating the provision of centralised services to other government agencies.  In 1988 the Department assumed responsibility for the supply of furniture, stores and equipment, fitting out government accommodation, maintenance of air-conditioning, and related survey and drafting functions for government constructions from the Ministry of Housing and Construction.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;This function was transferred in 1991 to the Department of Finance and from 1996 the Department of Treasury and Finance.  Presently, in 2001, it is exercised by the Victorian Government Property group within that Department.&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background

State regulation of relations between employers and employees has been subject to various legislative provisions, the nature of which has changed over time. State legislation has included provisions for the imposition of penalties for breach of employment contracts, for minimum wages and conditions of employment, for registration of unions of employers and employees, for processes of conciliation and arbitration to settle industrial disputes and for the registration of Determinations and Awards having the force of law. 

State regulation of labour has had two principal strands: the regulation of physical conditions (see workplace health and safety) and the regulation of non-physical conditions such as wages, hours, leave etc. It would appear that industrial relations has mostly been concerned with wages and hours and other non-physical conditions. Since 1904 responsibility for working conditions has been shared with the Commonwealth which has responsibility for industries operating nationally.

To 1896

Relations between employers and employees were originally conducted by means of contracts of service which were subject to the provisions of Masters and Servants Acts, principally concerned with the imposition of penalties for breach of contract. Early attempts by workers to form unions ("combinations") for mutual benefit and protection as well as unified action to improve wages, hours and conditions were subject to legal obstacles. 

The first State intervention to protect the health and welfare of certain industrial workers was provided for in the Supervision of Workrooms and Factories Act 1873 (37 Vic., No.466) which forbad the employment of any female in a factory employing not less than ten persons for more than eight hours in any day. The Act sought to "mitigate the worst evils of the factory system" but its inadequacies, including a lack of enforcement, led to public agitation and strikes which resulted in the appointment of a Royal Commission in 1882. The result of the Commissioner's Report of March 1884 was the Factories and Shops Act 1885 (49 Vic., No.862), which became operative in March 1886. That Act regulated the hours of work of women and children. It also provided for the registration of factories and the appointment of inspectors to ensure greater compliance with the Act's provisions.

The Trade Unions Act 1884 provided  for the registration of unions. Registration under the Act gave a trade union a corporate identity and legal status for the purpose of engaging in strikes. Registration was not compulsory and few unions  registered under this Act.

1896 to 1981

The Royal Commission of 1882 considered the introduction of Courts of Conciliation and Arbitration for the negotiation and settlement of industrial disputes. It was not until the Factories and Shops Act 1896 (60 Vic., No.1445) was passed, however, that a Government system for negotiating industrial disputes (other than a Court of Law) was introduced. The Act provided for special Boards, comprising representatives of employers and employees, to be elected by their peers (with the exception of a Board for the furniture trade which was to be appointed by the Governor in Council) with power to determine the lowest price or rate of payment for preparing or manufacturing clothing, footwear and furniture and for bread making and baking. 

The Wages Board system which developed for the settlement of industrial disputes, including the determination of wages, hours and conditions of employment, had its origins in Victoria and was based on the jury principle of trial by peers. The special Boards originally consisted of equal numbers of representatives of employers and employees, with the qualification that each should be actively engaged in the trade concerned. The Factories and Shops Act 1934 modified this to permit a paid officer of any corporation, public body, or association of employers to be elected to represent employers. If such an officer was appointed then one of the employees' representatives was to be an officer of the trade union concerned.

Originally four Boards were established and subsequently there were over two hundred in operation. The work of each Board related to the wages and conditions of work of a particular group or category of workers working in a specific trade, a branch of a trade, or a related group of trades. Until the early 1900's the wages of the majority of the wage earners were not determined by the Wages Boards. In most cases wage rates were simply determined by collective bargaining or, where unions did not exist, by individual work contracts.

It is evident that initially the Wages Boards were primarily forums for negotiation between employers and employees, agreement being reached by a majority of votes. The independent Chairman (appointed by the Governor in Council) appears to have been given a casting vote. Gradually the Chairman was vested with power to determine a matter where the representatives of each side could not agree. The employment conditions set by the Boards were known as Determinations and had the force of law.

The matters which could be determined by the Wages Boards were extended by amendments to the original legislation. The Factories and Shops Act 1897 (61 Vic., No.1518) provided that the minimum wage could be varied according to the age and sex of the workers. The Factories and Shops Act 1898 (62 Vic., No.1597) amended the 1896 Act with respect to the Special Boards including the provision of a right of appeal against decisions of the Special Boards before the Supreme Court (see employment conditions appeals below) and a provision that the Special Boards could also fix the maximum number of hours per week to which the rate of payment applied. The Factories and Shops Act 1903 (3 Edw.VII, No.1857) provided for special wages to be fixed for "aged, infirm or slow" workers. The Factories and Shops Act 1907 (7 Edw.VII, No.2137), which came into force 1 March 1908, provided for the Special Board system to be extended to certain trades and businesses not connected with factories. The Factories and Shops Act 1909 (9 Edw.VII, No.2184) provided for Special Boards to be appointed with respect to shops to fix wages, prices or rates. The Factories and Shops Act 1909 (No.2) (9 Edw.VII, No.2241) increased the powers of the Special Boards, including the prescription of the form of apprenticeship indentures. The Factories and Shops Act 1910 (1 Geo.V, No.2291) provided for Special Boards to fix the number or proportionate number of apprentices and improvers employed in any trade, business or occupation. The Factories and Shops Act 1910 (No.2) (1 Geo.V, No.2305) provided for Special Boards to be appointed for any trade, business or occupation in the whole or any part of Victoria and extended their powers to fix the times of beginning and ending work upon each day, and to fix special rates for Sundays and public holidays. The Factories and Shops Act 1927 extended the powers of the Wages Boards to determine any matter with respect to conditions of employment.

The Labour and Industry Act 1953 provided that Wages Boards could make a Determination in respect of any one or more employers or establishments, could hear the representations of any interested organisation or person and could appoint a Board of Reference to determine disputes of fact concerning any provision of a Determination. The Act also required organisations of employers or employees to inform the Chairman of the appropriate Wages Board of any impending or actual industrial dispute.

Certain minimum conditions, such as a minimum weekly wage, were provided for in the legislation. The enforcement of both the legislative requirements and the requirements of Determinations set by the Boards was undertaken by Inspectors of the Department of State of the Minister administering the relevant legislation - see the Industrial Compliance function.

1981 to 1992

Following recommendations of a Committee for Review of the Labour and Industry Act 1958 the Industrial Relations Act 1979 (No.9365) was introduced, coming into operation on 1 November 1981. The Act provided for the establishment of the Industrial Relations Commission. The role of the Commission was to expeditiously resolve industrial disputes, to determine industrial matters and, through a system of Conciliation and Arbitration Boards, promote the resolution of industrial difficulties without recourse to industrial action.

The powers and duties of the Industrial Relations Commission were able to be exercised by either the President sitting alone (referred to as the Commission in Court session), the President and both Commissioners sitting together (referred to as the Commission in full session) or one Commissioner sitting alone. The powers vested in the President sitting alone were exercised as a result of his/her qualification to be appointed a Judge of the Supreme Court.

The Commission in full session could hear and determine:
applications for the constitution or abolition of a Board
applications for the jurisdiction of a Board to be increased or reduced
applications for the interpretation of an award or registered agreement
any industrial matter referred by the Minister, a Board or the Chairman of a Board
appeals against awards made by the Conciliation and Arbitration Boards
appeals against the decision of the registrar to recognise or refuse to recognise an industrial association
matters relating to the recognition of industrial associations
applications to revoke the registration of an industrial agreement.

The Commission in Court session could hear and determine:
appeals against convictions by a Magistrates Court for an offence against the Industrial Relations Act, the Labour and Industry Act or the Industrial Training Act
applications by industrial associations to convene a meeting of a Board
appeals against decisions of the secretary to refuse to register or to cancel the registration of any factory or shop or market site.

A Commissioner sitting alone could hear and determine any industrial dispute or matter referred to the Commission as directed by the President of the Commission.

Under the 1979 Act, Conciliation and Arbitration Boards (VA 1010) were able to be established by the Commission for any trade, branch of a trade, or group of trades.  These Boards replaced the Wages Boards and had power to make an Award relating to any industrial matter concerning the trade for which they were appointed. The matters most often dealt with were:
days and hours of work
pay and wages
privileges and rights of employers/employees
industrial disputes
terms and conditions of employment
demarcation disputes.
The Industrial Relations Commission oversaw these Boards and had the power to create or abolish Boards and to define, vary or extend the area of jurisdiction of any Board.

Under the Industrial Relations Act 1979 any association of employers or employees could apply to be recognised as an association with respect to any trade or trades for which a Conciliation and Arbitration Board had been constituted. Applications for recognition as an association were required to be lodged with the Registrar of the Industrial Relations Commission. Recognition gave the association the right to nominate members for appointment to Boards, to appear before the Commission or a Board and to enter into industrial agreements. Recognition under this Act did not confer corporate status on an association. 

Industrial agreements between recognised associations of employers and/or employees were required to be filed with the Registrar and, if approved by the Commission, were to be registered.

The Industrial Relations (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act 1987 (No.94/1987) was passed on 30 April 1987 and incorporat... truncated</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1975 a Community Services Centre was opened by the Premier with an aim to create greater understanding between all members of society and to create equal opportunities for all. In particular, it was intended to provide information on the activities of government departments and instrumentalities, and also to provide a place for the public to put their problems to trained officers. Located within the Premier's Department (VA 2717), the Centre included several bureaux which carried out functions which later developed within the Premier's portfolio. The Migrant Advisory Bureau provided information to migrants about the activities of Government and heard problems facing migrants and the Interpreting Services Bureau provided free interpreting services to migrants. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The ethnic affairs function arose from a concern for the post-migration after care and well-being of migrants. As part of its function the Migrant Advisory Bureau published 'Migrants Melbourne', a directory of community resources and information, in several different languages. The Interpreting Services Bureau provided services for migrants re legal, medical, employment, accommodation and general business. Prior to this only gratuities were paid for interpreting services in a number of departments, including: Chief Secretary;  Health;  Lands;  Labour and Industry and Housing. Interpreter-translators were also employed in the Education Department although the history of these services requires further research. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Ethnic affairs became a more established function of Government when it was transferred to the newly-appointed Minister of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (VRG 68) in 1976. The agency responsible was the Ministry of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (VA 1042) established in 1977. Although the new Ministry assumed responsibility for the substantive ethnic affairs function, the Community Services Centre continued to provide interpreting services until circa 1982 (when the Interpreting Services Bureau became part of the Ministry) as well as an advisory service for migrants as part of its role in the provision of government information.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Ministry of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs Act 1976 (No.8963) was the first legislation in an Australian State to give statutory recognition to a Ministry concerned with migrants and ethnic groups. The State had undertaken an immigration function while the Commonwealth Government had accepted prime responsibility for post-settlement services to migrants, particularly migrants of non-British background. At this time the Commonwealth Government was looking to the States to take new initiatives and responsibilities.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The function of ethnic affairs, as expressed in the 1976 Act, was:&lt;BR /&gt;	 to promote settlement of migrants in the community&lt;BR /&gt;	 to encourage ethnic groups to fully express their identity&lt;BR /&gt;	 to develop community awareness of ethnic cultures&lt;BR /&gt;	 to facilitate the building of a socially cohesive society&lt;BR /&gt;	 to encourage migrants to fully participate in the community&lt;BR /&gt;	 to prevent or remove racial discrimination&lt;BR /&gt;	 to promote the welfare of migrants.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Activities undertaken as part of this function included:&lt;BR /&gt;	 responsibility for the Victoria Welcome Group&lt;BR /&gt;	 provision of financial assistance for projects which furthered the concept of a cohesive but culturally diverse community (included funding of festivals, furnishing community centres, establishment of resource centres) &lt;BR /&gt;	 Cross Cultural Awareness Programs for persons working with migrant&lt;BR /&gt;	clients&lt;BR /&gt;	 community liaison between ethnic groups and government agencies&lt;BR /&gt;	 publication of the resource directory 'Migrants' Melbourne' in several languages&lt;BR /&gt;	 student exchange schemes&lt;BR /&gt;	 investigation of the needs of ethnic communities and research into ways to meet these needs&lt;BR /&gt;	 translation services to government departments and instrumentalities (from 1979)&lt;BR /&gt;	 seminars and talks relevant to ethnic communities&lt;BR /&gt;	 community education programs to improve understanding and interaction among ethnic groups&lt;BR /&gt;	 investigation, conciliation and arbitration of migrant cases (such as legal problems, workers compensation, neighbourhood problems, housing, recognition of overseas qualifications etc.)&lt;BR /&gt;	 monitoring government policies/reviews to identify discrimination against migrants&lt;BR /&gt;	 relevant statistical research.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Ethnic Affairs Commission (VA 1029) was established on 9 November 1982 by the Ethnic Affairs Commission Act 1982 (No.9789). This Act repealed the Ministry of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs Act 1976 (No.8963) although a Ministry of Ethnic Affairs (VA 1042) continued to exist with the Chairman of the Ethnic Affairs Commission as the Permanent Head of the Ministry from 15 March 1983.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The exact nature of the relationship between the Commission and the Ministry of Ethnic affairs is subject to further research. The Commission comprised three full-time members (the Chairman and two deputies) and ten part-time members, none of whom could be subject to the Public Service Act 1974 (No.8656) in their capacity as Commission members. The Act, however, made provision for public servants to be appointed for "the proper functioning of the Commission". It is therefore evident that between 1983 and 1991 the Ministry of Ethnic Affairs (VA 1042) carried out many of the functions of the Commission as determined by the 1982 Act. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;As part of the machinery of government changes in 1991 the "policy development and administrative responsibilities" of the Ethnic Affairs Commission were placed with the Office of Ethnic Affairs, established as an associated administrative unit of the Ministry of Ethnic, Municipal and Community Affairs (MEMCA). As it is assumed that the Ministry of Ethnic Affairs previously undertook the "policy development and administrative responsibilities" of the Commission, the transfer of the substantive ethnic affairs function effectively occurred from the Ministry of Ethnic Affairs to the Office of Ethnic Affairs within MEMCA.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;At this time the function encompassed the following activities:&lt;BR /&gt;	analysis of policies and programs which impacted on people of non-English speaking background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;	project development, often in conjunction with other Government departments (examples included: Spanish-speaking Women's Radio Project;  Multicultural Nursing Workforce Project;  Child Protection Issues Project;  Telecom Multilingual Project)&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;	community relations, such as&lt;BR /&gt;	( provision of information and advice to the Attorney-General on racial          vilification&lt;BR /&gt;	( publicity of racism issues&lt;BR /&gt;	( participation in the Ethnic Affairs/Police Liaison Committee to improve        communication and understanding between ethnic groups and the police&lt;BR /&gt;	( administrative and financial support to World Conference on Religion and    Peace, and National Refugee Week&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;	 involvement in migrant worker issues, such as&lt;BR /&gt;	( English on the Job initiatives&lt;BR /&gt;	( occupational health and safety&lt;BR /&gt;	( recognition of overseas qualifications&lt;BR /&gt;	( liaison with trade unions&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;	 promoting the value of ethnic diversity, including&lt;BR /&gt;	( provision of funds to community based organisations, particularly for         projects targeting community relations&lt;BR /&gt;	( involvement in specific events such as Children's Week, National               Association for Visual Arts Survey&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Ethnic Affairs Unit was established within the Department of Premier and Cabinet (VA 1039) as part of machinery of government changes introduced in October 1992. The substantive ethnic affairs function, including language services, was transferred to the Unit from the Office of Ethnic Affairs. The Premier once again became responsible for ethnic affairs in conjunction with the Minister for Ethnic Affairs (VRG 76).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The function currently encompasses:&lt;BR /&gt;	 provision of policy advice to the Government in the areas of immigration, settlement, community relations, ethnic and multicultural affairs&lt;BR /&gt;	 input into national and local policies relating to the above areas&lt;BR /&gt;	 assisting government and non-government agencies to develop programs and services appropriate to a culturally diverse community&lt;BR /&gt;	 representing the Government at interstate and national forums&lt;BR /&gt;	 monitoring policies, strategies and planning processes&lt;BR /&gt;	 liaison between the Ethnic Affairs Commission (VA 1029), the community and other departments.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Commission's role appears to focus on the provision of advice to the Minister, advocacy and community relations, while the Unit undertakes the substantive ethnic affairs function and provides administrative support to the Commission, including maintaining records created by the Commission.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Interpreting and Translating Services&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The ethnic affairs function has encompassed:&lt;BR /&gt;	 translation services to Government departments and instrumentalities &lt;BR /&gt;	 interpreting services for organisations and individuals &lt;BR /&gt;	 specialist interpreting and translating services in the legal,health, mental health and education areas (the previous history of these services has been quite fragmented and is subject to further research)&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1991 the importance of the provision of interpreting and translating services was reflected in the machinery of government changes whereby speciality language services in the areas of health and education, and legal and general language services provided by the Ministry of Ethnic Affairs, were consolidated within the Office of Ethnic Affairs.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The language services, thereafter administered under the name of the Victorian Interpreting and Translating Service (VITS), included the following specialist services:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;	Legal Interpreting Service&lt;BR /&gt;	General Interpreting Service&lt;BR /&gt;	Mental Health Interpreting Service&lt;BR /&gt;	Central Health Interpreting Service&lt;BR /&gt;	Education Interpreting Service&lt;BR /&gt;	Translation Service.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Since 1999, the Victorian Interpreting and Translating Service has operated as a State Business Corporation under the State Owned Enterprises Act 1992&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Relationship to Equal Opportunity Function&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Ministry of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs Act 1976 (No.8963) included provision for steps to be taken "to prevent or remove discrimination against persons because of their ethnic background or characteristics", although the legislation included no sanctions attached to this objective. The ethnic affairs function included the receipt and conciliation of complaints of racial discrimination under these provisions until 1983.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Equal Opportunity Act 1977 (No.9025) made it unlawful to discriminate on the grounds of sex (including sexual harassment) or marital status in the areas of employment, education, accommodation, and the provision of goods and services. The equal opportunity function encompassed the investigation, conciliation and adjudication of complaints of discrimination on these grounds until July 1983 when, by agreement with the Commonwealth, the grounds of complaint could include unlawful racial discrimination under the federal Racial Discrimination Act 1975. The Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (No.10095) subsequently extended the grounds of unlawful discrimination within Victoria to include race, colour, nationality, and ethnic or national origin, and extended the areas to which the Act applies to clubs which receive Government funding or which use Crown land.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The equal opportunity function was the responsibility of the Premier (VRG 50) from 1977 until 1985 and from 1985 it became the responsibility of the Attorney-General (VRG 19). &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Reservation of coastal public land prior to 1978&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Most coastal land was originally reserved for public use according to a set of orders made in the 1870s and 1880s. Reservation was intended to guarantee public access to water by preventing the sale of any further Crown lands adjoining bodies of water.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Coastal margins were originally retained to facilitate water transport and associated land access. In non-port areas they were usually regarded as easements, rights of way or land banks for possible future developments. Crown frontages to Port Phillip Bay were created as early as the late 1830s and from the early 1850s they were identified by surveyors as a matter of course right around the bay. Some of the beaches close to Melbourne were specially reserved as parks, gardens or for recreation in the mid and late 1860s but most were not given firm protection until 1873 when legislative steps were taken to remove a loophole which had allowed coastal land to be converted to freehold under section 42 of the Land Act 1865. In June 1873 all "unappropriated" Crown lands along the shores of Port Phillip Bay were permanently reserved. The remainder of the coastline was reserved over the next decade and on the 23 May 1881 a blanket reservation was made of all unalienated land within one and a half chains of the colony's " Rivers, Rivulets, Creeks, Channels, Aqueducts, Lakes, Reservoirs, Swamps, Inlets, Loughs and Straits".&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Coastal public land so reserved has traditionally been occupied on an annual permit or licence basis. These occupations generally fall into one of two categories of permit. Permits for activities associated with recreational use of the frontage and adjoining waters, such as jetties, boatsheds, bathing boxes, boat and swimming club-houses, refreshment booths etc. are issued by the local controlling body, usually the municipal council. The second form of occupation is grazing where there is little or no public usage and no local controlling body. Grazing licences are issued by the central government department responsible for the public lands function.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In addition special legislation has on occasions allowed proprietary rights to coastal lands for certain purposes. For instance, in St. Kilda, an Act in 1965 allowed the municipal council to enter into leases for a specified portion of the shore reserve for a maximum term of 50 years for the provision of a marina and restaurant. In 1967 statutory provision was made for leases for a maximum term of 21 years for surf life-saving associations.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Committees of Management&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Coastal public lands, in the same way as many other public lands reserved for public purposes, are directly controlled by Committees of Management which are appointed by the Minister responsible for public lands. In most cases the local municipal council is appointed, in others, local individuals are elected to the committees. These Committees of Management may obtain advice from, and in some matters are subject to statutory control by, the government agencies which deal with fire protection, land conservation, planning etc. Some coastal public lands are controlled directly by port authorities and other statutory bodies.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Co-ordination of coastal land management from 1978&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1978, under the provisions of the Crown Land (Reserves) Act 1978, (No.9212) the Coastal Management and Co-ordination Committee (CMCC) was established with responsibility for the oversight of management and protection of the coastline of Victoria, except that around Port Phillip Bay and excluding land vested in port authorities or managed under the National Parks Act or Wildlife Act. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1983 responsibility for the CMCC was transferred to the Minister for Planning and Environment placing responsibility for planning and co-ordination of management of all coastal lands (except major ports and national parks) within the ambit of one department. Thus all planning, management, works, funding and protection of coastal resources, as well as assistance with the preparation of management plans, in conjunction with other government agencies, committees of management and coastal municipalities, were administered by the newly established Coastal Unit within the Ministry of Planning and Environment (VA 1024). The Minister was responsible for approval of management plans, changes to plans and changes in use and development, and approval of leases, licences and permits.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;From 1983 until October 1985, while responsibility for the CMCC lay with the Minister for Planning and Environment, the Department of Conservation, Forests and Lands (VA 1034) continued to undertake some coastal management functions such as central policy and planning co-ordination as well as technical support to the Department's nine coastal regions and works programming for coastal areas. It also undertook the purchase of freehold land for addition to existing coastal reserves;  reviews of existing management systems and charges for  occupation of coastal Crown land;  erosion control works funded by Land Protection Service grants;  major stabilisation projects in coastal parks and coastal reserves and representation on the Optional Dress Bathing Committee convened by the Local Government Department.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In October 1985 revised coastal management arrangements were introduced.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Department of Conservation, Forests and Lands assumed responsibility for managing the coast outside Port Phillip Bay. Although responsibility for the legislation under which the CMCC exercised its powers passed to the Minister for Conservation, Forests and Lands in 1985, staff engaged in coastal management were employed in two agencies. The staff who provided the administrative support for the CMCC were based in the Department of Conservation, Forests and Lands while the Chair of the CMCC came from within the Ministry of Planning and Environment.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Ministry for Planning and Environment meanwhile retained responsibility for strategic planning for coastal areas. The Coasts, Open Space and Waterways Branch within the Heritage and Environment Division of the Ministry undertook coastal management activities such as: the development of the State Coastal Strategy, the Gippsland Lakes Strategy and the Mordialloc Foreshore Strategy to deal with issues such as the protection of resources, water quality, and development potential (in order to provide guidelines within which management plans were to be prepared for the nine coastal planning districts and to provide a framework for co-ordinating the activities of the various responsible authorities);  the development of Building Height Controls along Port Phillip Bay;  the development of several coastal management plans intended to ensure a balance between coastal use and conservation and to ensure that conflict between the various activities within coastal areas was minimised. Through representation on the CMCC and its five Regional Coastal Committees, the Ministry implemented its strategies within the coastal land management process and co-ordinated its work with those agencies with direct responsibility for coastal land management such as the Department of Conservation, Forests and Lands and the port authorities - see planning (to 1988).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;From 1985 the agencies responsible for public land management had prime responsibility for co-ordinating the management of public coastal zones. The CMCC, which reported to the Minister responsible for public land functions, directly controlled and co-ordinated all works and developments in coastal areas within its jurisdiction through the statutory planning process described above.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The functions of the CMCC included:&lt;BR /&gt;carrying out investigations and preparing reports on coastal reserves&lt;BR /&gt;preparing management plans in consultation with committees of management or municipalities&lt;BR /&gt;exhibiting management plans for public scrutiny after the consent of the Minister in consultation with the Minister for Planning&lt;BR /&gt;considering submissions in respect of the exhibited management plans and submitting final management plans to the Minister (for final approval after consultation with the Minister for Planning,)&lt;BR /&gt;co-ordinating works to be carried out by public authorities and committees of management on coastal reserves&lt;BR /&gt;approving proposed works and improvements to coastal reserves&lt;BR /&gt;Coastal Management since 1990&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Since 1990, coastal management has remained under the control of government departments concerned with conservation, natural resources and the environment.  From 1996, the responsibility for statewide policy advice and the administration of special projects relating to coasts have been situated in the Department of Natural Resources and Environment.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Coastal Management Act 1995 legislated to provide an effective long-term statutory and institutional framework for the coast to be managed in a sustainable fashion with decisions regarding competing uses being able to be balanced in the interests of all.  The whole of the Victorian coast, including Port Phillip Bay was to be included under this legislation.  The Coastal Management and Co-ordination Committee was to be replaced with the Victorian Coastal Council comprising up to eleven members.  The Council was responsible for:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;-   undertaking statewide strategic coastal planning&lt;BR /&gt;providing advice to the Minister of Environment and Conservation&lt;BR /&gt;monitoring the development of coastal action plans&lt;BR /&gt;encouraging the cooperation of agencies, local government, the community and others in the planning and management of the coast.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Three coastal regions were defined  - Western, Central and Gippsland.  Twelve member regional coastal boards were also provided for in the Act with these regional boards to be responsible for:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;developing Coastal Action Plans for the region&lt;BR /&gt;undertaking and facilitating regional strategic planning for coastal issues&lt;BR /&gt;encouraging a cooperative approach amongst regional interest groups in developing and implementing strategic solutions to matters affecting the conservation and use of the regions coast.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Membership of the Coastal Council and the Regional Boards was to be selected on the basis of the skills and experience of members in areas related to conservation, tourism, business, recreation, commerce, issues relating to indigenous peoples, community affairs, town planning, local government and coastal engineering.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Local committees of management were to remain, although the number of bodies responsible was to be rationalised.  These local committees were to operate in accordance with the strategic directions of the Council and Boards.  Use and development control was to be implemented through the planning permit process managed by local government.&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Land Conservation Council was established in 1971 to replace the Land Utilisation Advisory Council, formed in 1950 at the same time as the Soil Conservation Authority. The Advisory Council's functions were to define catchment areas and advise the Minister and the Soil Conservation Authority on land use in any catchment area. In 1966 the Land Utilisation Advisory Council was charged with recommending the best uses of Crown lands in Victoria. There was no provision for public participation on the Council, however, and as a result of public interest in land-use management and the controversy over the future of the Little Desert, the Land Conservation Act 1970 was passed and the Land Conservation Council established to carry out investigations and make recommendations to the Minister on the balanced use of public land throughout Victoria.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Land Conservation Act 1970 required that the recommendations made must take into account the present and future needs of the people of Victoria in relation to :&lt;BR /&gt;		preservation of ecologically significant areas&lt;BR /&gt;		conservation of areas of natural interest, beauty, or historical interest&lt;BR /&gt;		creation and preservation of areas of reserved forests, areas for leisure and recreation and reserves for fish and wildlife &lt;BR /&gt;		preservation of species of native plants &lt;BR /&gt;		land required by government departments and public authorities in order to carry out their functions&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In conducting investigations and making recommendations to the Minister on the use of public land, the Council undertook the following steps:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;	Publication of notice of the Council's intention to commence an investigation in an area in the Government Gazette and local and state newspapers. &lt;BR /&gt;	Preparation of a factual descriptive report by officers of the Council providing a basis for public submissions. &lt;BR /&gt;	Invitation to individuals and interested bodies to make written submissions on the balanced use of the public land in question within 60 or 90 days after publication of the report.&lt;BR /&gt;	Consideration by Council of the report and all submissions.&lt;BR /&gt;	Drafting of set of proposed recommendations.&lt;BR /&gt;	Publication of proposed recommendations.&lt;BR /&gt;	Consideration of submissions sent in response to publication of draft recommendations followed by final recommendations to the Minister.&lt;BR /&gt;	Tabling of final recommendation in both houses of Parliament. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Minister might then notify government agencies affected by the recommendations of her/his intention to accept the recommendations. At least 14 days after this notification the Governor-in-Council might direct government bodies to implement those recommendations that affect land for which they had management responsibility.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Environment Conservation Council&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1997 the Land Conservation Act 1970 was repealed by the Environment Conservation Council Act with the Land Conservation Council being replaced by the Environment Conservation Council.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;This new Council was to conduct investigations into the balanced use or development of public land or any flora, fauna or minerals on or under the land.  Investigations were to be at the request of the Minister.  Copies of Ministerial requests were to be tabled in Parliament and published in the Government Gazette.  Notices of investigations were to be published by the Council with any persons able to make submissions to the Council.  The Council was to report to the Minister with a copy of the report to be tabled in Parliament.  In conducting investigations the Council was to take into account:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;the ability of any existing or proposed development to be ecologically sustainable and economically viable; &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;the social and economic value of any development; &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;the needs of conservation and protection&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;the need for the creation and preservation of parks and reserves&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;any international obligations entered into by the Commonwealth or other States and Territories and&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;the need to protect and conserve biodiversity.&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;1948 to 1969&lt;BR /&gt;In 1948 the Town and Country Planning Act 1944 was amended to include provision for a right of appeal against the refusal of a responsible authority to grant a planning permit, or by conditions attached to any planning permit. All determinations were made by the appropriate Minister (Public Works to 1958;  Local Government 1958 to 1969). &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;1969 to&lt;BR /&gt;The Town Planning Appeals Tribunal was constituted under the Town and Country Planning Act 1961 by the Town and Country Planning (Amendment) Act 1968 (No. 7676). The Tribunal came into being in 1969 and held its first sitting on 28April of that year. It was empowered by Act 7676 to "hear and determine all appeals against decisions of responsible authorities with respect to applications for permits under interim development orders and planning schemes."&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Tribunal initially consisted of six persons and sat in divisions. Each division was composed of a chairman, who was required to be a barrister and solicitor, and two members. The members were to have knowledge that included town planning and public administration, commerce or industry. Changes to the legislation in 1970 allowed the number of members to be increased and additional divisions to sit. The Tribunal generally sat at its city premises but was empowered, where necessary, to conduct hearings throughout the State.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Hearings were intended to be conducted informally and it was provided that the Tribunal would act without regard to technicalities or legal forms and was not bound by the rules of evidence. It could, subject to the requirements of justice, inform itself on any matter in such manner as was appropriate. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Appeals could be made to the Tribunal by persons aggrieved by the:&lt;BR /&gt;	failure of a responsible authority to grant a permit; &lt;BR /&gt;	refusal of a responsible authority to grant a permit; &lt;BR /&gt;	refusal of a responsible authority to consider an application; &lt;BR /&gt;	conditions in a permit granted by a responsible authority; &lt;BR /&gt;	failure or refusal of a responsible authority to extend the time of commencement or completion of any development; &lt;BR /&gt;	certain restrictions on land use and construction as set out in section 19(c) of the Act;  or&lt;BR /&gt;	determination, as an objector, of a responsible authority to grant a permit.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;A responsible authority was the body which prepared and submitted a planning scheme for approval or enforced and carried out a planning scheme. It could be the council of a municipality, the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works(VA 1107), the Town and Country Planning Board (VA 516) or, in the case of joint scheme involving more than one body, the committee which prepared the scheme. Responsible authorities could also, with the approval of the Governor in Council, make interim development orders prior to the final approval for planning schemes being granted. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Decisions of the Tribunal were provided to all parties to an appeal in writing. Statement of reasons, if not included in the written decision, were provided on request within 14 days of the decision. Decisions of the Tribunal were final and binding on responsible authorities and persons affected by the decision. The only appeal against a decision was to the Supreme Court on questions of law.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Administrative support was provided to the Tribunal by the Local Government Department until 1974. In 1974 the Ministry for Planning Act1973 placed the Tribunal within the Ministry for Planning (VA 600). The Town and Country Planning (Amalgamation) Act1980 made provision for the amalgamation of the Ministry for Planning and the Town and Country Planning Board (VA 516). This amalgamation resulted in the formation of a new department, the Department of Planning (VA 599), effective from February 1981, and the Tribunal was provided with administrative support by that Department until December 1981 when the Tribunal ceased to exist. At that date the Planning Appeals Board (VA 1408) commenced operation and assumed the responsibilities previously undertaken by a number of bodies including the Town Planning Appeals Tribunal.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;1981 to 1987&lt;BR /&gt;The Planning Appeals Board was established by the Planning Appeals Board Act 1980 (No.9512) which was assented to on 23 December 1980 and which came into operation on 1 December 1981. The Board heard appeals against decisions made by various bodies in planning and land use matters until 1987. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Board consisted of a chief chairman and a deputy chief chairman, (each of whom was to be a barrister and solicitor of the Supreme Court of not less than eight years standing) up to six senior members and any number of full time and part time members as were necessary from time to time. All members were to be appointed by the Governor in Council and were not subject to the Public Service Act. A registrar was appointed subject to the Public Service Act.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Board assumed the jurisdiction of several former authorities that heard appeals, which Act 9512 specified as:&lt;BR /&gt;	Town Planning Appeals Tribunal (VA 598); &lt;BR /&gt;	 Environment Protection Appeal Board; &lt;BR /&gt;	any arbiter appointed under section 569AA(1A) of the Local Government Act 1958; &lt;BR /&gt;   Drainage Tribunal; &lt;BR /&gt;	Health Commission of Victoria established under the Health Commission Act 1977 in exercising its jurisdiction under section 95 of the Health Act 1958; &lt;BR /&gt;	Minister administering the Port Phillip Authority Act 1966 in exercising his jurisdiction under section 9 of that Act.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Board had jurisdiction to hear and determine any matter in respect of which jurisdiction was conferred on it by the following acts; &lt;BR /&gt;	Drainage Areas Act 1958;  Health Act 1958;  Local Government Act 1958;  Town and Country Planning Act 1961;  Port Phillip Authority Act 1966;  Strata Titles Act 1967;  Environment Protection Act 1970;  Cluster Titles Act 1974;  Drainage of Land Act 1975;  any other act.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Board exercised its jurisdiction by hearing cases in divisions. A division could consist of between one and five members. When a division comprised more than one member, if neither the chief or deputy chief chairmen were part of the division, a senior member was appointed as chairman of the division. In such cases, determinations were made by majority vote of members of the division, with the chairman having the casting vote. The intention in constituting divisions was that the members hearing particular appeals would have legal or other knowledge and experience relevant to the appeal. The division which heard matters related to drainage was known as the Drainage Division.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Board could sit anywhere in Victoria as determined by the Chief Chairman but generally sat at Melbourne. Determinations of the Board were final and binding on all parties to the appeal. The only venue for appeal against determinations of the Board was to the Supreme Court. Such appeals against determinations could only be made on points of law.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Board was empowered to use a system of compulsory conferences of parties to an appeal prior to the appeal being heard. The purpose of the conferences was to clarify issues, identify questions of law and to attempt to resolve issues without the need to proceed to a full hearing.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Section 25 of Act 9512 provided that: &lt;BR /&gt;The Board-&lt;BR /&gt;(a)	Shall, in hearing any appeal, act according to equity and good conscience and the substantial merits of the case without regard to technicalities or legal forms; &lt;BR /&gt;(b)	is bound by the rules of natural justice; &lt;BR /&gt;(c)	is not required to conduct  any proceedings in a formal manner;  and&lt;BR /&gt;(d)	shall hear and determine appeals as quickly as is consistent with the requirements of justice.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Board further had discretion to accept evidence orally or written, under oath, affirmation or declaration. It could direct the Registrar to issue summonses to people to appear before the Board or to produce specified documents as evidence before the Board.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;1987 to ct&lt;BR /&gt;The Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1984 (No.10155) established the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT). The relevant sections of the Act came into operation on 5 December 1984. Section 19 of Act 10155 provided that the Tribunal would operate under two divisions, the General Division and the Taxation Division, as well as "such other divisions as are prescribed".&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Planning Appeals (Amendment) Act (9/1987) established the Planning Division of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal on 1 August 1987 as successor to the Planning Appeals Board (VA 1408). The Planning Division of the Tribunal had jurisdiction in relation to appeals under various sections of the following acts:&lt;BR /&gt;	Alpine Resorts;  Cluster Titles;  Drainage Areas;  Drainage of Land;  Environment Protection;  Extractive industries;  Health;  Historic Buildings;  Latrobe Regional Commission;  Local Government;  Mines;  Port Phillip Coastal Planning and Management;  Soil Conservation and Land Utilisation;  Strata Titles;  Town and Country Planning;  Transport Act;  Upper Yarra Valley and Dandenong Ranges Authority;  Water.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Further research into the history of the administration of these previously separate appeal functions has yet to be undertaken.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;From 1998 all appeals are to the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal. The Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal was established under the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 1998 as part of a package of reforms to improve the operation of the justice system. A number of tribunals were amalgamated standardising procedures and diminishing the enormous overlap that existed.  Appeals are dealt with by the Planning List of the Administrative Division of the Tribunal.&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background

In 1940 the first centrally controlled uniform building regulations were established under the Local Government Act 1928. Prior to this each municipality could make its own by-laws governing building regulation. The 1940 legislation established the Building Regulations Commission which was to prepare and submit draft building regulations to the Minister for Public Works (VRG 18). 

Under the Local Government Act 1958 the power to administer Uniform Building Regulations continue to be vested in municipalities (except where provided under Health Act, Sewerage Regulations and Water Supply Regulations which are subject to the approval of appropriate government authorities). The Uniform Building Regulations define detailed provisions for building operations and prescribe certain minimum standards which councils are bound to observe, however, councils have the power to insist on standards above those prescribed in the Regulations. Appeals against decisions by councils may be made to a panel of Referees.

Under the provisions of the Uniform Building Regulations, no building may be erected, constructed, placed in position, rebuilt, reconstructed, re-erected, replaced in position, altered, structurally altered, pulled down or removed unless it complies with the Local Government Act and Uniform Building Regulations and is approved by a council. A written permit must be obtained from the Council and a fee paid as prescribed.

Reforms 1990s

A number of agencies were established by the Building Act 1993, modelled on the national Model Building Act, which was passed to provide for the regulation of building and building standards reflecting best practice and innovation.

These agencies are:

	Building Advisory Council   to advise the Minister on the administration and impact of the Act on the building industry and community.
	Building Appeals Board   hears applications for modifications of the building regulations, disputes or appeals arising from the Act and appeals against decisions of the Building Practitioners Board.
	Building Control Commission   responsible for administering the building regulatory system.
	Building Practitioners Board   registers building practitioners, monitors their conduct and ability to practise.
	Building Regulations Advisory Committee   advises the Minister on regulations and provides accreditation of building products, construction methods, designs and components and systems associated with building work.</description>

Agriculture to 1985

In the early days of settlement, sheep suffered from diseases such as scab and catarrh.  Numerous regulations were made to prevent the spread of disease and for the provision of care for diseased stock on stations established for the purpose.  These regulations were administered by Stock Inspectors appointed by the Superintendent of Port Phillip (VRG 11) and later the Colonial Secretary (VRG 16) and the Chief Secretary (VRG 26).

The first official recognition of the part agriculture might play in the Victorian economy came with the establishment in 1859 of a Board of Agriculture within the Chief Secretary's portfolio by an Act for the Establishment of a Board of Agriculture (22 Vic., No.83). The Board consisted of the Chief Secretary, the Commissioner of Crown Lands and Survey, three persons appointed by the Governor-in-Council and representatives of Agricultural Societies. The Board's main business was to distribute Government grants in aid among agricultural societies, and to conduct an experimental farm at Royal Park.  It was also responsible for disseminating information about agricultural practices and conducting classes for the study of agriculture. The Board was abolished by an Act of 1870 (34 Vic., No.380) having failed to demonstrate its usefulness.

Large scale selection of land began early in the 1870's, in many cases by people with limited knowledge of farming, and it became obvious that some Government assistance and regulation would be necessary.  In 1872, a Minister of Agriculture (VRG 34) was appointed, taking over responsibility for functions previously administered by the Chief Secretary including the control of stock diseases and the right to destroy stock and compensate owners.  In the same year, a Department of Agriculture (VA 618) was established as a branch of the Department of Crown Lands and Survey (VA 538).

Initially the Agriculture Department comprised mainly stock and sheep inspectors, concerned with preventing the spread of disease and the eradication of sheep scab.  In the same year a Diseases in Stock Act was passed to prevent the spread of foot and mouth disease, and in 1873 outbreaks of phylloxera in Europe led to the proclamation of the Vine Diseases Act and under its provisions the prohibition of imports of vine cuttings to Victoria.

Later Stock Diseases and Vegetation and Vine Disease Acts made the Department responsible for the eradication of an ever-widening range of diseases, the prescription of quarantine areas, prohibition of the import, slaughtering and destruction of stock and the granting of compensation to owners.  This involved a much closer supervision of farming activities and in the case of cattle and pigs led to a series of Cattle and Swine Compensation Acts, which included the imposition of duties on sales to raise money for compensation to farmers whose stock was compulsorily destroyed.  This supervision of diseased stock was extended to bees in 1910.

About the late 1880's and the early 1890's the Department employed a chemist, an entomologist who dealt with noxious insects, and experts in dairying, fruit growing, wine making, drying fruit and growing perfume herbs.  From 1882 the Department of Agriculture was removed from the administration of the Department of Crown Lands and Survey and was established as a department in its own right.

Experimental farms were set up at Werribee and Rutherglen in 1912 and a number of others at various later dates, dealing with particular forms of agriculture of interest to particular districts.  

Some regulatory powers regarding marketing of primary produce, particularly of stock, had existed from early times under some sections of the Auction Sales Act.  They were made more specific by the Fruit Cases Act and the Fruit and Vegetable Packing and Sale Act, which regulated packing of fruit. The powers were expanded considerably in 1920 when dealers in farm produce were required to take out licences and further increased in 1935 when the Marketing of Primary Products Act led to the establishment of several marketing boards.

(Source:  Victorian Year Book 1971, p.105-108.)

Notes on the Divisional structure of the Department of Agriculture 

The Department of Agriculture operated through various divisions over time. 

Because of the frequent combination of cereal growing with sheep production, the management of sheep in relation to cropping developed as part of the responsibilities of the Division of Agriculture. That Division also advised on stock management on irrigated and dryland pastures.

The Division of Horticulture was created in 1923. It had previously been a branch of the Division of Agriculture. 

The Livestock Division undertook control and extension activities in relation to the animal industries. As supervision of shed and factory hygiene and standards in the dairying industry rapidly expanded, a separate Division of Dairying was established in 1934 from the Dairy Industry Branch of the Division. The Dairying Division in time extended its activities into the sphere of dairy cattle husbandry and pasture management.

The Divisions of Animal Industry and Animal Health were formed early in 1966 from the former Livestock Division. 

The Division of Animal Health became responsible for research and extension work in the field of animal diseases and control of stock diseases (including quarantine and preventative medicine and eradication of infectious diseases), artificial breeding and bee production. The Division also assumed responsibility for developing veterinary diagnostic services. 

The remaining staff and responsibilities of the Livestock Division were allotted to the Division of Animal Industry and the Pasture (Agrostology?) Branch was transferred to it from the Division of Agriculture. The Division of Animal Industry comprised five branches (Sheep Industry, Beef Industry, Pig Industry, Poultry Industry and Pastures) and two research centres (Pastoral Research Station, Hamilton and S.S.Cameron Animal Research Laboratory, Werribee) with a small research group at the Rutherglen Research Station and responsibility also for the development of a Turf Research and Advisory Institute at Frankston. Its activities were limited to research (in such areas as breeding, feeding, reproduction and management) and extension (including farm visits, short courses, media coverage and discussion groups) with no regulatory responsibility.

The Ellinbank Dairy Research Station was transferred from the Livestock Division to the Division of Dairying. 

Agriculture 1985 to 1992

In 1985 the Minister for Agriculture and Rural Affairs assumed responsibility for agriculture from the Minister for Agriculture.

By 1985 the chief responsibilities of the Minister were setting and regulating standards for primary production (apart from mining and forests), providing research and development as well as advisory and technical services to agriculture and rural industry, regulating marketing of products and developing marketing strategies and promoting trade.

In addition to the Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs and its regional offices, research institutes and experimental farms, the portfolio comprised a number of statutory authorities concerned with regulating rural industry and marketing its products, e.g. the Australian Barley Board, Citrus Fruit Marketing Board, Tobacco Leaf Marketing Board, Victorian Abattoir and Meat Inspection Authority, Victorian Dairy Industry Authority (VA 711) and the Victorian Egg Marketing Board.  The Market Trusts which manage the Melbourne Wholesale Fruit and Vegetable Market and Western Metropolitan Market also operated within this portfolio as did a number of industry negotiating and advisory committees, e.g. the Tomato Processing Industry Negotiating Committee and advisory committees.  

The Department was concerned with -
   	setting standards for, maintaining and improving agricultural productivity and product quality,
   	controlling, treating and eradicating plant, animal and product disease,
   	controlling pests and insects,
   	animal welfare,
   	regulating use of agricultural chemicals and fertilisers,
   	regulating and monitoring production and distribution of agricultural products (such as milk, fruit, eggs, vegetables, grain, poultry and livestock),
   	marketing and developing trade in agricultural products,

It provided research and development, advisory, technical and publication services to the industry to promote improved productivity, better quality produce, animal welfare and disease and pest control.  The Department developed general marketing strategies, promoted trade development and sponsored individual product promotions including fish marketing.  The Department also operated a Garden Advisory Service relating to home gardening and household pests.

The Department operated through an extensive network of regional offices which included research institutes and experimental farms.  Its research and development activities covered many fields, for example cropping, dairying, vegetables production, pastoral land use, animal husbandry, irrigation and salinity. The results informed the Department in its standard setting role and were disseminated to the industry through the advisory services provided by regional offices and the Department's publications.  DARATECH Pty. Ltd., a company wholly owned by the Victorian Government, commercialised the research and development work conducted by the Department and other government agencies.

Agriculture in the 1990s

From 1995, Agriculture was no longer administered by a separate Department.  Agriculture Victoria was part of the Department of Agriculture, Energy and Minerals.
The provision of a range of agricultural services continued under a regional structure which included all departmental research institutes, district offices and veterinary laboratories.  The Quality Assurance Division of the Department was responsible for the Animal and Chemical Standards Branches and the Market Reporting Section.  The Rural Policy and marketing Division dealt with policy advice and planning and the marketing of Victorian food.  Research and Development was supervised by the Office of the Chief Scientist.

Further administrative change in 1996 made the agriculture function part of the Department of Natural Resources and the Environment.  The Agriculture and Chief Scientist Division of the Department have responsibilities for the Agriculture Industries Program, the Agriculture Quality Assurance program and the quality of science in the Department.  Advice continues to be made available to producers, research is carried on by Agriculture Victoria at a number of research centres across the State and situated in production areas to assist and facilitate export development. Since 1998 DARATECH Pty Ltd has been known as Agriculture Victoria Services Pty Ltd,.

There have been substantial changes in the regulation of the marketing of agricultural products.  Authorities such as the Victorian Egg Marketing Board, Victorian Dairy Industry Authority and negotiating committees for other produce have been dissolved with marketing to be de-regulated.  Co-operative marketing of barley with South Australia through the Australian Barley Board has ceased with a  company becoming responsible and wheat marketing has become a wholly Commonwealth function.  Citrus marketing has continued to function under statutory authority through the Murray Valley Citrus Marketing Board established under complementary legislation in Victoria and New South Wales.

A number of statutory authorities  established under the Agricultural Industry Development Act 1990 and responsible to the Minister for Agriculture are designed to foster sustainable ind... truncated</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Society's attitudes to and understanding of intellectual disability have changed significantly since the 1840's. In the 1840s people with intellectual disability were controlled and treated in the same way as people with psychiatric illness or physical disability. The modern distinctions we are familiar with were not made. The development of services specifically aimed at the intellectually disabled emerged only as society began to classify people as intellectually disabled. Throughout the past century and a half there have been a number of classifications which are significant to the history of the function. What follows is a far from comprehensive account of some of the important developments. It is an outline only and further research is required. To assist researchers to locate the records they require it is necessary that the historical terms for intellectual disability be used in this account. It is acknowledged that this decision has resulted in the inclusion of terms which today are considered most offensive.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Institutionalisation of Idiots and Imbeciles&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Institutionalisation was the primary approach to managing societys problem persons in the nineteenth and early twentieth century. A variety of Lunacy Acts from 1843 to 1903 provided for the control of persons of unsound mind in Government run institutions or in  homes and institutions regulated by the Government. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1877 the Ballarat Asylum had been established for use as an "asylum for idiot children and harmless adult idiots" but it was closed after two years due to lack of funds and the patients were transferred to the Sunbury Asylum where they were admitted under the provisions of the Lunacy Statute.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;A Royal Commission on Asylums for the Insane and Inebriate was commissioned on 17 May 1884 and presented its report on 29 April 1886 (see Papers Presented to Parliament 1886, Vol.2 p.271). The Royal Commission, known as the Zox Commission after its Chairman, was required to inquire into and report on the state and condition of both public and  institutions and to make recommendations as to the management and inspection of institutions, the classification and treatment of patients and the training and qualifications of medical personnel. The Commission recommended the establishment of a separate institution for the treatment of "idiots".&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1887 the Children's Cottages at Kew (VA 2852) were opened as the Idiot Ward of the Kew Asylum. The institution was established to provide separate accommodation in the form of detached cottages for "idiot" and "imbecile" children who had previously been accommodated with adult patients.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1932 a special school staffed by teachers seconded from the Education Department (VA 0714) was opened at the Children's Cottages Kew (VA 2852). &lt;BR /&gt; 2861) was established for the, shelter, care and education of less severely retarded children from 5 years up to 16. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Pleasant Creek special school at Stawell commenced admissions in February 1937.&lt;BR /&gt;In November 1937 Janefield (VA 2847) was opened as a mental defectives colony for the accommodation and training (intellectually and occupationally) of idiot babies and young, low grade imbecile children offering relief to the Childrens Cottages at Kew.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;During 1937 the differing requirements of mental defectives were recognised in the administration of the Mental Hygiene Department by the establishment of a Mental Defectives Branch. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;During the 1950s day centres became popular. The day centre movement received support from the Government in the purchase and erection of premises and the training of supervisors. The senior psychologist in the Mental Hygiene Department was appointed as an inspector and advisor to the day centres. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1956 the State run institutions for intellectually defectives included the four hospitals at Travancore, Stawell, Kew Cottages and Janefield, a training centre for boys at Bendigo and a hostel for girls at Moorakyne. It was noted in the Annual Report of the Mental Hygiene Authority for 1956 that there was still no separate accomodation for intellectually defective adults nor was there appropriate legislation to clearly distinguish between the mentally ill and the intellectually defective.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Gradually the focus became on the development of services and support systems to enable the intellectually disabled to remain as independent as possible within the community. This strategy was accompanied by a corresponding program of deinstitutionalisation. In 1981 the Commission was operating thirteen residential training centres and sixty day training centres as well as subsidising four  training centres. Support services were also provided to persons attending Education Department special schools and special development schools. The separation of a Mental Retardation Division from  the Mental Health Division in 1981 was viewed as a major step towards recognising the different needs of mentally retarded persons (Annual Report of the Health Commission of Victoria 1980/81).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Establishment of the Community Services Portfolio&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In March 1985 a Minister for Community Services was appointed and assumed responsibility for all community welfare programmes administered by the Minister for Community Welfare (VRG 60).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Following a review of the provision of health services many services which had been traditionally regarded as health services were redefined as community services and responsibility for these functions was transferred to the Minister for Community Services.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;On 1 October 1985, the Minister for Community Services became responsible for the administration of the Office of Intellectual Disability Services and thus for the administration of programmes and institutions providing services to intellectually disabled adults and children.  These services had previously been provided by the Mental Retardation Division of the Health Commission (VA 2577) and very briefly by the Department of Health II (VA 2695).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Many of these services were provided on a regional basis and there was a Regional Services Division within the Department of Community Services (VA 2633) which was responsible for the delivery of services through Community Services Victoria regional offices and facilities, local government, non-government agencies and the community sector.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Intellectual Disability Services included:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;early childhood and early intervention services&lt;BR /&gt;vocational services&lt;BR /&gt;residential care in centres known variously as training centres, hostels and community centres&lt;BR /&gt;community support services&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Intellectually Disabled Persons Services Act 1986&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Principles stated in this Act expressed the overall view that intellectually disabled persons have the same rights as other members of the community, that their needs best met by maximum integration in the community, that they were entitled to exercise maximum control over every aspect of their life, that services should be provided  within local communities and that these should be funded by the State, that the State had a duty to ensure that organisations providing services were able to be held accountable for their nature and provision and that non-government organisations should be able to continue to play a significant role in the provision of services.  The intellectually disabled were seen as having a legitimate and major role to play in planning and evaluating services.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Criteria for eligibility were stated by the Act with these being later amended by the Intellectually Disabled persons Services (Amendment) Act 1994.  For each person, there is an obligation to prepare a general service plan in consultation with the person, the primary carer and other persons considered suitable.  This plan is subject to regular review.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Intellectual Disability Planning Committees might be appointed for each region to be responsible for preparing 3-year plans for the provision of intellectual disability services in the region.  These plans are required to identify the needs of eligible residents, state how the needs were currently being met and identify improvements to be made in the facilities available.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Residential institutions, properly proclaimed under the Act were able to remain.  Services provided by non-Government providers were able to be funded by the State providing those services met the criteria laid down in the Act.  Residential institutions and programs were able to be inquired into and inspected by community visitors to report upon the appropriateness and standard of facilities, the adequacy of opportunities and programs, whether services were being provided in accordance with the principles laid down in the Act and to investigate any resident complaints.  &lt;BR /&gt;All persons involved in residential facilities was to be provided with a printed copy of their rights with explanations to be made to those unable to read or comprehend the printed material.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Intellectual Disability Review Panel was established with the primary role of receiving and hearing complaints about reviewable decisions made by the Department, its registered agencies, centres and residential institutions.  The panel also has a responsibility in monitoring the use of restraint, seclusion and aversive therapy.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Administration&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Since c1991, all Disability Services including those for the intellectually disabled have been administered by the Disability Services Division of the Department of Community Services and later the Department of Health and Community Services and the Department of Human Services.  As of may 2001 the Division consists of the:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Performance, Planning and Research section concerned with intergovernmental relations, performance analysis and reporting;  information and data strategies and disability research projects; &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Service and Quality development providing integrated service development including new service models, contestable purchasing and purchasing frameworks and&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Budget and program Support including the Disability Services Training Unit responsible for delivering training to staff employed in Government managed disability services.&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In June 1981 the Disabled Persons Information Bureau replaced the Handicapped Persons Information Bureau. The new name reflected contemporary attitudes toward disabled people. The Bureau was responsible for disseminating information to supporters of disabled people, advocacy for disabled people, assistance with policy formation and liaison with government departments. (Health Commission of Victoria, Annual Report, 1980/81).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Responsibility for services to people with physical and sensory disabilities was transferred to the Department of Community Services on 1 October 1985. The rationale behind this transfer was the belief that people with disabilities are not ill but require extra community support. The functions transferred included program development, administration of funding to non-government organisations, provision of an information service and policy advice. The Department of Community Services also staffed the Victorian Consultative Council on Rehabilitation, which had been established in 1981. The Council provided advice to the Minister on disability and rehabilitation issues. (Community Services Victoria, Annual Report, 1985/86).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;In 1985 further major changes in the administration and provision of health services were given effect by a series of Administrative Arrangement Orders, (numbers 30, 31, 36, 37, 41 and 42), amendments to the Public Service Act 1974 and the Health Amendment Act 1985 (No.10262).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Following a review of the provision of health services many services which had been traditionally regarded as health services were redefined as community services and responsibility for these functions was transferred to the Department of Community Services (VA 2633).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In May 1985 the Department of Community Services became responsible for pre-school services including the administration of pre-school centres, child minding centres and services for the care of pre-school children (other than those which catered exclusively for intellectually disabled pre-school children).  (See also VA 2868 Committee of Review of Early Childhood Services.)&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Department of Community Services also became responsible for the administration of a number of benevolent societies and institutions listed in Schedule Two of Administrative Arrangements Order No.37 1985.  The institutions and organisations listed provide services to children, families, the aged and people with physical and sensory disabilities.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The major responsibilities of the Department were,&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Child Development and Care including:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;   	pre-school and child care services&lt;BR /&gt;   	child care centres&lt;BR /&gt;   	child minding regulations &lt;BR /&gt;   	aboriginal pre-school services.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;From 1990, Child Care and Pre-School Services were transferred to the Office ofPreSchool and Child Care Services under a Minister responsible for Child Care.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Following significant machinery of government changes after the election of the first Kennett Government in October 1992, the Department of Health and Community Services was established by Administrative Arrangements Order No.114. The Department of Health and Community Services assumed all functions from the Department of Community Services (VA 2633) including the Office of Pre-School and Child Care.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In further significant machinery of government changes after the re-election of the Kennett Government in April 1996, the Department of Health and Community Services was abolished. All functions were transferred to the Department of Human Services (VA 3970) on 3 April 1996 under Administrative Arrangements Order No.150.&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background

In 1882 a Royal Commission was empowered to inquire into the "alleged evils arising from the protracted hours of labour of employees in connection with retail shops and trading establishments". Employees in retail trading establishments had for some years been promoting shorter opening hours through an Early Closing Association and through the Salesmen's and Assistants' Union. The actions of these associations had at times gained support but this was usually spoilt by a number of traders who resumed protracted hours of opening. The Commissioners investigated the case of both the employees and employers and in their second progress report, dated 12 July 1883, were convinced of the absolute necessity for legislative action. They believed that the obligations of humanity were paramount to those of trade and therefore saw justification in interfering in the relations of employer and employee to seek to do through legislation that which the employers and employees had been unable to accomplish themselves.

The Factories and Shops Act 1885 (49 Vic., No.862), which became operative March 1886, provided for prescription of shop closing hours (in metropolitan areas only) unless the type of shop was specifically exempted. The Factories and Shops Act 1896 further introduced provisions regulating the sale and delivery of bread, milk and meat on certain days. These latter provisions were introduced to protect shopkeepers who were required to abide with the provisions that prescribed shop closing hours. Regulations regarding street trading were the responsibility of municipalities (see VRG 12). The legislation regulating retail trading hours aimed at reconciling the situation between shop owners, shop assistants and shoppers and between groups of shop owners.

The Labour and Industry Act 1953 revised and consolidated the provisions of the Factories and Shops Acts, and included provisions with respect to precription of shop opening hours, in addition to shop closing hours.

Responsibility for this function had been assumed by the Minister of Labour in 1900 from the Chief Secretary (VRG 26). In 1954 the Minister of Labour and Industry assumed responsibility for all functions previously exercised by the Minister of Labour.

A Ministerial Advisory Committee on Shop Trading Hours (VA 1311) was established in October 1982 with the following terms of reference:
	to provide personal advice to the Minister of Labour and Industry in the context of the Government's policy that there should be no extension of shop trading hours and consistent with the Government's policy of support for small business

	to examine in detail the current trading hours provisions of the Labour and Industry Act 1958 and advise the Minister on the need for any legislative or administrative changes to further the Government's policy objectives and possible changes required to simplify, make more comprehensible or remove anomalies or inconsistencies from existing legislation.
The Committee was expected to submit its third report in September 1984. 

In March 1985 responsibility for the shop trading provisions of the Labour and Industry Act 1958 were transferred to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Resources (VRG 82) by Administrative Arrangements Order (No.17) 1985, however, the Department of Employment and Industrial Affairs (later Department of Labour II) (VA 2777) continued to enforce shop trading requirements on an agency basis for the Department of Industry, Technology and Resources.

The Shop Trading Act 1987 came into operation 21 November 1987 replacing the provisions of the Labour and Industry Act 1958 which related to trading hours and registration of shops.

Responsibility for the Shop Trading Act was transferred from the Department of Industry, Technology and Resources (VA 2661) to the Ministry of Consumer Affairs in February 1989. The Department of Labour II (VA 2777) continued to enforce shop trading requirements on an agency basis until at least 1990.

The Capital City (Shop Trading) Act 1992 deregulated trading hours for the central business district and Southbank.  In 1996 the Shop Trading Reform Act was passed which repealed both the Shop Trading Act 1987 and the Capital City (Shop Trading) Act 1992.  This act defined ordinary shop closing hours including the special provisions for Christmas Day, Good Friday and Anzac Day.  A list of shops exempt from ordinary hours is given in the Schedule of the Act.  Municipalities were also empowered under the Local Government Act to make local laws regarding shop trading hours.

In October 1992 responsibility passed from the Minister for Consumer Affairs to the Minister for Small Business (VRG 101). The Office of Small Business within the Department of Business and Employment became responsible for administration of shop trading legislation until 1996 when, after further substantial legislative change the function moved to the Department of State Development under the supervision of the Minister of Industry, Science and Technology.  Since 1999, the Minister of State and Regional Development has been responsible for the oversight of retail trading hours.</description>

       <description type="full">Background

The Neglected Children's Act 1887 (51 Vic.,No 941) provided for penalties to be imposed on anyone employing a child under a certain age (the age at which attendance at school ceased to be compulsory by law) who was not registered. Application for registration of a child was to be made by a parent or guardian to a Clerk of Petty Sessions and required the furnishing of a certificate from a school inspector or headmaster confirming the child had been educated to the correct standard. Registration was for one year only. The Neglected Children's Act was superseded by the Children's Welfare Act in 1924.

In 1925 the Street Trading Act 1925 introduced the regulation of males under 12 and females under 21 with respect to street trading.

By 1954 the Children's Welfare Act provided for the prohibition of employing children other than those holding a permit issued by the Director of the Children's Welfare Department. At this time the regulation of child employment was extended to cover employment of children in public entertainment.

Division 9 of Part II of the Social Welfare Act 1970 (No.8089) superseded the Children's Welfare Act with respect to the granting of permits and licences to authorize children to be engaged in employment or street trading as defined by the Act.

In September 1987 responsibility for the sections of the Community Welfare Services Act 1970 relating to the employment of children was transferred by Administrative Arrangement Order (No.54) from the Minister for Community Services to the Minister for Labour.

In October 1992 responsibility was transferred from the Minister for Labour (VRG 86) to the Minister for Industry and Employment (VRG 116) and then in December 1992 to the Minister for Industry Services (VRG 108).  From 1996 to 1999 the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology had responsibility which was transferred to the Minister for Industrial Relations in 1999.

In 2003, the Child Employment Act 2003 (No. 81/2003) was passed. It provided an overview of the general working conditions for children under 15 and set out other requirements, including the need for police checks and permits, penalties that applied to any offence related to the employment of children, and exemptions to the Act. Responsibility for administering this Act remained with the Minister for Industrial Relations.</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In consequence of the increase in unemployment during 1929 and the early part of 1930 Parliament considered measures for the provision of moneys for the relief of unemployment and in May 1930 two Acts were passed - the Unemployment Relief Act 1930 (No.3866) and the Stamps (Unemployment Relief) Act 1930 (No.3868) - authorising the raising of a certain amount of moneys. The increase in unemployment continued and, in December 1930, the Unemployment Relief Amendment Act 1930 (No.3948) was passed providing for the raising of additional moneys. The amending Act also provided for the appointment of an Unemployment Relief Works Board which was constituted on 13 January 1931 with power to approve certain allocations of moneys from the Unemployment Relief Fund for unemployment relief works. Up to December 1931 allocations were made to:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;	 Lands Department, for land settlement and single men's camps&lt;BR /&gt;	 Mines Department, for grants to miners and assistance to prospectors&lt;BR /&gt;	 Country Roads Board, for making roads for isolated settlers&lt;BR /&gt;	 Forests Commission, for single men's camps&lt;BR /&gt;	 Public Works, for subsidies to municipalities&lt;BR /&gt;	 State Rivers and Water Supply Commission.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Unemployment Relief (Amendment) Act 1932 (No.4023) provided for the establishment of the Employment Council of Victoria to consider and recommend methods for the prevention and relief of unemployment. The Council superseded the Unemployment Relief Works Board. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;During the war years the expenditure from the Fund on relief works reduced considerably until by 1945 it appears that the only relief works were undertaken at the Zoo. It is not clear when the Employment Council of Victoria ceased to operate although it was still reporting to the Treasurer/Premier until at least March 1945.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;SOURCES:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Unemployment Relief Works Board, Report for the Quarter Ended 31 December 1931 (in Papers Presented to Parliament, Second Session 1932)&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Divorce and Matrimonial Causes Act 1861 (No.125) conferred upon the Supreme Court of Victoria, jurisdiction in matters matrimonial and authority in certain cases to decree the dissolution of a marriage. This remained the case until the passing of the Commonwealth Family Law Act 1975. Until 1861 divorce was a matter for the ecclesiastical courts. This was also the situation in England until 1857/58. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The grounds for obtaining a divorce were virtually unchanged from 1861 to 1976. Section 5 of the original Act stated that, a divorce might be obtained either by the husband or wife on the grounds of adultery or cruelty or of desertion without cause for a period of two years.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Divorce proceedings commenced when the husband or wife or their legal representative (known as a Proctor) lodged a Petition for Dissolution of Marriage at the Prothonotarys Office. The party seeking the divorce was called the petitioner and the other person the respondent. In cases of adultery, the respondents alleged sexual partner was named on the Petition for Dissolution of Marriage as the co-respondent.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Every decree for dissolution or nullity of marriage was, in the first instance, a Decree Nisi or provisional judgement. The decree became Absolute after three months provided that no party showed cause that the Courts decision was obtained by collusion, or that material facts were not previously disclosed to the Court. The Decree established the parties;  presiding judge;  date of hearing;  order of Nisi on grounds of either desertion, adultery or cruelty;  an order of the costs to be paid by the respondent;  and a decision regarding the custody and maintenance of children.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;When a divorce became Absolute both parties were then free to re-marry. If either party was dissatisfied with the decision of the Court they could, within three months of the Decree Nisi, lodge an appeal to the Full Court of the Supreme Court. A further appeal could then be lodged with the Privy Council in London. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The original Act also gave the Court the power to set alimony payments (section 19) and make orders as to the custody of children (section 22).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1976, with the proclamation of the Federal Family Law Act, responsibility for the determination of divorce cases was transferred to the Commonwealth.&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The functions relating to major projects were established by the Urban Land Authority Act 1979 (No.9320).   The main responsibility of the portfolio was to co-ordinate projects relating to government-owned sites considered to be of importance to the State through the acquisition, development and sale of land.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;A Minister responsible for Major Projects was first appointed in 1987 and assumed responsibility for major state projects involving the development and sale of government land from the Minister for Housing (VRG 53).  The creation of a separate portfolio for Major Projects reflected the Government's concern to promote the efficient use of government owned land.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Responsibility for carrying out this function lies with the Office of Major Projects (known as the Major Projects Unit 1987  1992) and a number of the powers established by the Urban Land Authority Act, 1979 (No.9320) have been delegated to the Office of Major Projects, in respect of projects designated as major projects.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Office of Major Projects&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Office of Major Projects is responsible for major projects assigned to it by the Government.  The modus operandi of the Unit is for the Government to formally assign responsibility for specified approved projects to the Unit.  Any liabilities arising from Government approved activities are the responsibility of the State.  The Minister responsible formally assigns responsibility in accordance with the Premier's order of 13 February 1987 and Section 4 (1) (c) of the Urban Land Authority Act (No.9320).  Initially there were eight projects managed by the Unit, all of them important to the development of inner Melbourne.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Office works closely with all the relevant government departments.  The Unit brings together people with management skills from a number of departments and agencies and uses the services of consultants and  contractors.  Recruitment is primarily through secondment and contract employment.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Each project is headed by a Project Director, supported by a small project team assembled from the  and public sectors.  Project Directors report through the Director of the Unit to the Minister and are supported by a core staff who provide legal and financial expertise.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Functions&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The functions of the Office include acquisition, consolidation and preparation of sites.  Its task is to facilitate the development of large strategically significant areas of government-owned land for commercial, tourist and residential purposes.  It is responsible for major state projects assigned to it by the Government.  It provides a central contact point for  developers interested in investing in major government projects.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Unit has the authority to invite tenders, evaluate competitive development proposals, select developers, facilitate planning approvals, execute financial and legal agreements and supervise construction.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Some of the projects managed by the Unit are&lt;BR /&gt;   	Bayside&lt;BR /&gt;   	Lynch's Bridge&lt;BR /&gt;   	South Bank&lt;BR /&gt;   	Prince Henry's Hospital&lt;BR /&gt;   	Jolimont Railyards&lt;BR /&gt;   	Willesmere Hospital Site&lt;BR /&gt;   	World Congress Centre&lt;BR /&gt;   	Redevelopment of the State Library&lt;BR /&gt;   	Docklands (proposed Olympic Games Village)&lt;BR /&gt;   	Queen Victoria Hospital&lt;BR /&gt;   	Museum and National Gallery of Victoria redevelopment and State Library redevelopment&lt;BR /&gt;   	Old Treasury &lt;BR /&gt;	Federation Square&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background

    The first legislation to protect native plants and flowers was introduced in 1930 as a result of community (naturalists associations etc.) agitation for a means to stop "tourists" from removing plants and flowers from public and  land which was seen to be resulting in the extinction of indigenous plants. 

	Under the legislation specific plants proclaimed by the Governor in Council were protected and periods of protection could be specified or left unlimited. Provision was made for licences to pick plants for scientific purposes to be approved by the Minister on the recommendation of the Forests Commission. Rangers and honorary rangers policed the provisions of Act. 

More general management and conservation of native plants was also undertaken by a range of government agencies as part of the exercise of their substantive duties.  These agencies included the National Parks Authority/Service (VA 549), the Victorian Forests Commission (VA 534), the Department of Crown Lands and Survey (VA 538);  and the Land Conservation Council (VA 1410).

Reforms after 1988

In 1988 the Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act was passed with the purpose of establishing a legal and administrative structure to enable and promote the conservation of Victorias native flora and fauna.  The objectives of the Act were:

to guarantee the survival, flourishing and evolutionary development of flora and fauna in the wild

to conserve communities of flora

to manage potentially threatening processes

to ensure any human use was sustainable

to ensure that the genetic diversity is maintained

to provide programs of community education

to encourage co-operative management 

to assist and give incentives for the conservation of flora.

The carrying out of the functions of the Act was to be achieved by the establishment of a unit in the relevant Government Department and the establishment  of the Scientific Advisory Committee.  The Committee consists of three senior government scientific officers, two scientists from a Victorian educational institution and two scientists not employed in Government.  The Committee members are required to have expertise in a range of areas specified in the Act.  The role of the Committee is to consider nominations for the addition of threatened species , communities and potentially threatening processes. The Committee provides advice to the Minister on these nominations and other conservation matters.  The Act also gave the Land Protection Council, Land Protection Regional Advisory Committees and the Conservation Advisory Committee the right to provide advice to the Minister with regard to the Act.

The responsible officer is obligated to prepare a Flora and Fauna Guarantee Strategy with drafts to be publicised for public comment and submissions.  Determinations of critical habitats may be made, though locations may be withheld.  The officer also has the right to prepare management plans for the protection of potentially threatened species with notice having to be publicly given.  The responsible officer may also enter into Public Authority Management Agreements with public authorities for the management of any community of flora or any threatening process.  Interim Conservation Orders may be issued for the conservation of critical habitats.  Appeals against any of these could be made to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and , from 1998, the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal.

If flora are declared to be protected species, a licence is required for the taking, trading in, keeping, moving an processing of the flora.  Penalties may be imposed for the taking of any of these actions without licence or permit.</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Following separation from New South Wales and the establishment of the Crown Colony of Victoria, responsibility for the management of the colony's legal system including the administration of the courts was shared by two colonial officers, the Attorney General and the Solicitor General, both of whom were members of the Legislative Council.  The Attorney General was also a member of the Executive Council.  The practice of joint ministerial responsibility was continued after the achievement of responsible government in 1855 until 1951 when, under the provisions of the Solicitor General Act 1951 (No.5604) the office of the Solicitor General became non-ministerial and the Attorney General assumed responsibility for those functions previously administered by the Solicitor General.  In 1985 the Premier (VRG 50) became responsible for the Solicitor General.  In some ministries during the period 1861 to 1891, the Solicitor General was known as the Minister of Justice.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Although the division of ministerial responsibilities was not constant for the entire period 1851 to 1951, the Attorney General was usually responsible for the administration of the Supreme Court and its officers and their staff who were employed within the Law Department.  The Officers of the Supreme Court included the Master in Equity (also known as the Master in Equity and Lunacy 1867-1923) (VA 2624), the Master of the Supreme Court (VA 2613), the Registrar of Probates (VA 2620), the Sheriff and the Prothonotary.  The Attorney General was responsible for Judges' Associates who attended the Judges, empanelled juries and kept records of verdicts and the Judges' notes.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Solicitor General/Minister of Justice were traditionally responsible for the staff and administration of the County Courts, Courts of General Sessions, Courts of Requests, Courts of Petty Sessions, Courts of Mines, Licensing Courts, Coroners Courts and Children's Courts and were thus responsible for Police (later Stipendiary) Magistrates, Wardens, Clerks of Court and Coroners.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Currently, the Attorney-General, through the Department of Justice remains responsible for the administration of the courts.&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;An Act providing for the inspection and regulation of boilers came into operation on 1 March 1907. The Boilers Inspection Act 1906 (6 Edw.VII, No.2071) primarily applied to each city, town and borough although provisions relating to the reporting of accidents applied also to the shires of Victoria. The Act was initially administered by the Department of Mines through the Chief Mining Inspector. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Chief Mining Inspector also exercised responsibility for inspection of mine boilers (along with mine machinery, ventilation, sanitation, safety appliances etc.) under the Mines Act 1904, and the Coal Mines Regulation Act. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In the Report of the Royal Commission on the State Public Service, 1917, it was noted that the inspection of boilers under the Boilers Inspection Act had no necessary connection with the Mines Department as boilers used in connection with gold or coal mining operations were exempt from the operation of the Act.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Part B of the Second Schedule to the Labour and Industry Act 1953 had provided for the transfer of the Boilers Inspection Act 1958 to the administration of the Minister of Labour and Industry. On 25 November 1962 the administration of the Act was transferred from the Minister of Mines, and the Boilers Inspection Branch became a branch of the Department of Labour and Industry. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;SOURCES:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Secretary for Mines and Water Supply, Annual Report 1906 (in Papers Presented to Parliament, Session 1907 Vol.2)&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Secretary for Mines, Annual Report, 1907&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background

From the time of first permanent settlement in Victoria licences authorising the sale and supply of liquor were granted by justices of the peace at Annual General Licensing Meetings held in June every year.  Following the English tradition of heavy control and excise of the licensing trade, over 40 Acts and Statutes were passed by the Victorian legislature between 1852 and the turn of the century.

The Act 3 Wm IV, No.8 (June 1833) provided for a General Meeting of the justices acting in and for each district in the Colony to be held in June each year and to be called the General Annual Licensing Meeting for the special purpose of considering all applications for licences for public houses.  Three justices at least were required to be present.  The justices were empowered to grant certificates authorising the issue of a licence.  These certificates and the fee were then required to be lodged with the office of the Collector of Internal Revenue (Colonial Treasurer, New South Wales) who upon receipt would issue and register the licences.

The Act also established Special General Sessions of the justices for the transferring of licences.  All offences under the Act were to be heard at Courts of Quarter Sessions.

The Act 8 Wm IV, No.8 (1837) provided for the application of the 1833 legislation in the newly established Port Phillip District and empowered an officer, to be appointed by the Governor-in-Council, to issue publicans licences in lieu of the Colonial Treasurer in Sydney.  The first officer authorised to do so was the Police Magistrate, Port Phillip District, William Lonsdale in September 1837.  However by 1839 the Sub-Treasurer had been appointed to issue licences for the Port Phillip District.

The Act regulating the sale and supply of liquor in the Port Phillip District at time of separation in 1851 was 13 Vic.,No.29 (1849).  This Act did not substantially alter the liquor licensing law, continuing the system of General Annual Licensing Meetings within each district for the hearing of applications for licences but allowing for a bench of two justices of the peace when a third was unavailable.

The Act provided for three types of licences, a publican's general licence, a packet licence (ship) and a confectioner's licence.  The latter licence was confined to the sale of spruce beer and ginger beer.  An 1854 Act 17 Vic.,No.24 provided for the registration of spirit merchants.  Act 25 Vic.,No.147 (1862) introduced a requirement for distiller's licences, wine grower's and brewer's licences.

Licensing Benches in Courts of Petty Sessions

In 1864, all then existing statutes were repealed and replaced by the Wines, Beer and Spirits Sale Act 1864 27 Vic.,No.227 which first introduced the single bottle or grocer's licence to be held only by a spirit merchant.

This Act abolished the General Annual Licensing Meetings and provided for the granting and transferring of licences to be a judicial proceeding within any sitting of the Court of Petty Sessions within a district.

Under the provisions of the Wines, Beers and Spirits Sale Act 1870 (34Vic.,No.390) the power to grant licences to be issued under the Act within each district was restricted to a Licensing Bench composed of a stipendiary magistrate and two other justices of the peace, nominated by the majority of and from amongst the justices resident within each licensing district.  All applications for the granting, renewal, transfer or forfeiture of licences were to be heard by these appointed magistrates.

Quarterly licensing meetings were to be held at each of the courts of petty sessions within a licensing district each year.  Magistrate's were bound to give a months notice of the licensing meetings in the Government Gazette.

The Act also allowed a municipal body to object to the granting of a licence in a district where there were already a sufficient number of licensed premises.  The Act provided that on such an objection a poll should be taken in the neighbourhood, introducing for the first time the concept of the reduction of liquor licences.

Licensing Courts were also supported, from 1876, by Inspectors of Liquor whose job it was to maintain the standard of liquor sold to the public and to ensure that it was unadulterated and fit for consumption.  The position was apparently joined with that of Inspectors of Distilleries (Licensed Premises) and operated within the Trade and Customs area as part of the excise and customs function.  In the years 1900 to 1901 when the customs function passed to the Commonwealth the Inspectors of Liquor were placed under the authority of the Minister of Public Health The function has apparently remained with the Health portfolio and although there were no Inspectors of Liquor as such post c1978 the duties may possibly still be undertaken as part of the general health investigations area.

District Licensing Courts

The Licensing Act 1885 (40 Vic.,No.857) replaced the previous Licensing Benches with a separate Licensing Court for each licensing district to be constituted by three police magistrates except in the districts of Melbourne, Geelong and Sandhurst (Bendigo) where the chairman of the court was to be a County Court Judge.  The Act also subjected licensed premises to the control and supervision of a Licensing Inspector who was empowered both to inspect premises and to give such reports and make orders as would ensure the maintenance of standards.  Licensing Inspectors were appointed from the police force by the Governor.

The Licensing Court would send duplicates of all certificates for licenses granted to the Treasurer, who continued to register and issue all liquor licenses.  All fees, fines, penalties and forfeitures were to be paid to the Treasurer to be placed in a trust fund called the Licensing Act 1885 Fund which was to be applied to the carrying out of the provisions of the Act.

The Licensing Courts had jurisdiction over all matters relating to:

	the granting or refusal of all applications for licences to be issued under the provisions of the Act
	the revocation, forfeiture, or cancellation of such licences
	the imposition of penalties authorised by the Act
	hearings of appeals from inspector's orders
	the disqualification of licensed persons and premises.

The 1870 legislation empowered the licensing magistrate to approve or refuse all applications for entertainment licences for licensed premises and required the magistrate to forward lists of all applications to the agency responsible, the Chief Secretary's Department 


Licensing Court of Victoria

The Licensing Act 1916 (No.2855) made provision for the concentration of the whole jurisdiction with regard to the granting of licences and their control and supervision under the newly constituted Licensing Court of Victoria (ss.34-37).

The new Court consisted of three magistrates, where formerly this function had been administered throughout Victoria by twenty police magistrates and three County Court judges  Each of the persons holding office as a member of the Licences Reduction Board was, under the Act, immediately deemed to have been appointed a Licensing Magistrate (s.35).  Centralised administration was achieved with the appointment of the Secretary of the Licences Reduction Board as the Registrar of the new court.

The system of licensing inspectors was continued, the duties of inspecting premises and enforcing the provisions of the Act being undertaken by nominated members of the police force who were not to be below the rank of sub-inspector.  An additional duty of the inspectors was to submit an annual report to the Court.

Hearings were held on a circuit basis in courts of petty sessions appointed by the Governor-in-Council as licensing courts to serve various licensing districts.  Notification of the annual sittings of the courts and their location appeared in the Government Gazettes.

The clerks of such courts would undertake the role of Licensing Clerk and would administer all licensing business in the locality and report directly to the Registrar of the Licensing Court.

Prior to the passing of the Licensing Amendment Act 1922 (No.3259) there were two hundred and seventeen licensing districts in Victoria each consisting of one division of an electoral district.  However section six of the new legislation provided that an entire electoral district should be the licensing district, thereby reducing the number to sixty-five.

The Licensing Court had jurisdiction over all matters relating to:

(	the granting or refusal of all applications for licences to be issued under the provisions of the Act; 
(	the revocation ,forfeiture, or cancellation of such licences; 
(	the imposition of penalties authorised by the Act; 
(	hearings of appeals from inspector's orders; 
(	the disqualification of licensed persons and premises.

The 1922 Act also empowered the Court to approve plans and to order the provision of additional accommodation and improvements where it thought them desirable section fourteen.



Victorian Licensing Court

The Victorian Licensing Court came into operation on 30 June 1954.  It was constituted under the Licensing Amendment Act 1953 (No.5767) and assumed the functions of the Licensing Court of Victoria.

The new Court was to be under the Chairmanship of a Judge of the County Court, the two other members being magistrates, with tenure extended from three to seven years (s.8).

The Act also made provision for the appointment of a Supervisor of Licenced Premises (s.11) who was aided by nine assistant supervisors.  The duties of the office included examining and reporting upon the nature and extent of hotel accommodation for the public and the provision made for the supply of meals and refreshments in hotels;  consulting with licensing inspectors on proposed plans for new licensed premises, or alterations and extensions to existing hotels and clubs and reporting to the Court re same;  and generally assisting the Licensing Court (s.11.2-4).  The new Supervisor's Department of the Victorian Licensing Court was staffed by members of the Police Force.

The Court had complete jurisdiction over the granting, transfer, cancellation and supervision of all liquor licences, with authority to impose penalties, hear evidence taken under oath and administer all related permits. Under the new legislation the functions of the Court were extended to include the control and supervision of "sanitation, hygiene, ventilation, cooling, heating, fire prevention and the cleanliness of food in all licensed premises".
  
For the purpose of reviewing licences annually the Licensing Court held Annual Sittings usually in November and December.  Applications for renewal were made by all licensees , country licensees setting down their applications with the Licensing Clerk for that particular area.  A magistrate held a sitting on the appointed day in the Court House at each of the prescribed centres.

The Court was not restricted as to the number of licences that it had the power to grant, the State having been constituted as one licensing district by the 1953 legislation (s.2).  In the event of a cancellation of a licence the Court sat as the Licences Reduction Board in order to fix compensation.  In 1968, the Victorian Licensing Court was abolished and the Liquor Control Commission (VA 1110) assumed all the responsibilities associated with liquor licensing in Victoria.</description>

       <description type="full">Background

The Historic Buildings Act 1981 (the first Act was proclaimed in 1974) applied to buildings of architectural or historical interest. "Building" is defined very broadly in the legislation and includes: interiors, parts of buildings and "appurtenances thereto" as well as any structure, work or object. Land in the same ownership as a building might also be registered to protect it against development or subdivision where such action would lessen the historic or architectural significance of the building but land alone could not be registered. Precincts could not be registered, nor could items of cultural or scientific interest, or ruins, although these might be the subject of planning scheme controls under the Planning and Environment Act 1987.

Under the Historic Buildings Act privately owned buildings which were of "historic" or "architectural significance" could be protected and assistance given for their upkeep. 

Government owned buildings of "historic" or "architectural significance" which were still used for government purposes and which were not on a crown land reserve (i.e., were situated on government land) could, after 1989, be protected under the same legislation. 

Buildings of sufficient architectural and historical significance were added to the Register of Historic Buildings. Additions to or removals from the register were Governor-in-Council decisions on the advice of the Minister. The Minister was under no compulsion to act on the recommendation of the Historic Buildings Council to add to the Register;  nor was he or she prevented by the Act from advising the Governor in Council to remove buildings from the Register in the absence of advice from the Historic Buildings Council. There was no avenue of appeal against a decision for the Minister to add, not add, or remove buildings from the Register. Registration was aimed at preventing summary demolition or alteration of buildings. A repair order might be served on the owner of a registered building to prevent a building falling into disrepair (but not to enforce keeping the building in good repair.) Failure to comply with a repair order was an offence under the Act and fines or imprisonment might result.

Alterations to registered buildings were controlled through a permit-issuing procedure. This involved the determination of permit applications for alteration, removal or demolition of buildings either on the Register or subject to Interim Preservation Order control. (This was a determination of the Historic Buildings Council not the Minister or the Governor in Council.)

Financial assistance to owners of registered buildings could be granted in the form of loans and grants. With the consent of the Treasurer tax on land which contained a registered building might also be remitted or deferred.

The Historic Buildings Council made recommendations to the Minister and responsible authorities under the Planning and Environment Act 1987 on matters relating to heritage conservation.

The Council also undertook a broad public education role in the conservation of Victoria's built heritage. 

Changes from 1995

In 1995 the Heritage Act (No 93/1995) was passed with the goal of providing a consolidated legislative framework for the protection and conservation of places and objects of cultural heritage significance and the registration of such places and objects.  This Act was to replace both the Historic Buildings Act 1981 and the Historic Shipwrecks Act 1981.

The Historic Buildings Council was to be replaced by the 16  member Heritage Council appointed by the Governor in Council on the advice of the Minister.  These members were to be people with an interest and expertise in conservation rather than representatives of organisations.  The exception was to be the National Trust of Australia (Victoria) which might submit a panel of three names for the Minister to choose one nomination.

The roles of the Heritage Council were summarised as being to facilitate simplified listing and approval processes for the Heritage Register which incorporate links to local planning schemes and to provide incentives and assistance for quality heritage conservation.  Powers granted to the Council were comparable to those existing in prior legislation.  The Council was to decide upon applications for listing of a building on the Heritage Register.  Applications may be referred to local government or the responsible Minister for inclusion in local planning schemes.  Objections to registration are also to be heard by the Heritage Council.

The Executive Director of the Heritage Council, appointed under the Public Service Management Act, is to establish and maintain the Heritage Register, make recommendations to the Council regarding applications for inclusion in or removal from the Register, to regulate the investigation and documentation of registered places and to determine applications for permits and consents under the Act.  The Minister retained the right to have recommendations referred for determination by the Minister.

The Executive Director was to refer matters pertaining to permits to the Council for determination within certain classes determined by the Council.  Appeals from decisions relating to permits and orders could be referred to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (from 1998 the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal).  Repair orders are issued under the authority of the Minister.

The Heritage Fund was established to assit owners with maintenance and restoration works.  This fund was to replace the former Historic Buildings Fund.

Related Functions

Government buildings on the Government Buildings Register
Government owned buildings which were still used for government purposes and which were not on a crown land reserve (ie. are situated on government land) could also be protected under the Government Buildings Advisory Council Act 1972. The amending Act of 1981 established the Government Buildings Register [see buildings, government (preservation of)].

Historic buildings and sites on crown land
"Historic sites or places" denotes areas (such as goldfields) or historic buildings once ly owned or government owned but no longer used for government purposes, which are on public crown land (usually reserved) [see crown lands (historic sites)].

Buildings within heritage areas
ly owned buildings can also be protected through statutory planning controls which designate certain areas as being of urban conservation or historic interest. Advisory services and financial assistance is given to encourage conservation and restoration projects with particular emphasis on the conservation of historic areas [see heritage protection].

Protection of cultural and natural heritage
National Estate funding is used to assist projects under these and many other types of conservation and preservation programmes which seek to protect Australia's cultural and natural heritage [see national estate].</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Hairdressers Registration Board was a statutory authority responsible for the registration and training of hairdressers and the regulation of hairdressing premises and schools.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Establishment of the Hairdressers Registration Board&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Board was established in 1937 under the provisions of the Hairdressers Registration Act 1936 (No.4396).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;According to M.V. Anderson, the first Registrar of the Board, the original Act was introduced as a  Members Bill and was modelled on the provisions of the Medical Act which governed the registration of dentists.  It had been initially sponsored by the Master Ladies Hairdressers and Cosmeticians Association of Victoria, but the Minister of Health insisted that the legislation also cover the registration of Men's Hairdressers and Schools.  Debate emphasised the danger to the public from unskilled work.  The  schools of hairdressing had been established because there was a shortage of applicants for apprenticeships, the traditional means of training hairdressers.  &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Board consisted of representatives of the industry and government authorities and from 1975 consisted of ten persons appointed by the Governor in Council.  The ten were a chairman who had no pecuniary interest in the industry, a nominee of the Minister of Education, a representative from the registered schools, a representative from the Industrial Training Commission and two representatives from each of the Master Ladies Hairdressers, the Master Hairdressers and the Employees Federation.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Board was virtually autonomous since it raised its own revenue through the charging of annual registration fees and the receipt of fines and legal costs paid by defendants who were prosecuted for breaches of the regulations.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Functions of the Board&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Under the provisions of sections (7) and (8) of the Hairdressers Registration Act, the Board was required to maintain a register of hairdressers and to approve and register schools of hairdressing, other than those controlled by the Education Department.  Section (11) of the Act prohibited non-registered persons from calling themselves hairdressers and from practising the trade.  Applicants were registered in particular classes of hairdressing and were only permitted to practise in classes for which they were registered.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Board made regulations regarding standards of hygiene, sanitation and safety in the conduct of premises and schools and standards of training and qualifications of teachers.  The health and safety regulations were not to be in contravention of the Health Act and in 1980 the Health Commission assumed all responsibility for standards of hygiene in premises, while the Board retained jurisdiction over schools.  The Board conducted examinations for students from registered schools of hairdressing and, when necessary, for applicants from overseas.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Under section (14) of the Act the Board had the power to conduct investigations under sections 14-16 of the Evidence Act 1958 and under section (17) the Board could authorise inspectors to prosecute persons in breach of the regulations.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Abolition of the Board&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;An Inquiry into Labour Market Impacts of Alternative Training Arrangements for the Victorian Hairdressing and Beauty Industries was conducted by Coopers and Lybrand Services - Management Consultants in 1984-5 and arising from the recommendations of the Inquiry, the Hairdressers Registration Act was repealed on 1 January 1986 and thus the Board was abolished.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The major impact of the repeal of the Hairdressers Registration Act, other than the abolition of the Board, was the change from a system of registration to one of accreditation.  Hairdressers had previously been required to apply for registration annually, but with the repeal of the Act, a Tradesman's Certificate or Certificate of Proficiency was issued to qualified applicants on the completion of their training.  It became the function of the Industrial Training Commission to inspect and accredit  schools of hairdressing for approval under the Industrial Training Act and to examine students for the Tradesman's Certificate or Certificate of Proficiency.  The Education Department Colleges of Hairdressing were also affected by the repeal of the Act in so far as their graduates received the Tradesman's Certificate or Certificate of Proficiency and were thus no longer required to seek annual registration.  The Education Department Colleges were not responsible to the Industrial Training Commission for examination or accreditation.  The staff of the Hairdressing Registration Board were transferred to the Department of Employment and Industrial Affairs.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background

Since the first occupation of the Port Phillip District the Government of Victoria has been responsible for the management of the publicly-owned land and water of the State. As at 1988 approximately two-thirds of the States land had been alienated from the Crown. The Government also plays a role in the protection of this ly-owned land and water. The management of Crown (unalienated) land and protection of ly-owned (alienated) land has had a complex history and is encompassed by a number of related functions.

In the 19th century, Crown land administration included the survey of land, regulation of the sale (alienation) of Crown land by auction and selection;  settlement of disputes regarding alienation and occupation;  issue of occupation licences and leases and ensuring compliance with the conditions of such licences and leases;  issue of Deeds of Grant for alienated land and for reserves granted for public purposes such as schools and churches;  issue of licences for pastoral occupation and determination of rents;  control and management of public parks, reserves and commons, alpine resorts and prevention of the unauthorised use or occupation of crown lands.

In the 20th century the focus of land administration has been the management of the State's public land through the issue of leases and licences for unreserved land;  the support, co-ordination and monitoring of committees of management responsible for over 4000 Crown reserves;  the control of pests and weeds and development of conservation and management plans for public land. 

In order to gain some understanding of the various ways that the States land has been managed and regulated it is useful to understand some of the ways in which land has been classified.

Overview of land classification and management

The land and waters of Victoria have, since their first occupation, been classified in various ways and have often been managed according to their classification. The primary classifications are:

Alienated/Unalienated

Under presumption of the legal doctrine of "terra nullus" the land and waters of Australia were seized in 1770 from the indigenous population and annexed to and vested in the Crown of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. From the time of the annexation property rights could be derived only from the Crown. The administration of these rights in the Port Phillip District was initially through the Crown Colony of New South Wales. Since 1851 the land and waters of Victoria have been administered by the Crown Colony of Victoria and its successors. As land was sold to  interests it became known as alienated land.

Reserved/Unreserved

Under legislation Crown (unalienated) land and water can be reserved permanently or temporarily for a variety of purposes. The permanent reservation of land can only be revoked by Act of Parliament. Remaining Crown land is unreserved.

There are a number of special forms of reservation which have determined the way the land and/or water is managed. These include:
State Forests:The Forests Act 1907 provided for the creation of permanent or reserved forest which can be excised only by Act of Parliament, by a resolution of Parliament, for specific public purposes or by exchange for  or unoccupied Crown land. The Forests Commission is vested with sole control and management of all areas of reserved forest.
National Parks: The National Parks Act 1956 (No.6023) provided for the establishment of national parks under the control of the National Parks Authority. Under the National Parks Act 1975 the types of parks and reserves managed as national parks were expanded to include wilderness parks and state parks.

Public/Government

Since 1987 the management of Crown lands has been separated according to whether the land is classified as public land or as Government land. Public land has been identified as that land which needs to be retained permanently for the "public benefit" because of its natural resource, environmental resource or heritage attributes, and includes:
unreserved public land (including forests and plantations)
native forest reserves
public parks, gardens and recreation reserves
national and state parks, historic sites
wildlife and wilderness reserves.
Government land has been identified as land used for the provision of goods and services by public agencies, and includes:
declared roadways (used)
railway permanent way and rail reserves
sites of premises and other land use for delivery of goods and services, eg. offices, schools, laboratories, depots etc.
Unreserved lands subject to classification review are managed as Public land until their classification into Government or Public land.

A Bill of Parliament to authorise the transfer of Government land management, lease and sale functions to the Minister for Property and Services (VRG 69) was prepared but never tabled. In order to effect the intention of the Bill, sections of the Land Act 1958 (No.6284) were subsequently transferred to the Minister for Property and Services via Administrative Arrangements Order (No. 58) 1988. This transfer of functions has been described as "administratively clumsy". 

The authority to manage and undertake the lease and sale of government land was transferred to the Minister of Property and Services to enable a co-ordinated assets sales program. Although the power to sell Crown land was transferred to Property and Services (VRG 69), the ability to lease designated government land (usually in the metropolitan area) had to be effected by the Department of Property and Services (VA 430) acting as an agent for the Department of Conservation, Forests and Lands (VA 1034). Similarly the Department of Conservation, Forests and Lands exercised responsibility for the sale of Crown land (usually in rural areas) by acting as a land agent for the Department of Property and Services.

Public Crown lands

Although the distinction between public and government land is relatively recent, for the purposes of functional analysis the distinction has been applied retrospectively.

This function, ie. the management of Crown land classified as public land, has included the following broad activities:
regulation of occupation and use of unreserved land by lease and licence
reservation of land for public purposes
regulation of the management of reserved land.

Unreserved land subject to classification review is managed as public land until it is classified.

Regulation of occupation and use of unreserved land

The first Act to restrain the unauthorised occupation of Crown Lands (commonly known as the Squatting Act) was passed on 29 July 1836 authorising the issue of depasturing licences for grazing stock on vacant Crown land outside the limits of settlement. The Act imposed penalties for the illegal occupation of land. The first squatters licences were not granted however until July 1838 when the first full-time Commissioner of Crown Lands was appointed.

The regulation of occupation and use of unreserved Crown land has since been governed either by short term (annually renewable) tenure or guaranteed long term tenure, neither of which embodied the right to purchase. Authorised forms of occupation have included land held under lease, licence or permit within the following categories: primary production, residential, recreational, public utility, industrial and commercial. Examples of temporary occupancies have included grazing licences, permits to remove gravel and bee range licences. Examples of long term occupancies have included Mallee grazing leases and industrial leases.

Crown land occupation has been controlled and administered pursuant to a number of Acts, including the Squatting Act mentioned above. Until the establishment of the Department of Crown Lands and Survey (VA 538) in 1857, primary responsibility for policing the occupation of Crown lands rested with the various district Commissioners of Crown Lands. From 1853 to 1857 the district Commissioners were organised into a Department of Crown Lands (VA 2878) under the supervision of a Chief Commissioner of Crown Lands.



Pastoral Leases

After 1829, as white settlement in New South Wales (and the Port Phillip District) grew, the emphasis of land administration shifted from small-scale land grants encouraging agricultural production, to tickets of occupancy, later to become the pastoral licence and leases of the 1830's and 1840's. In the years from first European settlement in the Port Phillip District in the early 1830s, the fertile regions of Victoria had been turned into sheep runs by squatters whose possession of the land rested on simple occupancy. By 1838 practically the whole of the present Western District had been occupied and flocks numbered more than 310,000. By 1840 this number had almost doubled. [Australian Encyclopaedia, Grollier, Sydney, n.d, Volume IX, p.118]

After 1838 the occupiers of these pastoral runs in the Port Phillip District had to obtain an annual 10 licence based on a stock assessment which was conducted by the Commissioners of Crown Lands. Under the provisions of 1847 Orders in Council all persons in occupation of licensed runs had to lodge applications for leases and the pre-emptive rights of the squatters were thus recognised. In the newly defined Intermediate and Unsettled Districts of New South Wales, which encompassed most of the Port Phillip District except land near the townships of Melbourne and Geelong, pastoral occupants were to be granted eight and fourteen year leases respectively, together with the right of prior purchase and compensation for improvements.

The leases were never granted. Instead 1852 Orders in Council continued the system of yearly tenure. The 1862 Land Act allowed a nine year tenure which was to expire in 1870. Under the terms of the 1869 Land Act the annual licences were not assured beyond 1880. The annual licences constituted a chattel interest and were transferable, but after 1873 no new licences were issued - all new runs and old surrendered runs were held under "grazing licences". Pre-emptive rights to homestead sections were secured to all licensed tenants, but after 1870 no claims were allowed for compensation for improvements made by outgoing licensees. Until 1852 rents were based on the amount of stock actually carried. Later, the basis for assessment was the grazing capacity of the run. This was calculated from estimates sent in by the run holders and verified or amended following occasional inspection and arbitration.

Reservation of land for public purposes

The disposal (sale, reservation or otherwise) of Crown lands in the Australian Colonies was initially regulated by Imperial legislation. An 1842 Act (5 &amp; 6 Victoria, c. 36) provided for Her Majesty, or persons acting on her behalf, to reserve or dispose of in some other manner

such lands as may be required for public roads or other internal communications, whether by land or water, or for the use or benefit of the aboriginal inhabitants of the country, or for purposes of military defence, or as sites of places of public worship, schools or other public buildings, or as places for the interment of the dead, or places for the recreation and amusement of the inhabitants of any town or village, or as the sites of public quays or landing places on the sea coast or shores of navigable streams, or for any other purpose of public safety, convenience, health or enjoyment....

Crown lands reserved, temporarily or permanently for public purposes are known as Crown Reserves. Some are surveyed allotments while others are large tracts of land whose boundaries are loosely defined. A permanent reserve can only be revoked by an Act of Parliament.

Until 1988 all Crown reserves were managed by the one department. The division of ... truncated</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Since the first occupation of the Port Phillip District the Government of Victoria has been responsible for the management of the publicly-owned land and water of the State. As at 1988 approximately two-thirds of the States land had been alienated from the Crown. The Government also plays a role in the protection of ly-owned land and water. The management of Crown (unalienated) land and protection of ly-owned (alienated) land has had a complex history and is encompassed by a number of related functions.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In the 19th century, Crown land administration included the survey of land, regulation of the sale (alienation) of Crown land by auction and selection;  settlement of disputes regarding alienation and occupation;  issue of occupation licences and leases and ensuring compliance with the conditions of such licences and leases;  issue of Deeds of Grant for alienated land and for reserves granted for public purposes such as schools and churches;  issue of licences for pastoral occupation and determination of rents;  control and management of public parks, reserves and commons, alpine resorts and prevention of the unauthorised use or occupation of crown lands.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In the 20th century the focus of land administration has been the management of the State's public land through the issue of leases and licences for unreserved land;  the support, co-ordination and monitoring of committees of management responsible for over 4000 Crown reserves;  the control of pests and weeds and development of conservation and management plans for public land. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In order to gain some understanding of the various ways that the States land has been managed and regulated it is useful to understand some of the ways in which land has been classified.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Overview of land classification and management&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The land and waters of Victoria have, since their first occupation, been classified in various ways and have often been managed according to their classification. The primary classifications are:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Alienated/Unalienated&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Under presumption of the legal doctrine of "terra nullis" the land and waters of Australia were seized in 1770 from the indigenous population and annexed to and vested in the Crown of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. From the time of the annexation property rights could be derived only from the Crown. The administration of these rights in the Port Phillip District was initially through the Crown Colony of New South Wales. Since 1851 the land and waters of Victoria have been administered by the Crown Colony of Victoria and its successors. As land was sold to  interests it became known as alienated land.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Reserved/Unreserved&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Under legislation Crown (unalienated) land and water can be reserved permanently or temporarily for a variety of purposes. The permanent reservation of land can only be revoked by Act of Parliament. Remaining Crown land is unreserved.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;There are a number of special forms of reservation which have determined the way the land and/or water is managed. These include:&lt;BR /&gt;State Forests:The Forests Act 1907 provided for the creation of permanent or reserved forest which can be excised only by Act of Parliament, by a resolution of Parliament, for specific public purposes or by exchange for  or unoccupied Crown land. The Forests Commission is vested with sole control and management of all areas of reserved forest.&lt;BR /&gt;National Parks: The National Parks Act 1956 (No.6023) provided for the establishment of national parks under the control of the National Parks Authority. Under the National Parks Act 1975 the types of parks and reserves managed as national parks were expanded to include wilderness parks and state parks.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Public/Government&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Since 1987 the management of Crown lands has been separated according to whether the land is classified as public land or as government land. Public land has been identified as that land which needs to be retained permanently for the "public benefit" because of its natural resource, environmental resource or heritage attributes, and includes:&lt;BR /&gt;unreserved public land (including forests and plantations)&lt;BR /&gt;native forest reserves&lt;BR /&gt;public parks, gardens and recreation reserves&lt;BR /&gt;national and state parks and historic sites&lt;BR /&gt;wildlife and wilderness reserves.&lt;BR /&gt;Government land has been identified as land used for the provision of goods and services by public agencies, and includes:&lt;BR /&gt;declared roadways (used)&lt;BR /&gt;railway permanent way and rail reserves&lt;BR /&gt;sites of premises and other land use for delivery of goods and services, eg. offices, schools, laboratories, depots etc.&lt;BR /&gt;Unreserved lands subject to classification review are managed as public land until their classification into government or public land.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;A Bill of Parliament to authorise the transfer of government land management, lease and sale functions to the Minister for Property and Services (VRG 69) was prepared but never tabled. In order to effect the intention of the Bill, sections of the Land Act 1958 (No.6284) were subsequently transferred to the Minister for Property and Services via Administrative Arrangements Order (No. 58) 1988. This transfer of functions has been described as "administratively clumsy". &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The authority to manage and undertake the lease and sale of government land was transferred to the Minister of Property and Services to enable a co-ordinated assets sales program. Although the power to sell Crown land was transferred to Property and Services (VRG 69), the ability to lease designated government land (usually in the metropolitan area) had to be effected by the Department of Property and Services (VA 430) acting as an agent for the Department of Conservation, Forests and Lands (VA 1034). Similarly the Department of Conservation, Forests and Lands exercised responsibility for the sale of Crown land (usually in rural areas) by acting as a land agent for the Department of Property and Services.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Government lands&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Although the distinction between public and government land is relatively recent, for the purposes of functional analysis the distinction has been applied retrospectively.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;This function, ie. the management of land classified as government land, has included the following broad activities:&lt;BR /&gt;sale and selection (alienation) of Crown land&lt;BR /&gt;reservation of land for Government purposes&lt;BR /&gt;management of reserved Government land as an asset&lt;BR /&gt;Government lease of ly-owned land.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Land sales by auction and selection&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Following the annexation of Australia in 1770 all titles to land in the Colonies had to emanate from the Crown of the United Kingdom of England and Ireland. Sale of the land by auction first commenced in New South Wales in 1831. In the Port Phillip District the first town land was sold on 1 June 1837 and the first country land was sold on 12 September 1838. Until the Nicholson Act of 1860 the principal medium of alienation was by Crown Grant or grant in fee simple (ie.freehold).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;After the gold boom of the 1850's and the resultant increase in immigration and population, the Victorian legislature made provision for the selection of small scale land holdings, a practice referred to colloquially as the "opening up" or the "unlocking" of the land. The intention was to take back the vast tracts of land the pastoralists held under licence and give the greatest possible encouragement to the genuine settler to select a block of land and establish a farm that would support a family. The year 1861 saw the introduction of the conditional purchase of Crown land, a new form of statutory tenure which enabled selectors to take up land on terms of deferred payment, leading ultimately to the grant of estate in fee simple. There were many forms of conditional purchase. Between 1860 and 1884, five successive Acts enlarged and accelerated the "selection" of land for small scale settlement.&lt;BR /&gt;In summary, conditional purchase of land by selection after 1869 consisted of a three-stage process: application for a licence;  application for a lease;  application for a Crown Grant.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Reservation of land for Government purposes&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The disposal (sale, reservation or otherwise) of Crown lands in the Australian Colonies was initially regulated by Imperial legislation. An 1842 Act (5 &amp; 6 Victoria, c. 36) provided for Her Majesty, or persons acting on her behalf, to reserve or dispose of in some other manner&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;such lands as may be required for public roads or other internal communications, whether by land or water, or for the use or benefit of the aboriginal inhabitants of the country, or for purposes of military defence, or as sites of places of public worship, schools or other public buildings, or as places for the interment of the dead, or places for the recreation and amusement of the inhabitants of any town or village, or as the sites of public quays or landing places on the sea coast or shores of navigable streams, or for any other purpose of public safety, convenience, health or enjoyment....&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Crown lands reserved temporarily or permanently for public purposes are known as Crown Reserves. Some are surveyed allotments while others are large tracts of land whose boundaries are loosely defined. A permanent reserve can only be revoked by an Act of Parliament.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Until 1988 all Crown reserves were managed by the one department. The division of responsibility for Crown lands in 1988 introduced a distinction between Crown reserves for public purposes and Crown reserves for government purposes. Examples of Crown reserves for government purposes are: declared roadways (used);  railway permanent way and rail reserves;  sites of public schools, public hospitals and prisons;  sites of other public buildings and ports and harbours.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Further research is required into the administration of Crown reserves between 1853 when the Colonial Secretarys Office ceased to have prime responsibility and 1857 when responsibility was assumed by the Department of Crown Lands and Survey. It is believed that the Surveyor-Generals Department (VA 2921) was primarily responsible during this time although it is not yet certain what relationship existed, and how Crown lands responsibilities were divided, between the Surveyor-Generals Department and the Department of Crown Lands (VA 2878).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Management of Government land as an asset&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Although the 1987 Lands Bill intended to authorise the reclassification of Crown land into public land and government land was never tabled in Parliament, a Government Land Bureau was established in 1987-88 within the Department of Property and Services. The Bureau had responsibility for managing all Crown land classified as government land. An inter-departmental Land Classification Review Committee was established to undertake the classification of land as public or government.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The reclassification of land was introduced to support a co-ordinated Asset Management program which would encompass both the management of leased or licensed government land in the metropolitan area as well as asset sales or improvement.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Government lease of  land&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;An Accommodation Branch was established in 1988 within the Department of Property and Services to co-ordinate advice and recommendations to an inter-departmental Accommodation Task Force which in turn was established to support a Government Accommodation Committee of Cabinet. The Accommodation Branch had a role in the leasing of ly-owned land for Government use.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

The Centre consisted of six bureaux, each designed to provide service and advice to members of the community. As a result of a rationalisation program conducted within the Department of the Premier (VA 2717), the Centre ceased to exist, as such, and in November 1981 the Government Information Bureau, retitled the Victorian Government Information Centre, was transferred to the Department of Property and Services (VA 430).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Community Services Centre comprised a Migrant Advisory Bureau, an Anti-Discrimination Bureau, a Government Information Office and bookshop and a Women's Advisory Office.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Information Victoria was established in late 1986 and comprises a telephone and counter information and referral service;  a clearinghouse of government literature;  the government bookshop and a specialist outlet for Victoria titles. In addition the Information Victoria Centre housed the Public Record Office Search Room for some years, the government Mapshop, Health Sharing Women and City Occasional Child Care and these services were included in all marketing and public activity. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Information Victoria also has a role in the development of policy on government information and the development of operational systems and guidelines.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Department of Property and Services (VA 430) was abolished in January 1991 and Information Victoria was transferred to the Ministry of Ethnic, Municipal and Community Affairs (VA 3015).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In October 1992 machinery of government changes resulted in the transfer of Information Victoria to the Department of Finance (VA 3016).

       <description type="full">This function is concerned with the provision and administration of all forms of post-secondary education not provided by a University or Technical and Further Education (TAFE) provider. Providers of this type of education included colleges of advanced education and institutes of technology.

The provision of post-secondary education in Victoria was originally the responsibility of the Education Department (VA 714). Prior to 1965, institutions offering non-university tertiary education in Victoria were either administered and staffed directly by the Education Department, or were controlled by their own Council, employed their own staff and awarded their own degrees.

In 1965, the Victoria Institute of Colleges was established with the responsibility for controlling non-university tertiary education in Victoria. Affiliation of the Institute was by application to or invitation from the Institute. The Institute was governed by a Council; Members represented Parliament, the tertiary sector in general, the Department of Education, the academic staff of the affiliated colleges, the Victorian universities, commerce and industry, the principals of the affiliated colleges, graduates of the Institute, students of the affiliated colleges and the State College Victoria. The functions of the Institute were to coordinate and accredit tertiary education providers in Victoria (other than universities), establish new tertiary education providers (other than universities) and maintain links and support across all tertiary education providers in Victoria (other than universities). The Institute reported directly to the Minister for Education. 

In 1978, under the provisions of the Post Secondary Education Act 1978, the Institute no longer reported directly to the Governor in Council or the Minister for Education but to the newly formed Victorian Post-Secondary Education Commission (VA 721). The Institute was formally abolished in 1980 and was succeeded by the Post-Secondary Education Commission (VPSEC) under the provisions of the Post Secondary Education (Amendment) Act 1980. VPSEC gained responsibility for all functions undertaken by the Victoria Institute of Colleges and its primary functions were to provide advice to the Minister for Education on all matters relating to higher education; recommend the establishment of new post secondary education institutions and assess courses for accreditation, reaccreditation, and the making of awards. 

Research note:
The consolidation of all boards with responsibility for vocational education and training into the State Training Board in 1987 meant that all types of education and training were now the responsibility of the Ministry of Education and Training (VA 1112), rather than being split between the Ministry and the Department of Labour (VA 2777). This change in function is reflected in the change in function title in the PROV system. Researchers interested in records prior to 1987 should see this function and associated functions and agencies (particularly VF 315 education (technical/vocational) to c. 1987; and VF 319 education (university) to c. 1987). These functions were consolidated to form VF 318 education (tertiary) post c. 1987, which includes all forms of tertiary education and training post-1987.</description>

       <description type="full">This function is concerned with the provision of technical and vocational education to c. 1987. This includes education and training conducted through Technical and Further Education (TAFE) providers (including education done as part of an apprenticeship), Colleges of Advanced Education and Institutes of Technology. For apprenticeships and other forms of on-the-job training, see VF 121 Industrial and apprenticeship training.

Technical and vocational education is concerned with the provision of education that is practical or vocational in nature, and results in a degree or certificate which allows a certain level of work in a particular industry. Technical and vocational courses often have a practical component or work placement; however, these are different than the formal system of apprenticeships required in some industries. Apprentices are often required to take classes as part of their apprenticeships; this function includes these classes, but not the apprenticeship itself.

Technical education began with the establishment of Schools of Mines and industries and Mechanics Institutes in the 19th century. The first technical institutes were the Schools of Mines established in the 1870s at Ballarat, Bendigo and the Working Men's College (later Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology) established in 1887. 

Senior technical colleges traditionally offered trade technician certificate and diploma courses in a wide range of technical and scientific fields, including apprenticeship trades, architecture, art, building, commerce, management, public administration and the various branches of engineering and metallurgy, pure and applied science.

Post secondary, technical and vocational education, and adult and community education programs continued to be provided through technical schools, Education Department technical colleges and the technical colleges associated with some of the colleges of advanced education. From 1973, this sector of education became known as TAFE or Technical and Further Education. 

In 1980, the Technical and Further Education Board (VA 1176) was established. It was responsible for the administration, accreditation and distribution of funding to TAFEs in Victoria. 

Establishment of the State Training Board

In 1987, the Government consolidated the boards responsible for training in Victoria by abolishing the previous boards, the Industrial Training Commission (responsible for apprenticeships; VA 900) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) Board (responsible for TAFE education; VA 1176). By an Order in Council under the provisions of the Post-Secondary Education Act 1978, the State Training Board (VA 3002) was established. Its main functions were to co-ordinate and administer the Government's training policies and administer the technical and vocational training services provided by the state and public authorities. The order took effect from 30 November 1987; however, it was not until 1 March 1991 and the proclamation of the Vocational Education and Training Act 1990 (No. 45/1990) that the previous boards (TAFE Board and Industrial Training Commission) were formally abolished.

Research note:
The consolidation of all boards with responsibility for vocational education and training into the State Training Board in 1987 meant that all types of education and training were now the responsibility of the Ministry of Education and Training (VA 1112), rather than being split between the Ministry and the Department of Labour (VA 2777). This change in function is reflected in the change in function title in the PROV system. Researchers interested in records prior to 1987 should see this function and associated functions and agencies (particularly VF 314 education (post-secondary) to c. 1987; and VF 319 education (university) to c. 1987). These functions were consolidated to form VF 318 education (tertiary) post c. 1987, which includes all forms of tertiary education and training post-1987.</description>

       <description type="full">Adult education relates to the provision of any type of education delivered to adults through course providers registered as Adult Community Education (ACE) organisations. ACE organisations receive funding and accreditation through the Adult, Community and Further Education Board (ACFEB; VA 4280). Types of ACE organisations include agencies such as the CAE (VA 1195), some Universities and TAFEs and community organisations such as neighbourhood houses, community centres or learning centres.

The provision of adult education began with the Workers' Education Association and other related informal adult education providers, such as the University Extension program. The CAE (then Council for Adult Education) was established in 1946 with the purpose of delivering education to adults in the community. At its establishment, the CAE was primarily concerned with cultural and general education in metropolitan and rural areas. However, the CAE soon introduced specialist classes, including programs for the handicapped and education for prison inmates. During the 1960s, the CAE began running classes which were semi-vocational in nature, and in 1969, began conducting HSC classes. In 1974, programs in basic education and adult literacy were run for the first time.

Another important provider of adult education is AMES (Adult Multicultural Education Services) which was established in 1951 as Adult Migrant English Services. It provides services, education and training to immigrants and people of non-English speaking backgrounds, including English language classes, employment skills classes, settlement services and translation services.

In 1991, the Adult, Community and Further Education Act 1991 (Act No. 91/1991) established an Adult, Community and Further Education Board (VA 4280) which became responsible for allocating Government funding to all Adult Education Institutions. Additionally, the Act prescribed the establishment of Regional Boards to allow administration and maintenance of all accredited adult education organisations within a particular area.

Adult education includes the provision of both accredited and non-accredited courses. Accredited courses are those such as the teaching of VCE to adults or preparatory courses for entry into University or TAFE. Non-accredited courses include short courses taken for pleasure or to improve a particular skill, such as English as a Second Language (ESL) or IT classes.</description>

       <description type="full">This function encompasses all forms of tertiary education, including all university, technical and vocational education and training and apprenticeships which result in the conferring of an accredited degree at certificate level and up. This includes courses provided by Universities, TAFEs, Institutes of Technology and Colleges of Advanced Education. Please note this function is concerned with the administration and policies surrounding tertiary education; for individual agencies, see VF 382 Educational Institutions.

Tertiary education prior to 1987
Prior to 1987, responsibility for tertiary education and training was split between a number of different sectors, including the Ministry of Education and Training (VA 1112; responsible for administration of university, technical and vocational education) and the Department of Labour (VA 2777; responsible for apprenticeships and industrial training). In 1987, the statutory bodies responsible for accreditation of apprenticeships (Industrial Training Commission; VA 900) and TAFEs (TAFE Education Board; VA 1176) were abolished and replaced with one body, the State Training Board (VA 3002). This consolidation reflected a larger change in the conception of tertiary education and training in Victoria. 

The primary statutory authority associated with tertiary education was the State Training Board (VA 3002), which was responsible for co-ordination and administration of the Government's training policies and administration of the technical and vocational training services provided by the state and public authorities.

Administration of university education was primarily done by the governing councils of individual universities and by the State Government, with the Commonwealth Government providing the funding for universities.</description>

       <description type="full">This function encompasses the provision of university education to 1987. It is concerned with policies, accreditation and funding of universities, not university agencies themselves. For individual agencies, see VF 382 Educational institutions. 

University education began in Victoria in 1853 with the establishment of the University of Melbourne. It remained the only university in Victoria until 1958, when Monash University was established. From the outset, university education in Victoria was conducted along British lines, and resulted in students gaining a Bachelor's level degree and higher. While university education was slow to take off in Victoria, enrolments surged after World War II, when the Commonwealth Government paid for places for ex-servicemen. Student numbers continued to grow in the 1960s, and, in 1967, La Trobe University was founded. Deakin University was then established in 1974.

From 1958 until 1974, funding for universities was done through a combination of Commonwealth and State Government funds, student fees and investments and other sources. In 1974, the Whitlam Government assumed full funding responsibilities for all Australian universities, abolished all student fees and made commitments on universal access to tertiary education for qualified students. This change meant that the Commonwealth Government was responsible for funding of the universities, but legislative responsibilities remained with the states and the governing councils of the individual universities.

This system remained in place until the mid-1980s, when it was determined that the university sector was under stress and under funded. This led to a complete restructure of the university sector in 1988, the reintroduction of student fees and the establishment of several former Colleges of Advanced Education as universities.

The functional responsibility for university education remained with the State Governments, with the Commonwealth Government responsible for funding only. This meant that higher education issues and policies such as those associated with accreditation, policy development, maintenance and administration were conducted through State statutory bodies or the governing councils of the universities, rather than through the Commonwealth Government.

Research note:
The consolidation of all boards with responsibility for vocational education and training into the State Training Board in 1987 meant that all types of education and training were now the responsibility of the Ministry of Education and Training (VA 1112), rather than being split between the Ministry and the Department of Labour (VA 2777). This change in function is reflected in the change in function title in the PROV system. Researchers interested in records prior to 1987 should see this function and associated functions and agencies (particularly VF 314 education (post-secondary) to c. 1987; and VF 315 education (technical/vocational) to c. 1987). These functions were consolidated to form VF 318 education (tertiary) post c. 1987, which includes all forms of tertiary education and training post-1987.</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Archaeological and Aboriginal Relics Preservation Act 1972 provides for the preservation of archaeological and aboriginal relics. It enables the Governor-in-Council to declare land to be an archaeological area for the preservation of relics therein, establishes an Archaeological Relics Advisory Committee to advise the Minister on all matters it thinks necessary in relation to archaeological relics and the preservation of those relics and makes the buying and selling of relics or the possession or display of Aboriginal skeletal remains to be an offence in certain circumstances.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Minister for Planning and Environment (VRG 65) had responsibility for state archaeological functions from 1983 until 1990. Developmental work in the area of aboriginal archaeology was funded through the grants process administered by the Aboriginal Affairs Unit during this time. Particular emphasis was placed on involving and training Aborigines in the work of the Victoria Archaeological Survey. Cultural Awareness officers within Aboriginal Co-operatives throughout the State were trained and funded, as was the Regional Site Officer scheme for training Aborigines in archaeological investigation and analysis, cultural resource management and community liaison.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Two committees were established in 1985 to advise whether Aboriginal skeletal remains should be preserved for scientific value or be reburied. They were the Aboriginal Affairs Committee which advised the Museum of Victoria Council on material in state collections and the Skeletal sub-committee of the Aboriginal Relics  Advisory Committee which advised the Secretary for Planning and Environment on the holding and disposition of skeletal remains. In 1988-89 16 skeletal remains were returned to local aboriginal communities and relevant interstate authorities.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Commonwealth Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1987 provides Commonwealth protection for significant Aboriginal areas and objects where existing State laws do not provide effective protection and enables the Commonwealth Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to make declarations in respect to those areas and objects after consultation with the relevant State Minister.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;From April to May 1990 the newly commissioned Minister for Aboriginal Affairs had responsibility for state archaeological functions. Responsibility for these functions was then transferred to the Minister for Conservation and Environment (VRG 94) until February 1992 when it was transferred back to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs where it currently remains.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Until 1993 all State archaeological functions were administered together. In 1993 the administration of the aboriginal archaeological function was separated from the administration of maritime and historic (post-European settlement) archaeology (see archaeology survey (maritime and historic)).

ly owned buildings which are of "historic" or "architectural significance" could be protected and assistance given for their upkeep under the Historic Buildings Act. [See Buildings, historic (protection of)].

Government owned buildings of "historic" or "architectural significance" which were still used for government purposes and which were not on a crown land reserve (ie. are situated on government land) could, from 1989, be protected under the same legislation [See Buildings, historic (protection of)], or could be protected under the Government Buildings Advisory Council Act 1972. [See Buildings, government (preservation of)].

"Historic sites or places" denotes areas (such as goldfields) or historic buildings once ly owned or government owned but no longer used for government purposes, which are on public crown land (usually reserved). [See Crown Lands (historic sites)].

ly owned buildings can also be protected through statutory planning controls which designate certain areas as being of urban conservation or historic interest. Advisory services and financial assistance is given to encourage conservation and restoration projects with particular emphasis on the conservation of historic areas. [See Heritage Protection].

National Estate funding is used to assist projects under these and many other types of conservation and preservation programmes which seek to protect Australia's cultural and natural heritage. [See National Estate].

       <description type="full">Background

Responsibility for the development of environmental policy appears to have originated in the Ministry of Conservation (VA 551) in 1973. During the 1980s this function was administered closely with the strategic planning function. In April 1990 responsibility for this function was transferred to the Department of Conservation and Environment (VA 3004). This function should not be confused with the environment protection (regulation) function administered by the Environment Protection Authority (VA 1058). Over time the function has encompassed:

environmental policy which involves; 

	developing and implementing strategies for safeguarding the environment including the State Conservation Strategy 1986, which gained statutory force through the Planning and Environment Act 1987;  State Greenhouse Strategy

	investigating specific environmental issues, Victorian Biodiversity Strategy, Biophysical Data, rural land use and environmental planning, Wetlands program, Native vegetation retention policy, policies and programs aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, monitoring climate change indicators, Environmental Choice education and labelling program

	allocation of funds to groups concerned with environmental issues, community education and participation in environmental issues and programs

	monitoring and reporting on the state of the environment;  preparation of State            of the Environment Reports and the work of the Commissioner for the            Environment 1986-?1992

environmental planning which involves; 

	facilitating environmental project evaluation and advising government agencies and industry on environmental matters.

	ensuring environmental input in land use planning, advice on the environmental effects of planning scheme amendments and permits;  after 1988, assist in development of State and Regional Sections of planning schemes;  advice and assistance in the development of regional strategic schemes.

	State Conservation and Local Conservation Strategies;  Environmental plans            and targets, guidelines for ecologically sustainable development, urban            planning and environmental management, preparation of open space plan for            Melbourne including land purchases.

Currently, in 2001, the function is carried out within the Department of Natural Resources and the Environment which is responsible for the Victorian Greenhouse Strategy and the Biodiversity Strategy both related to national and international efforts in these areas.</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Community Council Against Violence was established in 1989 to provide advice to Government about violence in the community. The Council was reconstituted and relaunched in 1993 with agreement from Cabinet. The Council currently includes three task forces: the Victims' Task Force;  the Violence Against Women Task Force and the Community Safety Task Force.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Functions of the Community Council Against Violence include:&lt;BR /&gt;		informing the Government about community concerns relating to violence&lt;BR /&gt;		producing and disseminating accurate information about violence in the community&lt;BR /&gt;		developing and supporting strategies which will foster a reduction in community violence. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Responsibility for the Community Council Against Violence was transferred to the Premier (VRG 50) from the Minister for Police and Emergency Services (VRG 73) as part of the 1991 machinery of government changes and subsequently transferred in 1992 to the joint responsibility of the Attorney-General and the Minister for Police and Emergency Services and Corrections (VRG 19).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;At agency level the Department of Premier and Cabinet assumed responsibility in 1991 for the Community Council Against Violence from the Ministry for Police and Emergency Services (VA 421). In 1992 responsibility for the Council was transferred to the Department of Justice (VA 3085).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;A hazardous chemicals secretariat was established circa July 1990 to conduct a comprehensive review and inquiry into the chemical industry in the State. Following a chemical fire on Coode Island on 21 August 1991 a Coode Island Review Panel was established, with an independent secretariat, to look at short term safety measures and to report on the long term storage of bulk liquid hazardous chemicals in Victoria.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Department of Manufacturing and Industry Development provided significant input into the Review Panel. The Department was also represented on the Government Consultative Reference Group which assisted the Review Panel. In its Annual Report 1991-92 the Department also stated that it had continuing responsibility for ensuring the implementation of reductions in the inventory of bulk hazardous chemicals on the island.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Safer Chemicals Storage Taskforce was established following recommendations contained in the Final Report of the Review Panel. The Taskforce was responsible for the co-ordination, monitoring and reporting of progress on the implementation of recommendations in the Final Report, as well as actually implementing about half of the recommendations. The core recommendation was the development of a new bulk liquid storage terminal for hazardous chemicals at West Point Wilson near Geelong. The first meeting of the Taskforce took place in May 1992. The Safer Chemicals Storage Taskforce Secretariat was established as an associated administrative unit of the Department of the Premier and Cabinet (VA 1039).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Taskforce initiated the preparation of an Environmental Effects Statement (EES) under the guidance of a West Point Wilson Environmental Effects Consultative Committee. In October 1992 the Taskforce Secretariat passed to the Department of Business and Employment (VA 3096).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Taskforce was disbanded at the beginning of December 1993 and the West Point Wilson Project was established to look at bringing the  sector into the relocation of the chemical storage facility.  From 1996 to 1998, after a decision had been made regarding the development of a new port and chemical facility a unit within the Department of State Development was known as the Point Lillias project Unit.  This unit appears to have been disbanded by the end of 1999.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Separation from New South Wales and Government in the Crown Colony of Victoria 1851-1855&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Imperial Australian Constitution Act [No.2] of 1850 (13 and 14 Vic., c.59) was enacted following an enquiry by the Privy Council's Committee of Trade and Foreign Plantations into the constitutional position of the Australian colonies and in response to growing agitation in the colonies for reform of governmental structures and for the separation of the Port Phillip District (Lumb p.16-17).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Under this Act the Governor's role was further limited, but he continued to exercise ultimate executive power and significant controls over the legislature and the Colony's finances.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Imperial Australian Constitutions Act [No.2] of 1850 (13 and 14 Victoria c.59) and the Victorian Constitution Act of 1851 (New South Wales Act 14 Vic., 47) provided for the separation of Victoria from New South Wales from 1 July 1851 and the establishment of a Legislative Council.  Legislative power in the new Colony was vested in the Governor and the Legislative Council.  The Governor did not sit in the Council, but exercised discretionary power in assenting or refusing assent to bills.  The Governor could also transmit bills to the Council for consideration.  The Council consisted of thirty members, ten appointed by the Governor on behalf of the Crown, and twenty elected by and from male electors who met specified property qualifications.  By 1853 there were fifty four elected and eighteen appointed members and by 1855, sixty three elected and nineteen appointed members (including twelve elected from the goldfields following Eureka).  The appointed members included official and non-official nominees.  The official nominees almost invariably supported Government policy and acted in the Legislative Council on instruction from the Governor (Sweetman p.124-125).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;There were significant limitations on the legislative powers of Victoria's first Legislative Council.  The control of crown lands, minerals and related revenue was outside its jurisdiction, and there were also limitations on its powers to impose taxes and appropriate revenue for public purposes (e.g. there were fixed appropriations for the Civil List and public worship).  The Governor exercised considerable power over the Colony's finances and appropriations from the General Revenue were made on his recommendation.  The Council could not enact laws repugnant to British laws and the courts could invalidate local legislation on repugnancy grounds when hearing a particular case.  Certain classes of bills were reserved for royal assent.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The revenue of the Colony was divided into General and Territorial Revenue.  The Governor with the advice and consent of the Legislative Council had power to appropriate the General Revenue, which derived from taxes, duties, rates and imposts, for local needs.  The Imperial Land Sales Act 1842 (5 and 6 Vic., c.36) provided that revenue from the sale of crown land formed the Territorial Revenue and reserved 50% of it for assisted immigration from Britain.  The expenses of the Crown Lands and Survey Departments were also a charge on the Territorial Revenue.  The remaining "unappropriated moiety" of this fund was expended under the direction of the Governor and Executive Council, e.g. on the so-called protection of Aborigines.  During the gold rush revenue from mining licences was also paid into Territorial Revenue and this became a source of agitation in 1851-1852 in the Legislative Council which lobbied the British Government for the right to manage all revenues and refused to appropriate money from the General Revenue to assist in administering the goldfields.  Lieutenant Governor La Trobe was forced to use Territorial Revenue (illegally) for this purpose.  In June 1852 the British Colonial Secretary authorised the surrender of the gold revenue to the Governor and Legislative Council and the use of the unappropriated Territorial Revenue by La Trobe and the Executive Council for the new demands on the administration occasioned by the gold rush.  La Trobe, with the advice of the Executive Council, thenceforth transferred this unappropriated fund to the General Revenue for expenditure authorised by the Legislative Council.  The new Victorian Constitution of 1855 was to provide for parliamentary control of all revenue - the Consolidated Revenue (see below).  (See Sweetman p.129-137.)&lt;BR /&gt;During the 1851-1855 period the executive arm of government was not subject to parliamentary control and ultimate executive power continued to rest with the Governor, who was responsible to the British Government.  The principal officers of government administration were appointed and dismissed by the Governor on behalf of the British Secretary of State for the Colonies.  In some cases they did sit in the Legislative Council in the period 1851 to 1856 as appointed members - the Attorney-General and Solicitor-General from 1851;  the Colonial Secretary, Auditor-General and the Surveyor-General, Commissioners of Police and the Goldfields, and Chairman of General Sessions between 1851 and 1855;  the Collector of Customs from 1853 (from 1855 the Collector of Customs was restyled the Commissioner of Trade and Customs);  the Colonial Engineer in 1854-1855;  the Chief Secretary, Treasurer and Commissioner of Public Works from 1855 (Sweetman p.73-81).  However they were responsible to the Governor and the Imperial Government, not to the Legislative Council, and their Executive appointments were not dependent on their retaining their seats in Parliament and the support of the majority in the Lower House, as was the case after 1855.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Executive Council members during the 1851 to 1856 period were also appointed from the principal officers of the administration and there was considerable overlap in Legislative and Executive Council membership.  The Executive Council comprised the Colonial Secretary, Attorney-General, Treasurer and Collector of Customs from 1851-1855.  An additional member, the Auditor-General was appointed in 1854.  In the transitional period 1855-1856, after the granting of self government and provision by the Victorian Constitution Act 1855 for new legislative arrangements under a system of responsible government, and before the dissolution of the old Legislative Council in March 1856, the memberships of the Legislative and Executive Councils coincided, except for the Commissioners of Police and the Goldfields who sat in the Legislative Council only and the Senior Military Officer who, for this period only, was a member of the Executive Council (Sweetman p.73-81).  La Trobe worked closely with his Executive Council, however Governor Hotham who succeeded La Trobe in June 1854 did not and at times acted against the advice of the Council.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Victorian Constitution Act 1855&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Australian Constitutions Act [No.2] of 1850 enabled the Legislative Council in Victoria to legislate to alter the Colony's constitution and establish a two-house legislature, provided such bills were reserved for royal assent.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;A Select Committee of the Legislative Council was appointed on 1 September 1853 to frame a new constitution for Victoria.  The Constitution Bill which resulted followed Lord Durham's Canadian model of responsible government, providing for two elected Houses of Parliament with almost unlimited legislative power and financial control over all revenue and its use.  The Act went beyond its enabling legislation, attempting to limit the role of the Governor in assenting to bills and providing for parliamentary control over crown land and minerals, the imposition of taxes, and all revenue - hence the term Consolidated Revenue -and its appropriation.  Therefore when it was submitted for royal assent, the bill was amended (removing the limitations on the role of the Governor) and then passed as a Schedule to an Imperial enactment the 1855 Victorian Constitution Statute (18 and 19 Vic.,c.55), which received royal assent on 21 July 1855.  The Victorian Constitution Act was subsequently proclaimed on 23 November 1855.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The new Parliament comprising the Legislative Assembly and the newly constituted Legislative Council, met for the first time on 21 November 1856.  The 1855 Act conferred power on Her Majesty to "make laws for Victoria in all cases whatsoever" -"by and with the advice of the Council and Assembly" (Section 1).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Although many of the formal structures embodied in the 1855 Constitution were similar to those in existence prior to this time, the Act contained a number of provisions which established the preconditions for the evolution of conventions that resulted in far reaching changes in the balance of power between the Governor, the principal officers in the administration (the Ministers of the Crown) and the legislature.  Although the Governor continued to exercise legislative, financial and executive powers in a formal sense, he did so generally on the advice of the Ministers of the Crown in their capacity as members of the Executive Council.  Real executive power under the new formal arrangements - and in accordance with conventions associated with the notion of responsible government - has rested with the group of Ministers (Cabinet) who hold office with the support of Parliament and are summoned to the Executive Council.  Generally the Governor with the advice of the Executive Council has since 1855 exercised formal power only - in practice this formal process is giving effect to Cabinet and Ministerial policy and decisions.  A number of sections of the 1855 Victorian Constitution Act provided the formal basis for responsible government, including the appointment of "responsible officers" (Ministers) by the Governor, with at least four of these appointments to be made from amongst the members of the Parliament (section XVIII) and the appointment of public officers by the Governor with the advice of the Executive Council.  The Officials in Parliament Act 1859 extended these provisions by specifying that all Ministers of the Crown should be appointed as Executive Councillors.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Formal Structure of Government in Victoria from 1855&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Constitutional Arrangements&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The formal structure of Government is set down in the Victorian Constitution Act 1975 (No.8750), which re-enacted with additions and amendments the provisions of the 1855 Victorian Constitution Act (passed as a Schedule to the Imperial Act, the Victorian Constitution Statute, 18 and 19 Victoria c.55, proclaimed on 23 November 1855), and the consolidated Constitution Act Amendment Act 1958 (No.6224). Under the Constitution Acts the Victorian Parliament has the power to repeal alter or vary the Act itself, provided that the second and third readings of amending bills are passed by an absolute majority of the members of each House.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Governor (VA 466) represents the Crown in Victoria (1975 Act, section 6).  On all official state occasions, the Governor performs ceremonial functions as the representative of the Crown.  The Governor is appointed by the British monarch under Letters Patent accompanied by Royal Instructions which refer to the powers conferred on the Governor by the Constitution Act.  Until 1986 they defined classes of bills to be reserved for royal assent.  They also provide for the Governor to grant pardons, make grants of Crown land, and to act on the advice of the Executive Council (VA 2903), unless exceptional circumstances arise (clause VI, Royal Instructions).  The State Government advises the monarch on the appointment of the Governor, this advice being routed through the British Commonwealth and Foreign Office until 1986, when the Australia Acts enabled the Premier to tender advice to the Queen.&lt;... truncated</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;As a function of government, women's affairs appears to have evolved within the Premier's portfolio out of the promotion of equal opportunity under the Equal Opportunity Act 1977 (No.9025) and the provision of advice and information to women through the Community Services Centre, established in 1975.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1975 a Community Services Centre was opened by the Premier with an aim to create greater understanding between all members of society and to create equal opportunities for all. In particular, it was intended to provide information on the activities of government departments and instrumentalities, and also to provide a place for the public to put their problems to trained officers. Located within the Premier's Department (VA 2717), the Centre included several bureaux which carried out functions which later developed within the Premier's portfolio. The Anti-Discrimination Bureau preempted the introduction of the Equal Opportunity Act 1977 (No.9025). The Premier was responsible for equal opportunity until 1985 when responsibility passed to the Attorney-General (VRG 19). &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;An administrative unit responsible for women's affairs was established in April 1978 within the Premier's Department (VA 2717). It appears that the establishment of this unit directly resulted from the introduction of the Equal Opportunity Act 1977 (No.9025) which came into operation between December 1977 and April 1978. The administrative unit took on a broader role than the Women's Advisory Bureau which was part of the Community Services Centre.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Act made it unlawful to discriminate on the grounds of sex (including sexual harassment) and marital status in the areas of employment, education, accommodation and the provision of goods and services.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The 1980 Victorian Government Directory of Administration and Services included within the Premier's portfolio the following two units:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Co-ordinate Committee on the Status of Women &lt;BR /&gt;		to report to the Premier in consultation with the Equal Opportunity Advisory Council on matters of concern to women&lt;BR /&gt;		to promote equality for women&lt;BR /&gt;		to educate the public re the changing roles of men and women.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Office of Co-ordinator of Women's Affairs&lt;BR /&gt;		to examine the medical and legal problems experienced by victims of rape and other sexual assaults&lt;BR /&gt;		to make recommendations re public education measures that would reduce the incidence of rape and other sexual assaults.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;From circa 1980 to 1992 the Premier was responsible, through the Co-ordinator of Women's Affairs (see Department of the Premier VA 2717) and its successor the Women's Policy Co-ordination Unit (see Department of the Premier and Cabinet VA 1039), for:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;		provision of policy advice to the Premier on issues affecting the status of women&lt;BR /&gt;		monitoring and reviewing policies and programs which impact on women&lt;BR /&gt;		co-ordinating and monitoring the activities of agencies with a view to improving the status of women&lt;BR /&gt;		assisting agencies to enhance service delivery to women&lt;BR /&gt;		co-ordinating Victoria's responses to committees and international agencies on women's issues &lt;BR /&gt;		representation of Victoria on Commonwealth-State committees&lt;BR /&gt;		annual Women's Budget report&lt;BR /&gt;		register of women interested in appointment to government boards and committees&lt;BR /&gt;		liaison with non-government organisations providing services to women&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Premier has at times also been referred to as the Minister responsible for Women's Affairs although this does not appear to have been a commissioned position. As part of the machinery of government changes introduced in October 1992 the Attorney-General was also commissioned as Minister for Women's Affairs and an Office of Women's Affairs was established within the Department of Justice (VA 3085). This Office is responsible for:&lt;BR /&gt;		providing advice to the Minister for Women's Affairs, and to the Premier and Cabinet on issues affecting the status of women&lt;BR /&gt;		monitoring and reviewing policies and programs which impact on women&lt;BR /&gt;		assisting agencies to enhance service delivery to women&lt;BR /&gt;		producing the annual Women's Budget report&lt;BR /&gt;		maintaining the register of women interested in appointment to government boards and committees&lt;BR /&gt;		providing administrative support to the Victoria Women's Council&lt;BR /&gt;		representing Victoria on Commonwealth-State committees&lt;BR /&gt;		liaison with non-government organisations providing services to women.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Since 1999 there has once again been a separate Minister for Womens Affairs with an Office of Womens Policy located in the Department of Premier and Cabinet.  Its functions are listed as :&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;providing strategic policy advice to the Government on issues of concern to women; &lt;BR /&gt;coordinating and monitoring government policies and programs which impact on women and their families; &lt;BR /&gt;providing information to women and consulting with women and womens organisations; &lt;BR /&gt;conducting research and identifying emerging trends and issues on the needs of women and effective methods to address those needs.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Under an Order-in-Council published in the Victoria Government Gazette on 23 April 1969 the Geelong Regional Planning Authority was established subject to section 12 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1961.  The Authority was to prepare and submit for approval all planning schemes for any area which extended beyond the boundaries of any one municipal district in the Geelong area.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The region included the municipal districts of:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;   	Geelong&lt;BR /&gt;   	Geelong West&lt;BR /&gt;   	Newtown&lt;BR /&gt;   	Queenscliff&lt;BR /&gt;   	Bannockburn&lt;BR /&gt;   	Barrabool&lt;BR /&gt;   	Bellarine&lt;BR /&gt;   	Corio&lt;BR /&gt;   	South Barwon.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Authority was to consist of 18 members comprising two representatives of each of the municipalities.  It commenced operations on 31 July 1969.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1975 the Geelong Regional Planning Authority Act was passed with the intention of furthering the growth and development of the Geelong area especially through the control of planning aspects.  Section 28(1) of that Act states:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;	The Geelong Regional Authority constituted under this Act shall be deemed to be the same body as the Geelong Regional Planning Authority constituted immediately before this Act.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Abolition&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1977 the Geelong Regional Commission Act was proclaimed and came into effect on 1 August 1977.  The new Commission (VA 426) became the successor in law to the Authority.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Establishment and Role&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The threefold role of the Commission is defined in section 3 of the Geelong Regional Commission Act 1977:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;   	the participation of the people of the Geelong region in planning the future development of the region and the nature and limits of such development&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;   	the planning, co-ordination, integration and management of and for:&lt;BR /&gt;	-	development within the Geelong region&lt;BR /&gt;	-	the improvement and enhancement of the region and the protection of areas within the region of natural beauty or of special significance to the region&lt;BR /&gt;	-	the provision of services and facilities within the region&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;   	the attraction, promotion, development and improvement of industrial, commercial and other business undertakings and employment opportunities to and in the Geelong region.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Commission was established in 1977 under the Geelong Regional Commission Act.  It came into operation on 1 August 1977 (with the first meeting held 12 August 1977) as the successor to the Geelong Regional Planning Authority (VA 2830).  Its creation gave effect to the State Government's decentralisation policies and, in particular, Statement of Planning Policy No.7 (Geelong), which received Governor-in-Council approval in August 1973.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Under the Act, the Commission was responsible to the Minister for State Development and Decentralisation (VRG 51) and successor Ministers - now the Minister for Industry, Technology and Resources (VRG 82), except in respect of the Commission's statutory planning functions under the Town and Country Planning Act for which it was responsible to the Minister for Planning, later known as the Minister for Planning and Environment (VRG 65). &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Responsibility for hearing and determining disputes arising out of the statutory workers' compensation system was vested in County Court Judges and Police Magistrates under the Workers' Compensation Act 1914. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1938 the Workers' Compensation Board was established to arbitrate with respect to workers' compensation disputes. The Board acted as a court of settlement for cases between employers and employees when there was a dispute regarding liability.  Settlements under the Act were to be paid periodically or in a lump sum.  Any lump sum settlements whether disputed or not had to be sanctioned by the Board.  Decisions made regarding the extent of compensation were determined by considering the degree of a person's incapacity.  &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Registrar was to keep a register in the prescribed form containing particulars of the claims for compensation received by the Board and of determinations, awards and orders of the Board upon or arising out of such claims.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1985 there was a major re-organisation of workers compensation in Victoria. Under the provisions of the Accident Compensation Act (No. 10191) and the Occupational Health and Safety Act (No. 10190) the emphasis changed from solely compensating workers for injuries sustained to focussing on the prevention of injury and the rehabilitation of injured workers.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Tribunal was one of four WorkCare agencies set up in 1985 to implement the WorkCare system which had three components: prevention, compensation (claims\dispute resolution and administration of compensation) and rehabilitation. The other three agencies were the Accident Compensation Commission (VA 2732), the Victorian Accident Rehabilitation Council (VA 2697) and the Occupational Health and Safety Commission (VA 1647).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Act came into operation on 1 September 1985 establishing the Tribunal as the legal arm of the WorkCare administration responsible for resolving disputes between employees and employers as to their entitlement to compensation and their liability to pay compensation. In this respect the Tribunal replaced the Workers Compensation Board (VA 876).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The judicial structure of the Tribunal consisted of fourteen judges, twenty one Arbitrators/Conciliators and eight Lay Members. They were initially divided into three divisions:&lt;BR /&gt;	Accident Compensation Division (to handle work related injuries received after 4:00 pm of 31 August 1985)&lt;BR /&gt;	Workers Compensation Division (to handle work related injuries received prior to 4:00pm of 31August1985 i.e. preWorkCare)&lt;BR /&gt;	Contribution Assessment Division (to determine the contribution payable between insurers and the Accident Compensation Commission - abolished circa 1990).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Registrar to the Tribunal was a Statutory Officer whose functions were to arrange for the listing of applications brought to the Tribunal, provide administrative assistance to the Judges and to administer beneficiaries' funds paid into his custody. The Registrar's office was divided into the following branches: Court Management, Investment, Managed Funds, Information Systems and Corporate Services.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Most proceedings before the Accident Compensation Tribunal were initiated by the Accident Compensation Commission or self-insurers.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In March 1990 following the proclamation of the Accident Compensation (General Amendment Act, No 64/1989) two more organisations were established;  the WorkCare Appeals Board, which was responsible for initial resolution of disputes and the Medical Panels, which considered medical questions referred either by the WorkCare Appeals Board or the Accident Compensation Tribunal.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In March 1990 responsibility for all areas of WorkCare passed from the Treasurer (VRG 23) to the Minister for Labour (VRG 42). On 18 March 1991 responsibility for the Accident Compensation Tribunal was transferred to the Attorney-General (VRG 19).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Dispute Resolution Processes &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Compensation claims had to be accepted or rejected within either 28 or 60 days.  Appeal periods of up to 60 days (depending on the nature of the appeal) after denial of a claim were specified in the principal Act. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The method of appeal changed between 1985 and 1993. Until 5 March 1990 the line of formal appeal was from claims agent to the Accident Compensation Commission to the Arbitration Division of the Tribunal to the Tribunal Division of the Tribunal. The 1989 Act established, from March 1990, the WorkCare Appeals Board and Medical Panels. The Medical Panels were established to provide medical advice on claims. The Act also reorganised the Tribunal and its functions. The line of appeal then became from claims agent to the Commission to the WorkCare Appeals Board to the Presidential level of the Tribunal. In January 1992 an additional, discretionary stage was added to the process.  From that date, a claimant could submit additional medical evidence to his or her agent or the WorkCare Appeals Board. If the agent reviewed its decision on the basis of the new evidence, there was no need for the appeal to proceed to the Board. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Under WorkCare an employer who was dissatisfied with an agent's administration of a claim could formally apply to the Commission for a review of the decision.  If dissatisfied with the review the employer could appeal to the Tribunal within 60 days. The result of the review could affect the employer's rating and classification for levy assessment, bonus and penalties purposes.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Within WorkCare the Commission could dispute claims which would initially be presented to the WorkCare Appeals Board and, if still disputed, would be determined by the Tribunal. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Appeals against decisions by the Tribunal could be made to the Supreme Court.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Abolition&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Tribunal was abolished in 1992. Since then responsibility has been split between the following three bodies:&lt;BR /&gt;		the County Court has jurisdiction for applications from workers on all matters except medical and rehabilitation matters.&lt;BR /&gt;		the Magistrates Court has the same jurisdiction as the County Court where the value of the matter is $25,000 or less and for weekly payments up to 26 weeks.&lt;BR /&gt;		the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (from 1998 the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal) has jurisdiction for medical and like services including rehabilitation services, employer levy objections and contributions by prior insurers.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Under WorkCover disputed claims are reviewed by Conciliation Officers engaged under the 1992 Act. The Conciliation Officers succeeded the WorkCare Appeals Board. One of the Victorian WorkCover Authority's functions, therefore, is to accept or reject claims rather than to dispute them since the Conciliation Service is an arm of the Authority - even though the Authority may not overrule or interfere with a Conciliation Officer's decision.  Appeal against the Authority's rejection of a claim is to the Magistrates' or County Court, depending on the subject matter and sum involved. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Disputes over medical diagnoses, treatment or capacity to work are determined by medical panels under WorkCover.  Medical panels' decisions are binding on conciliators and courts.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

Where development proposals involve projects that could have a substantial impact on the environment, such as major engineering works or tourist centres in ecologically sensitive areas, the Minister may require the proponent to prepare an Environment Effects Statement.

This function was developed and administered along with the general environment protection function until 1990 when the Office of the Environment was transferred to the Conservation and Environment portfolio (VRG 94) and this function remained within the Planning portfolio (VRG 65).</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Building Industry Long Service Leave Act 1975 received Royal Assent on 6 May 1976 and provided for the establishment of the Building Industry Long Service Leave Board to administer the Act. The Board was responsible for making payments from a Building Industry Long Service Leave Fund to workers who could establish a long service leave entitlement under the provisions of the Act.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;On 1 August 1983 the Construction Industry Long Service Leave Act 1983 replaced and extended the Building Industry Long Service Leave Act 1975. The Construction Industry Long Service Leave Board (VA 2667) was established replacing the Building Industry Long Service Leave Board.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The 1983 Act continued the long service leave scheme established by the former Act and extended it to include electrical contracting workers and metal trades construction workers.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Board undertook:&lt;BR /&gt;	 registration of construction industry workers&lt;BR /&gt;	 payment of long service leave entitlements&lt;BR /&gt;	 enforcement and policing of the provisions of the Act, through on-site inspections to locate unregistered workers and employers&lt;BR /&gt;	 legal proceedings against persons for non-registration, non-payment of long service leave charges and non-compliance with lawful orders of inspectors.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1997 the Construction Industry Long Service Leave Act  repealed the previous act and dissolved the Board.  From that time the scheme was to be administered in accordance with a trust deed by a company incorporated under  corporations law.  The company (in 2001) operating as trustee for the fund is CoInVEST Pty Ltd. It inherited all of the former Boards property, rights and liabilities.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The legislative basis for the consumer affairs consultation function was the Consumers Protection Act 1964 (No.7237) which established the Consumers Protection Council. The Council's responsibilities were to investigate matters affecting the interests of consumers, to consult interested parties (eg. manufacturers, retailers and advertisers) and to make recommendations to the Minister. This Act defined matters affecting the interest of consumers as any practices used in connection with the advertising, marketing, packaging or labelling of goods or any other matter relating to their fitness for the purpose for which they are offered for sale.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Attorney-General (VRG 19) was the responsible Minister until July 1968 when the administration of the Consumers Protection Act 1964 was transferred to the Minister of Labour and Industry and the Consumers Protection Council became a statutory authority within the Labour and Industry portfolio. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Consumer Affairs Council and the Consumer Protection Bureau were established pursuant to the Consumer Protection Act 1970, operative from 16 November 1970. The Consumer Affairs Council assumed the functions of the Consumers Protection Council with an added function of disseminating information and encouraging consumer education. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Consumer Affairs Committee Act 1983 provided for the establishment of the Victorian Consumer Affairs Committee as  the primary consultative and Ministerial advisory body with respect to matters affecting the interests of consumers. The Committee held it's inaugural meeting on 25 February 1985.  The Act was repealed in 1995 with the consequent dissolution of the Committee.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

The Committee comprised members from employers and employee groups, education and social service organisations, and business and economic advisory groups.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Committee's functions were to:&lt;BR /&gt;		examine employment and employment-related matters&lt;BR /&gt;		report to Cabinet (through a Cabinet Sub-Committee) on employment-related policies and programs upon which action might be recommended&lt;BR /&gt;		consider submissions for financial assistance.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Committee operated through a number of Sub-Committees:&lt;BR /&gt;		Technological Change and Alternative Work Modes&lt;BR /&gt;		Economic Policy&lt;BR /&gt;		Small Business and Co-operatives&lt;BR /&gt;		Regional Employment and Development&lt;BR /&gt;		Youth Employment&lt;BR /&gt;		Assistance to Groups with Special Needs&lt;BR /&gt;		Education, Training and Retraining&lt;BR /&gt;		Community Involvement and Public Awareness.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;It is not certain whether the Committee existed to 1982.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Employment and Training Act 1981 provided for the re-constitution of both the Victorian Employment Committee and the Victorian Technology Advisory Committee (VA 2668). Both Committees (as reconstituted) were appointed and met for the first time in 1982. The re-constituted Committees reported to the Minister of Employment and Training (VRG 42).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Victorian Employment Committee was vested under the Act with responsibility for advising the Minister on a range of issues including:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;		the likely effects of major employment and training proposals&lt;BR /&gt;		the priorities among competing policies&lt;BR /&gt;		ways of ensuring effective co-ordination of the activities of all agencies with employment and training responsibilities.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Committee ceased to exist circa 1986.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Apart from administering the provisions of the Factories and Shops Act the Chief Secretary, through the Chief Inspector of Factories, became responsible in 1897 for the registration and licensing of  employment agencies under the Servants' Registry Offices Act 1897 (61 Vic., No.1489). In 1900 responsibility was transferred to the Minister of Labour. Servants' registry offices were defined as any office which "carried on the business of procuring servants for employers or employment for servants". The Act only applied to manual workers and sought to protect unemployed workers against exploitation by  employment exchanges The legislation provided for regulation the fees which the exchanges could charge to employers and workers.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Act applied to servants' registry offices in the Melbourne Metropolitan District as well as to the municipal districts of Ballarat, Bendigo and Geelong. Appeals against the decisions of the Chief Inspector could be heard by Courts of Petty Sessions. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Servants' Registry Offices Act 1958 was repealed by the Labour and Industry (Amendment) Act 1966. By this time the legislation had become of little relevance as there were few  exchanges remaining and the Commonwealth Employment Service had been established to offer work placement services.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

The Board of Examiners (Scaffolding) was constituted under the Scaffolding Act 1971 which became effective from 1 August 1974.  The prime function of the Board was to hold examinations and issue certificates of qualification as a scaffolding inspector and certificates of competency as a scaffolder or temporary scaffolders permit.  The Board could also conduct inquiries into the capabilities of scaffolding inspectors and suspend or cancel certificates if needed.  Appeals against determinations of the Board could be heard by the County Court.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;This Act was repealed by the Occupational Health and Safety Act 1985 with the Schedules to the Act providing the authority for the continuance of Boards of Examiners and the certification of practitioners.

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In consequence of the increase in unemployment during 1929 and the early part of 1930 Parliament considered measures for the provision of moneys for the relief of unemployment and in May 1930 two Acts were passed - the Unemployment Relief Act 1930 (No.3866) and the Stamps (Unemployment Relief) Act 1930 (No.3868) - authorising the raising of a certain amount of moneys by way of tax on incomes, and stamp duty on wages, for the purpose of providing relief. The increase in unemployment continued and, in December 1930, the Unemployment Relief Amendment Act 1930 (No.3948) was passed providing for the raising of additional moneys. Payments to Departments and Public Authorities for the carrying out of unemployment relief works and payments of sustenance to individual unemployed persons were able to be made from the Unemployment Relief Fund established under these Acts.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;An Unemployment Relief Works Board was constituted on 13 January 1931 with power to approve certain allocations of moneys from the Unemployment Relief Fund for unemployment relief works. The Unemployment Relief (Amendment) Act 1932 (No.4023) provided for the establishment of the Employment Council of Victoria to consider and recommend methods for the prevention and relief of unemployment. The Council superseded the Unemployment Relief Works Board. It appears that these statutory bodies reported to the Treasurer (VRG 23) throughout.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Administration of the allocations of sustenance was the responsibility of the Minister of Labour. Agency responsibility was exercised by a central Sustenance Branch, established within the Department of Labour I and voluntary Public Assistance Committees established within Municipalities (VRG 12). Sustenance included money and the provision of babies' food, meals for school children, clothing and footwear, firewood and rental assistance.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Under the provisions of the Unemployment Relief (Administration) Act 1932 (No.4079) every man who received sustenance was required to perform work (the type of work was prescribed by the Employment Council of Victoria) for the municipality within whose municipal district sustenance was received. On the recommendation of the Employment Council of Victoria a scheme was brought into operation on 3 July 1933 under which genuine unemployed men would be provided with some work each week. Sustenance was provided at the same rates throughout Victoria and was distributed through Public Assistance Committees appointed by municipal councils. The Act also made it a duty of the person receiving sustenance and their relatives to contribute towards the recouping of the Unemployment Relief Fund. Another provision in the Act required persons collecting money for the unemployed, through sales of tokens or admissions to entertainment, to be licensed. Licences were issued either by municipalities or by the Charities Board of Victoria, if the proceeds were to aid relief in more than one municipality.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Details relating to the establishment and exact role of the Sustenance Branch are unclear. The Sustenance Branch appears to have been established circa 1930. The Public Service Lists include the Sustenance Branch, within the Department of Labour, from 1938. The Victorian Year Book's history of the Department of Labour indicates it was formed in 1932. It is mentioned in the Annual Report of the Public Service Commissioner for 1930, that surplus officers of the Railway Department were temporarily transferred to the public service to assist in branches "on account of pressure of work in connection with unemployment". In the Commissioner's Annual Report for 1938 it is reported that certain Railway Officers were transferred to the public service on 4 April 1938. It further notes that the 1930 arrangement whereby Railways Officers were temporarily employed in the Service occurred "at that time when the setting up of a new organisation in the form of a Sustenance Branch" was necessary because of a period of financial stress. This explains why the Sustenance Branch appears for the first time in the Public Service Lists in 1938.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;By 1942 the staffing of the Branch was greatly reduced. This reflected a significant reduction in the amount of sustenance payments being made, largely due to the reduction in unemployment as a result of the war. It was noted in the 1943 Auditor-Generals' report that the persons still receiving sustenance were mainly citizens incapable of sustained work and yet were ineligible for Commonwealth Old Age or Invalid Pensions. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Commonwealth legislation providing for the payment of unemployment, sickness and special benefits came into operation on 1 July 1945. The Sustenance Branch appears to have continued until at least 1948 with a much reduced staff. Final payments of sustenance from the Unemployment Relief Fund were made in the 1952-53 financial year. &lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background

For many years prior to the 1980s the Department of Labour and Industry carried out research and analysis in labour market economics. In 1982 this function was substantially broadened to include a concern with employment policy generally with the passage of the Employment and Training Act 1981 (No.9678) which came into effect 1 January 1982. The Act provided for the establishment of a Ministry of Employment and Training to:

	assist in the social and economic development of the State through
	-	promoting and increasing the opportunities for training and retraining in skills required for industry in Victoria
	-	constant evaluation of training and retraining programmes for industry with particular reference to technological change in industry
	-	encouraging the application of new technologies and innovation in industry
	-	identifying the present and likely future employment opportunities in the State
	-	identifying the present and likely requirements for labour in the various State industries
	-	co-ordinating Government initiatives in respect of employment and training

	facilitate the introduction of new technology in such a way as to minimise adverse social consequences, including
	-	promoting and assisting the establishment and conduct of small businesses, producer co-operatives, work co-operatives, and group employment initiatives
	-	encouraging training and retraining that would improve employment opportunities
	-	examining effective measures to promote employment or alternative work enterprises

	review the statistics of employment and unemployment throughout the State and industries of the State and identifying the causes and extent of unemployment

	facilitate the employment of disadvantaged persons

	assist and encourage the spread of part-time employment and job-sharing schemes.

The Employment and Training Act 1981 also provided for the reconstitution of the Victorian Employment Committee (VA 2583) and the Victorian Technology Advisory Committee (VA 2668). Both Committees were appointed and met for the first time in 1982 - see employment (community consultation) and technological change.

Within its overall employment function the Ministry of Employment and Training (and later the Department of Labour II) exercised responsibility for the following activities:

		Employment Policy

		State Employment Schemes
		- Women's Employment schemes (Maths and Science Incentives program, Technical Skills for Girls program)

		- Job Link (assistance to long-term unemployed over 25 years of age including funding community projects)

		- Job Action (job placement service to place long-term WorkCare claimants into employment - operating in conjunction with the Accident Compensation Commission)

		- Work Entry Scheme (pilot scheme, established March 1989, due to finish June 91, to provide placement assistance to young people with intellectual disabilities)

		- Workstart Victoria (established March 1991 as part of Victoria First Package, building on the Youth Guarantee Scheme which previously assisted 15 to 18 year olds, to provide assistance to 15 to 24 year olds, including: pre-employment training;  youth employment programs;  counselling and placement service;  career information and education programs).

		Labour Market Economics (research, analysis, surveys, forecasts, etc.)

		advice and assistance with the recognition of overseas qualifications (the Overseas Qualifications Unit was established March 1989)

		provision of Equal Employment Opportunity programs in public authorities pursuant to the Public Authorities (Equal Employment Opportunity) Act 1990 (the Unit was established in May 1991)

In 1985 the employment function passed to the Department of Labour II (VA 2777). Employment policies and programs, labour market research and programs focused on disadvantaged groups, including career counselling and placement services were the responsibility of the Office of Employment within the Department of Labour II.

In February 1992 responsibility passed to the Department of Employment and Training within the Ministry of Employment,Post-Secondary Education and Training (VA 1112). 

In December 1992 the Minister for Industry and Employment (VRG 116) assumed responsibility for the employment function. Agency responsibility rested with the Office of Employment within the Department of Business and Employment (VA 3096).

The functions of the Office of Employment were to:
	analyse and forecast employment trends and advise and assist in the development and implementation of employment policies; 

	manage labour market programs focussed on disadvantaged groups, including career counselling and placement services;  and

	advise on employment policies, particularly in respect to those industries which provide opportunities for employment expansion.

The Employment and Training Act 1981 was repealed by the State Taxation (Amendment) Act 1994 and the Public Authorities (Equal Employment Opportunity) Act was repealed by the Public Sector Reform (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act 1998 with all matters previously dealt with by it to be covered by the Public Sector Management and Employment Act 1998.

As a result of administrative changes made after the 1996 election the Office of Employment became part of the Department for State Development.  Subsequent to the 1999 election the Office was moved to the Department of Education, Employment and Training.  Its functions for the last ten years have been listed as:

the development and implementation of initiatives and services to improve employment opportunities for disadvantaged Victorians; 

the provision of strategic employment advice to businesses looking to invest in Victoria or undergoing change; 

research and labour market information to assist with business planning, and

the provision of vocational information and counselling services to migrant Victorians and assessment of overseas qualifications.

       <description type="full">Background

The Victorian Solar Energy Research Committee was established in May 1977 by  Cabinet directive for the purpose of promoting and reviewing all solar energy research, development and demonstration activities within Victoria.

The Committee consisted of a Chairman with members selected and seconded from employers in related fields such as: the Gas and Fuel Corporation of Victoria (VA 1040), State Electricity Commission of Victoria (VA 1002), Department of Mechanical Engineering - University of Melbourne, Department of Minerals and Energy (VA 611), C.S.I.R.O..  Solar Engineering Unit, Public Works Department (VA 699), an Engineering Consultant and a member from the Victorian Brown Coal Council. The Committee reported to the Minister for Minerals and Energy.

The Committee liaised with Australian and overseas organisations involved in the field of solar energy research and development, and evaluated all solar energy research within Australia and, in particular, within Victoria. Grants were provided for the research, development and demonstration of solar energy projects which were constantly monitored and tested by the Committee. The Committee publicised solar energy developments and ways in which solar energy could be used by the public and industry.

In 1980, under the provisions of the Victorian Solar Energy Act 1980 (No.9387), the Victorian Solar Energy Council (VA 1396) was established on 17 December 1980 assuming the functions of the Victorian Solar Energy Research Committee. The Council consisted of a Chairman and three members appointed by the Governor-in-Council. 

Under the provisions of the Act, solar energy was defined more broadly to include wind energy, field energy and fuels produced from biomass and wastes.

The Victorian Solar Energy Council supported and promoted the use of solar energy within Victoria. Grants were allocated for solar energy research for development and demonstration projects involving solar energy, and for the manufacture of solar energy systems and components. The Council was required to review and evaluate solar energy research, development and demonstration projects undertaken in Australia and elsewhere, with particular emphasis on their relevance for Victoria. The Council liaised with organisations concerned with research into and the  development, demonstration or manufacturing of solar energy systems or components.

Additionally, the Council provided advice on how solar energy could be utilised within industry, commerce and by the public and published the benefits of its use in enhancing Australian and Victorian energy resources.

Under the Act, the Minister could established advisory committees, to advise the Council on any matters relevant to its function. Several such committees were appointed.

As part of the Victorian Solar Energy Council Act 1980 (No.9387) the Council was nominated for review by the Public Bodies Review Committee on 1 July 1990. A review was undertaken during 1989 to look at the Council's future role and direction. There were two main recommendations from the review: that there was a need to promote renewable energy in Victoria (energy conservation should be incorporated into the Council's constitution) and the Department of Industry and Office of Economic Planning (VA 3005) should prepare a renewable energy and energy conservation strategy.

The Renewable Energy Authority Victoria was established on 1 July 1990 under the Renewable Energy Authority Victoria Act 1990 (No.40) replacing the Victorian Solar Energy Council. The Energy Information and Education Centre (jointly administered by the Gas and Fuel Corporation (VA 1040), the State Electricity Commission (VA 1002) and the Department of Industry, Technology and Resources (VA 2661)) transferred to the Authority. With this amalgamation the Authority assumed all functions previously administered by the two agencies and operates under the name of Energy Victoria. The amalgamation allowed for greater control of education in energy efficiency and for the encouragement and promotion of energy conservation.

The Authority reported direct to the Minister and was controlled by a Board which consisted of a Chairperson, the General Manager, five people appointed by the Governor-in-Council and an observer appointed by the Minister from the Department of Manufacturing and Industry Development (or its successors).

The Renewable Energy Authority Victoria supported and promoted the research, development and use of renewable energy and energy conservation. Renewable energy includes energy from the sun, wind, waves, tides, the hydrological cycle, biomass and geothermal sources. The Authority provided information and advice on the utilisation of renewable energy and the benefits of energy conservation, to all areas of the Victorian community, including public sector departments and authorities responsible for the supply, development and utilisation of energy. Grants were allocated for the encouragement, promotion and development of an economically viable renewable energy and energy conservation industry, and to provide an incentive for research and the development and demonstration of projects.

Renewable energy and energy conservation educational programs wereundertaken by the Authority. These programs concentrated on primary, secondary and tertiary educational institutions.

The Victorian Government has given a commitment to reduce gases by the year 2005 and the Renewable Energy Authority was to play an important role in this program. The Authority's strategies included:

	concentration on the end use of energy rather than supply;  and

	the provision of information and expertise in renewable energy and energy conservation and education programs.

In 2000 the Government passed the Renewable Energy Authority Victoria (Amendment) Act (to be retitled the Sustainable Energy Authority Victoria Act).  The Renewable Energy Authority was abolished and replaced by the Sustainable Energy Authority Victoria.  The main purpose was to alter the composition of the authority and its objectives and functions.  The functions of the new authority are:

provide independent energy saving advice and information; 

promote the benefits of energy conservation in the community; 

encourage and facilitate the adoption of sound energy management practices in government and business; 

promote energy labelling of appliances and energy efficient house design; 

advise the Minister on policies concerning energy efficiency and renewable energy.

In December 2002, as part of a cabinet reshuffle following the re-election of the Bracks government, responsibility for the Sustainable Energy Authority Victoria transferred from the Minister for Energy and Resources (VRG 133) to the Minister for Environment (VRG 147).</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Prior to the establishment of the Office of the Public Solicitor (VA 2282) in 1929 under the provisions of the Poor Persons Legal Assistance Act 1927 (No.3548), legal assistance in civil and matrimonial cases was granted in accordance with the rules of the Supreme Court and legal assistance to persons committed for trial for an indictable offence was granted by the Attorney General after consideration of an application for legal aid made by the accused to a judge of the Supreme Court, a chairman of a court of general sessions or to a police magistrate.  (See also the Poor Persons Defence Act 1916 (No.2831) and the Crimes Act 1915 (No.2637 pt.v.)&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Public Solicitor provided legal aid (subject to a strict means test) in indictable criminal cases, divorce and matrimonial cases, and civil cases in the Supreme and County Courts. Legal aid was not available for proceedings in the courts of petty sessions.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Following representations from the Council of the Law Institute and the Victorian Bar Council, the Legal Aid Committee was established in 1963 under the provisions of the Legal Aid Act 1961 (No.6805).  The Legal Aid Committee administered the Legal Aid Fund, and under the scheme established by the Act, Solicitors in  practice provided legal aid representation to people who required assistance but who failed the means test and for people involved in proceedings in the courts of petty sessions. Solicitors were reimbursed for part of their legal costs from the Legal Aid Fund and the Government met the administrative costs of the scheme.  &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Legal Aid Committee was empowered to provide legal aid in any case, but in practice only provided legal aid in cases where the Public Solicitor did not normally provide legal aid. (The Legal Aid Committee could be more flexible in determining which cases to accept, what charges should apply, and was not compelled to apply a means test as was the Public Solicitor). The Committee could therefore provide aid in any criminal, divorce and matrimonial, or civil proceeding in either the Supreme Court, the County Court or a Court of Petty Sessions.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Public Solicitor continued to provide assistance for both civil and criminal proceedings, but the Legal Aid Committee gradually became responsible for a higher proportion of civil cases. In 1970, under the provisions of the Legal Aid Act 1969 (No.7919), the Legal Aid Committee became responsible for divorce and matrimonial and civil cases, cases that were previously provided for by the Public Solicitor.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;With the establishment by the Commonwealth Government of the Australian Legal Aid Office in 1974, legal aid for cases that involved people on social security benefits or in Commonwealth law matters, was provided for by the Australian Legal Aid Office. This included divorce proceedings. Legal aid matters in which the Australian Legal Aid Office could grant aid were generally not handled by the Committee, although the Committee was empowered to handle them if it chose to.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Office of the Public Solicitor continued to provide legal assistance for indictable criminal proceedings until 1981. The Legal Aid Committee continued to provide legal assistance for criminal, divorce and matrimonial and civil cases until 1981.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1981, under the provisions of the Legal Aid Commission Act 1978 (No.9245) the Legal Aid Commission (VA 877) was established.  Its establishment represented a significant redefinition and extension of the concept of legal aid to include the provision of education, advice and information about the law, legal services, duty lawyer services and legal advice.  The Legal Aid Commission inherited responsibility for the provision of legal services from the Legal Aid Committee and the Office of the Public Solicitor and assumed responsibility for the provision of legal advice from the Australian Legal Aid Office.  &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Legal Aid Commission was responsible for the provision of:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;   	Legal assistance being the provision of legal services.  The level of assistance was largely determined by the financial circumstances of the applicant.  Some applicants received the services without charge;  others were required to make a contribution towards the cost of the services provided.  The services may have been provided by the staff of the Commission or by solicitors and barristers in  practice.&lt;BR /&gt;   	Legal advice being the provision of free advice on legal matters including civil, criminal and welfare matters.&lt;BR /&gt;   	Duty lawyer services being the provision of legal services by the staff of the Commission who attended courts and appeared for persons who were without representation.&lt;BR /&gt;   	Education and information including community education;  the funding of community legal centres and neighbourhood mediation centres;  the training of legal staff;  community library services and law reform activities.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Commission was responsible to the Attorney General and received funding from the Commonwealth and Victorian Governments and from interest earned on the investment of solicitors trust funds, contributions made by persons receiving legal assistance and legal costs awarded by the courts to assisted persons.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Victoria Legal Aid (VLA) was a statutory corporation established by the Legal Aid Commission (Amendment) Act 1995 (No.48/1995).  It replaced the Victorian Legal Aid Commission with effect from 14 December 1995.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;VLAs duties were specified in the Act (s.7) and included: &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;ensuring that legal aid was provided in the most effective, efficient and economical manner, and in a manner which dispels fear and distrust; &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;establishing local offices and using its best endeavours to make legal aid available throughout the state; &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;deciding the matters or classes of matters for which legal assistance may be provided; &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;deciding priorities between people and matters for legal aid; &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;liaising with legal practitioners professional bodies to facilitate the use, in appropriate circumstances, of services provided by  practitioners; &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;maximising the use of voluntary services by  practitioners; &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;informing the public of VLAs services and the conditions which attach to the services;  and&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;encouraging and permitting the voluntary participation of law students in providing legal aid, under professional supervision.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Victoria Legal Aid has seven divisions: &lt;BR /&gt;Family and Civil Law &lt;BR /&gt;Criminal Law &lt;BR /&gt;Knowledge and Community Resources &lt;BR /&gt;Regional Offices &lt;BR /&gt;Grants &lt;BR /&gt;Finance and Administration &lt;BR /&gt;Information Systems&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Act also required VLA to control and administer the Legal Aid Fund (s.6).  The Fund (s.41) includes all moneys from State or Commonwealth government grants, from funds controlled by the Legal Practice Board, moneys awarded by the Appeal Costs Board, legal costs recovered, income from the investment of moneys in the fund and client contributions to grants of assistance.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The VLA provided services at its Melbourne office, at ten regional offices and at courts, jails and other institutions.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Victorian Taxation Board of Review was established under the Taxation Appeals Act 1972 (No.8274) to review decisions, assessments and determinations relating to tax and duty payable under various acts.  The acts specified and amended by the Act were the Land Tax Act 1958, the Stamps Act 1958, the Probate Duty Act 1962, the Gift Duty Act 1971 and the Pay-roll Tax Act 1971.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Board of Review had the "power to review such decisions of the Commissioner [as defined below] as are referred to it under any act" (Act 8274 Section 11).  The Board was to give its decisions in writing and, upon the request of any party to the proceedings, was to state in writing its findings in fact and its reasons for the decision in law. For the purposes of the Act the "Commissioner" was defined as:&lt;BR /&gt;	the Commissioner (or Deputy Commissioner) of Land Tax under the Land Tax Act; &lt;BR /&gt;	the Comptroller (or Deputy or Assistant Comptroller) of Stamps under the Stamps Act; &lt;BR /&gt;	the Commissioner (or Deputy Commissioner) of Probate Duties under the Probate Duty Act; &lt;BR /&gt;	the Commissioner within the meaning of the Gift Duty Act;  and&lt;BR /&gt;	the Commissioner (or Deputy Commissioner) under the Pay-roll Tax Act.&lt;BR /&gt;The Business Franchise (Petroleum Products) Act 1979 amended the Taxation Appeals Act by extending the definition of "Commissioner" to include:&lt;BR /&gt;	the Commissioner of Business Franchises in relation to licence fees payable under the Business Franchise Acts.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The commencement date of the agency is uncertain but the act which established it was proclaimed on 1 January 1977, so the agency is assumed to have commenced then. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Taxation Appeals Act was amended substantially between 1972 and 1982.  The scope of those amendments has not been examined in detail.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Taxation Appeals Act was repealed by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1984 (No.10155). From 1984 the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (VA 2659) assumed the review function of tax related matters.  The reviews or appeals were heard by the Tribunal in its Taxation Division which&lt;BR /&gt;had jurisdiction to consider applications for review of decisions made under certain sections of the following acts:&lt;BR /&gt;	Business Franchise (Tobacco)&lt;BR /&gt;	Energy Consumption Levy&lt;BR /&gt;	Financial Institutions Duty&lt;BR /&gt;	Gift Duty &lt;BR /&gt;	Land Tax&lt;BR /&gt;	Payroll Tax &lt;BR /&gt;	Probate Duty&lt;BR /&gt;	Stamps&lt;BR /&gt;	&lt;BR /&gt;The Administrative Appeals tribunal was replaced in 1998 by the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal.  Taxation appeals are heard by the Administrative Division of the Tribunal through the Taxation List.  It hears disputes over assessments made by State Government Departments in the imposition of State levies and taxes such as stamp duties, pay-roll tax and business franchises (petroleum and tobacco).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Further research is required to determine venues of appeal which may have existed prior to 1977, including appeals to the Supreme Court, other bodies, responsible ministers etcetera. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Note re Land Valuation Boards of Review&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;There is a relationship between the Victorian Taxation Board of Review and the Land Valuation Boards of Review (LVBR) VA 1378.  The latter agency was established by the Land Tax (Rates and Appeals) Act1963 (No.7009), which is to be read in conjunction with the Land Tax Act1958.  Also under the Land Tax Act (prior to LVBR being established) there was a provision for the hearing of objections to assessments being heard by an Assessment Court to be constituted under that Act.  There was also provision for appeal to the Supreme Court.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;It is probable that appeals or objections or requests for review of decisions under all of the act mentioned in the body of the text above were heard or determined prior to the establishment of the Victorian Taxation Board of Review.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Prior to the establishment of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in 1984 appeals against decisions and reviews of decisions, made by a number of bodies under various Acts could be heard by the County Court and specific tribunals. The history of each type of appeal has not been researched, however, it is known that the County Court could hear appeals against decisions of the Estate Agents Board and the Crimes Compensation Tribunal while applications for review of decisions of the Motor Accidents Board were heard to 1985 by the Motor Accidents Tribunal (VA 1069).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1984 (No.10155) established the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT). The relevant sections of the Act came into operation on 5 December 1984. Section 19 of Act 10155 provided that the Tribunal would operate under two divisions, the General Division and the Taxation Division, as well as "such other divisions as are prescribed". (See Appeals, Taxation for information about the function of the Taxation Division).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The General Division had jurisdiction to hear appeals against decisions and review decisions made under certain sections of the following acts:&lt;BR /&gt;	Adoption;  &lt;BR /&gt;	Criminal Injuries Compensation;  &lt;BR /&gt;	Estate Agents;  &lt;BR /&gt;	Freedom of Information;  &lt;BR /&gt;	Motor Accidents;  &lt;BR /&gt;	State Employees Retirement Benefits Fund;  &lt;BR /&gt;	Infertility (Medical Procedures);  &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The primary object of the Tribunal was to review administrative decisions in an informal and expeditious manner and to permit a broad range of persons whose interests were affected by a decision to participate in a proceeding. Preliminary conferences were frequently employed by the Tribunal to identify points of law and to seek to reach agreement between parties to an appeal without the need to proceed to a full hearing.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The process of reforming the tribunal systems began in 1995 with a paper entitled Tribunals in the Department of Justice: A principled approach. The research report advocated the establishment of a new system that would bring greater consistency in the way tribunals approached matters.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal was established under the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 1998 as part of a package of reforms to improve the operation of the justice system. A number of tribunals were amalgamated and procedures were standardised. These changes diminished the significant overlap of responsibilities that had existed.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;VCAT was created to offer a one-stop shop dealing with a range of disputes in its two divisions  Civil and Administrative. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Administrative division deals with disputes between people and the government in relation to land valuation, licenses to carry on business, planning, state taxation and other government decisions such as freedom of information requests and Transport Accident Commission decisions. It consists of the following lists:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;General List &lt;BR /&gt;Land Valuation List&lt;BR /&gt;Occupational and Business Regulation List &lt;BR /&gt;Planning List &lt;BR /&gt;Taxation List&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Before VCAT was established these matters were dealt with by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and other tribunals.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;One significant use for land valuations has been for the assessment of land tax.  The Victorian Land Tax Act 1910 (No.2284) provided for a tax to be levied on the unimproved value of land and for the general assessment of land values.  Valuations for this purpose were able to be undertaken by valuers employed under the Act, or were able to be obtained from any local authority, which included municipal councils or any other agency empowered to make and levy rates.  Valuers were subsequently employed under the Act within the Department of the Treasurer (VA 865).  This situation changed from 1 January 1969 following proclamation of section 3(b) of the Land Tax Act 1968 (No.7773) which determined that valuations which could be used for the assessment and levy of taxation included: those made by a rating authority within the meaning of the Valuation of Land Act 1960;  those made by the Valuer-General or a valuer nominated by the Valuer-General;  those made under the Land Tax Act prior to the coming into operation of section 3(b) of the 1968 legislation.  This effectively resulted in the transfer, in 1969, of the valuation staff of the Land Tax (Valuation) Branch of the Department of the Treasurer (VA 8655) to the Local Government Department, significantly expanding the size and functions of the Office of the Valuer-General.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;It is believed that the provision of valuations for land tax assessment ceased to be a function of the office of the Valuer-General in the early 1970's.  To the current day, valuations are supplied to the land tax section of the State Revenue Office by the various municipalities.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The earliest taxes imposed in Victoria were customs duties which were placed upon a range of imported and exported goods and were administered by the Department of Trade and Customs (VA 606) from 1851. Of all colonial taxes, import and export duties were by far the most significant, accounting for approximately one quarter of the Colony's revenue, however jurisdiction for all customs duties was transferred to the Commonwealth upon federation in 1901 - see customs.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Throughout the second half of the nineteenth century the government introduced a number of taxes and duties administered by various offices within the colonial government. The most notable of these were duties on estates of deceased persons, land tax and duties on the production of tobacco and beer.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Duties on the estates of deceased persons (probate duties) were introduced under the Duties on the Estates of Deceased Persons Act 1870 (34 Vic., No.388). Payment of probate duties was initially made to the Master-in-Equity, Supreme Court.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;An early form of land tax was introduced under the Land Tax Act 1877. This tax was administered by the Chief Secretary's Department to 1884 and then by the Department of Crown Lands and Survey.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Income tax was introduced into Victoria in 1895 under the Income Tax Act 1895 (No.1374).  This Act imposed a tax on all income derived by any person either by personal exertion or from the produce of property.  It also introduced a tax on the revenue of companies.  In order to administer this tax an Income Tax Office was established within the Treasury. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Circa 1903 responsibility for the administration of land tax transferred to the Treasurer expanding the ambit of the Taxation Office. Circa 1911 the Taxation Office within Treasury assumed responsibility for probate duties.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Although the Commonwealth introduced a separate income tax prior to the Second World War, the states remained the major collectors of income tax until the 1940's.  However due to the increased financial demands placed upon it during the Second World War the Commonwealth Government passed legislation in 1942 effectively removing from the states the right to collect income tax and establishing a uniform national tax system.  To compensate the states for the loss of their income tax revenue a system of annual grants from the Commonwealth to the states was introduced.  Initially these arrangements were to cease at the end of the war, but they were later extended indefinitely, the basis upon which grants were made changing from one of compensation for loss of previous tax revenue to one of states' needs.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1942 the State Taxation Office dealt with the assessment and collection of State Income Tax, Federal Income Tax, Special Income Tax, Unemployment Relief Tax, State Land Tax, Probate Duty and Entertainments Tax. By late 1943 the State Taxation Office only handled the collection and assessment of State Land Tax and Probate Duty. At this time the Office undertook the recording of all sales of properties and changes of ownership as well as particulars of ownership and values of most of the properties in the State. Nine departmental valuers were employed in checking and revising values not only for Land Tax but also for Stamp Duty and Probate Duty purposes and for other Government Departments. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Throughout the 1950's and 1960's the Victorian Government introduced a number of indirect taxes to compensate for the loss of its income tax revenue.  The state continued to administer probate duties, land tax, taxes on the issue of a range of licences, motor vehicle registrations and on betting through the TAB and bookmakers' takings, amongst others.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;From 29 December 1962 entertainments tax was levied in Victoria only on admissions to horse racing and trotting meetings.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;A division of the Department of the Treasurer continued to oversee the administration of these taxes and from the early 1970's onwards became known as the State Taxation Office or State Tax Office.  On 1 September 1971 the right to impose payroll tax was transferred from the Commonwealth to the states and in Victoria the Payroll Tax Act 1971 (No.8154) established a system for administering the tax.  Since that time payroll tax has been the State's most important source of tax revenue.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;As from 1 January 1972 the Gift Duty Act 1971 (No.8176) imposed duty on gifts (including gifts and settlements of property) formerly imposed only under the Stamps Acts. The Gift Duty (Amendment) Act 1981 (No.9626) effectively removed gift duty from gifts made on or after 1 January 1983. Gift and death duties were also imposed by the Commonwealth Government until 1979.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In the 1980's the Commonwealth Government alone exercises the right to impose customs and excise duties, sales tax and personal and company income tax.  The ambit of taxation now left to the states comprises motor taxation, stamp duties, liquor, land, lottery, racing, payroll and entertainment taxes.  The collection of gift duties is shared between the Commonwealth and the states as are probate duties.  The latter were abolished in Victoria on 1 January 1984.  Since that time the State Tax Office has collected duties on a decreasing number of estates relating to deaths prior to 1984.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The State Revenue Office was established under Administrative Arrangements Order No.106 effective from 28 April 1992. The Order effectively merged the Stamp Duties Office and State Taxation Office which were operating independently within the Department of the Treasury.  The Order also created the position of Commissioner of State Revenue to replace the positions of Commissioner of Taxation, Comptroller of Stamps, Commissioner of Pay-roll Tax, Commissioner of Land Tax, Commissioner of Probate Duties and Commissioner of Business Franchises.&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Stamp Duty is an ancient tax imposed on "instruments" (documents) rather than transactions. Many types of agreement cannot be enforced unless they are put into writing and stamp duty is paid. As at 2001 the Victorian Government imposes stamp duty on conveyances, or transfers, of real property as well as various stampable documents such as agreements, deeds, powers of attorney and mortgages.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Stamp Duties Act 1879 (43 Vic., No.645) provided for the granting, management and collection of stamp duties.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Note re Administrative Arrangements&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Public Service Lists for December 1929 show the Stamp Duties Office as a branch of the Attorney-General's Department and a separate Taxation Office which is a branch of the Department of the Treasurer. By December 1932 the Stamp Duties Office has become a branch of the Taxation Office. The Stamp Duties Office soon became an independent office within the Treasurer's Department. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The inward correspondence registers of the Department of the Treasurer (VPRS 1212/P1 Registers of Inward Correspondence) include in Unit 11 (Jan-Jun 1930) entries for correspondence from the Treasurer and the Public Service Commissioner relative to the transfer of the Stamp Duties Branch of the Law Department to the Taxation Office within Treasury. It appears from the summaries of the correspondence that the transfer of officers took effect from 1 July 1930.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Stamp Duties Office remained separate from the Taxation Office until 1992 when the two offices merged to become the State Revenue Office under Administrative Arrangements Order No.106 effective from 28 April 1992. The Order also created the position of Commissioner of State Revenue to replace the positions of Commissioner of Taxation, Comptroller of Stamps, Commissioner of Pay-roll Tax, Commissioner of Land Tax, Commissioner of Probate Duties and Commissioner of Business Franchises.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

State entertainments tax ceased to operate from 1 September 1943 and from 1 October 1943 the Commonwealth became the sole authority for entertainments tax. Similar to the transfer of income tax to the Commonwealth in 1942, Federal legislation provided for the State to be reimbursed by the Commonwealth for the lost revenue.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1953 the Commonwealth vacated this field of taxation and the Victorian Government reimposed a tax on entertainments from 8 October 1953 in accordance with the Entertainments Tax Act 1953.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Under the provisions of the Entertainments Tax (Amendment) Act 1961, operative from 1 January 1962, the tax on live artist entertainments and on amateur sport was abolished and a separate reduced scale of rates was applied to cinematograph films and dancing.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Entertainments (Partial Abolition) Act 1962 abolished tax on all classes of entertainments except horse racing and trotting as from 29 December 1962.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Entertainments Tax Act 1973 (No.8472) repealed the Entertainments Tax Act 1958 effectively abolishing entertainments tax from 1 December 1973.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Armed Forces comprised individual army and navy units and military districts between 1826 and 1901.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Western Port Military Establishment 1826 to 1828&lt;BR /&gt;The Western Port Establishment was administered by the Crown Colony of New South Wales. Fear of French incursions seems to have motivated the British Government to instruct New South Wales Governor Darling to establish posts on the south and west coastlines of Australia.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;A party of forty, including twenty convicts, under Captain Wright and Lieutenant Burchell on board the Fly and the Dragon, arrived at Western Port in November 1826.  The Establishment was military not penal in character and was abandoned in January 1828 once fears of the French subsided.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;1836 to 1854&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;A detachment of Imperial Troops of the 4th King's Own Regiment under the command of Police Magistrate Captain William Lonsdale arrived in the Port Phillip District in 1836. From then until 1870 various Imperial regiments had responsibility for the defence of Victoria.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Imperial forces drew their pay from the "military chest" supplied by the Imperial government. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Imperial troops also performed a wide range of duties, apart from their obvious defence duties, for which they were paid out of the colonial revenue.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In the early years detachments of Imperial troops:&lt;BR /&gt;   	performed garrison duty&lt;BR /&gt;   	assisted with the policing of the colony&lt;BR /&gt;   	accompanied survey parties&lt;BR /&gt;   	attempted to prevent conflict between the settlers and Aborigines.&lt;BR /&gt;During the 1850's they also provided the gold escort and their role at Eureka Stockade is well known.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;1854 to 1870&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In November 1854 an Act was passed authorising the enrolment of a volunteer corps to be placed under the supervision of Her Majesty's regular forces.  The Melbourne Volunteer Rifle Regiment, the Victorian Yeomanry Corps and the Geelong Volunteer Rifle Corps were established under this Act.  &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Volunteer Forces (naval and military) could be mobilized in the event of invasion or attack.  The naval force was strengthened by the arrival of the Steam Sloop Victoria in 1856 and other vessels in subsequent years. When in 1860 the regular forces were transferred to New Zealand at the outbreak of the Maori Wars, the Volunteer Forces assumed their responsibilities.  &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Between 1854 and 1858 the Colonial Government undertook the payment of Imperial troops as well as the newly established volunteer forces.  After 1858 the Imperial Government resumed providing funds for the former until 1870 when all Imperial troops were withdrawn from the colony.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In July of 1858 the total strength of the regular and volunteer forces in Victoria was 1,112.  In 1863 the volunteer forces were re-organised under the provisions of the Volunteer Corps Amendment Act 1863.  The re-organised forces consisted of more than 3600 men in a Naval Brigade, an engineer corps (Victorian Volunteer Engineers), 7 artillery companies (Royal Victorian Volunteer Artillery) and 13 rifle companies (Victorian Volunteer Rifles).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;1870 to 1901&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;At the intercolonial conference of 1870 it was agreed that the conditions laid down for the maintenance of Imperial troops in the Colonies were not acceptable and that the Colonies would have to rely on their own resources for military protection. On the other hand it was decided that  the naval defence of the coastline and defence of the commerce in Colonial ports was a matter primarily for the Imperial Government. Accordingly, in 1870 all Imperial military forces were withdrawn from the Colony. Naval and coastal defence remained a direct responsibility of the Imperial government until Federation.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Thereafter permanent Colonial Military Forces were created for land defence and some local naval units did operate in Victorian waters.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;During 1884 the volunteer forces were replaced by militia with rifle clubs being established to absorb volunteer enthusiasts that could not find time for regular training. In 1885 the country districts formed a regiment of mounted rifles and in 1888 an Infantry Regiment, the Victorian Rangers, was raised. In 1897 a Scottish regiment composed entirely of volunteers made it's appearance.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1899 the first contingent of Victorian troops to undertake overseas duty departed for service in the Boer War.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Early Links Between Military and Civil Service&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Military officials were also often "seconded" into civil service duties for which they were paid from Colonial revenue.  This was especially so in areas of government administration where technical skills were required.  The first public buildings in Melbourne were erected by soldiers under Captain Lonsdale's command but were paid under colonial charge for these extra duties.  Robert Hoddle was employed as Melbourne's first surveyor for which his salary was paid as a civil servant but he remained an officer of the Corps of Royal Military Surveyors and Draftsmen on half-pay.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Detachments of Mounted Police were drawn from infantry regiments stationed in New South Wales.  They were posted on overland routes and attached to Police Magistrates' Districts to assist in general police duties.  They also served with the gold escort and Goldfields forces attached to the Goldfields Commissioners (see also VRG 25 Mining Districts).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Commissioners of Crown Land, the Superintendent of Water Police, the Agent for Colonial Contracts, and the Overseer of Convicts were all in the early days of settlement drawn from the military into the civil service.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Further Research Required&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Further research is required to establish lines of responsibility for central administration and co-ordination of the armed forces prior to 1883 and the links to related agencies.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Free Libraries and Municipal Library Services&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;As in other States the provision of free libraries in Victoria by local government bodies was retarded, mainly because of the lack of tradition in local government for initiative and funds in educational matters. Although by 1913 there were over 500 Mechanics Institutes, they were never free public lending libraries, and after 1890 their quality declined. However, a few municipalities such as Collingwood, Hawthorn, Fitzroy, Northcote and South Melbourne did provide a free library service.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In the 1920s professional organisations of librarians and later, persons such as the late Sir John Latham, Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, bega a campaign against deficiencies in the library services, and the Munn-Pitt Report in 1935 created enough interest for action to be taken. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;By the 1940s less than 15% of Victorias population was served by free public libraries. The lack of library services within both metropolitan and regional districts of Victoria prompted the establishment in 1947 of a separate Free Library Service Board to promote, inspect, and organise public library services throughout the State. It was also responsible for advising the minister and councils on matters of general policy relating to free libraries.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Libraries were to be maintained by municipalities from both municipal funds and from subsidies and grants made by the Victorian government made through the Free Library Service Board. The libraries were to consist of councils that established, on a cooperative basis, a regional library committee to administer library services for the region. The committee in each region was to employ library staff and authorise the purchase of books and other library materials and to be generally in charge of public library services within the region. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The establishment of the Library Council of Victoria 1965&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1963 the Governor in Council appointed Sir John Jungwirth to sit as a Board of Inquiry to assess the library situation in Victoria and to make recommendations for future development. The subsequent report, published in 1964, stressed the need for cooperation and coordination to develop library services in Victoria. Accordingly the Library Council of Victoria Act 1965 set up a single council- the Library Council of Victoria- to carry out the functions of the Free Library Service Board and those of the State Library Trustees. The Free Library Service Board was redesignated the Public Libraries Division of the Library Council of Victoria. Following the pattern established by the Free Library Service Board, the Public Libraries Division was concerned with the promotion, subsidy, inspection, and organisation of public libraries throughout Victoria. In addition, the Division offered a wide-ranging advisory service concerning all aspects of public librarianship in Victoria.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Council was to consist of a president and eight members appointed by the Governor in Council. The Act provided that of the eight other members, six should meet certain qualifications. One should be a person distinguished in the field of education;  one should represent municipalities within the Melbourne metropolitan area defined under the Act;  another, the municipalities outside the metropolitan area;  and one of the members should be a professional librarian appointed from a panel of names submitted by the Victorian Branch of the Library Association of Australia.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The principal functions of the Council regarding municipal libraries were to: &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;assist in the promotion, organisation, and supervision of free library services (including childrens libraries) by municipal councils; &lt;BR /&gt;advise on matters of general policy relating to free libraries; &lt;BR /&gt;make recommendations to the Minister on the allocation of funds made available by the Victorian Parliament to assist free libraries; &lt;BR /&gt;provide advisory services to free libraries and associated institutions; &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Administrative restructuring&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Under the provisions of the Ministry for the Arts Act 1972, the municipal library function became administered by Victorias first Ministry for the Arts. The Ministry was established in an effort to advise and cooperate with other bodies concerned with the promotion and practice of arts in Victoria.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Libraries Act 1988&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;As part of a government initiative to bring greater efficiency to the library network by providing a more focussed approach to the development of library policies the Libraries Act 1988 established two bodies: the Libraries Board of Victoria and the Council of the State Library of Victoria. The Libraries Board of Victoria was a cross sectional representative body, which was basically an advisory Board for the Minister of the Arts on Library matters.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The functions of the board were the following:&lt;BR /&gt;to make recommendation to the Minister on the allocation of funds made available for promotion and advancement of cooperation between libraries and information organisations; &lt;BR /&gt;to monitor developments in matters relevant to libraries and information organisations and evaluate their potential use&lt;BR /&gt;to promote and encourage research in matters relevant to libraries and information organisation;  &lt;BR /&gt;to receive advice form advisory groups established by the board&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Office of Library Services, a division of Arts Victoria, serviced the functions, responsibilities and activities of the Libraries Board of Victoria and its committees.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Arts Institutions (Amendment) Act  1996 &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In February 1997 the Victorian Government proclaimed the sections of the Arts Institutions (Amendment) Act 1996 that created the Library Board of Victoria, which replaced the former Libraries Board of Victoria and Council of the State Library of Victoria. The new Board was to combine the state-wide policy role of the Libraries Board with the State Library governance responsibility of the Council. The new act was to confer greater responsibility and accountability on the Board, while also providing opportunities for the Library to play a more vital leadership role in the state-wide network of libraries and information providers.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Board was subject to the direction and control of the Minister for the Arts.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The functions of the Board in regard to municipal libraries were to:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;oversee cooperation in programs with libraries and information organisations to promote access to library and information services and resources; &lt;BR /&gt;exercise leadership and promote high standards in the provision of library and information services; &lt;BR /&gt;provide advice and information to the Minister on any matter concerning libraries and information organisations.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Arts Institutions (Amendment) Act 1996 disbanded the Office of Library Services and its responsibilities divided between the Office of Local Government and the State Library of Victoria in September 1996. Those responsibilities relating to policy development and coordination of state-wide services to libraries were transferred to the new Library Board of Victoria and carried out by the State Librarys Network Services Division. Responsibility of recurrent funding to municipal library services was invested in the Office of Local Government, Department of Infrastructure.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Sources&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Cannon, M., Melbourne after the Gold Rush, Loch Haven Books, Main Ridge, Victoria, 1993&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Cannon, M., Old Melbourne Town  Before the Gold Rush, Loch Haven Books, Main Ridge, Victoria, 1991&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Cyclopedia of Victoria, Volume 1, The Cyclopedia Company, Melbourne, 1903&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Victorian Yearbook 1973, 1981&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Victorian Parliamentary Debates, 1944 - 1996&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Free Library Service Board, Annual Reports, 1947  1964&lt;BR /&gt;Library Council of Victoria, Annual Reports, 1965 - 1988&lt;BR /&gt;Libraries Board of Victoria, Annual Reports, 1997 - 1998&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Victorian Government Directory, 1983 - 1996&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Legislation&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;State Library National Gallery National Museum and Institute of Applied Science Act 1960 (No.6688) (Vic.)&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Library Council of Victoria Act 1965 (No.7364) (Vic.)&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Libraries Act 1988 (No.80) (Vic.)&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Arts Institutions (Amendment) Act 1996 (No. 61) (Vic.)&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The first Government controlled savings bank had been established on 1 January 1842 under New South Wales legislation.  Known as the Savings Bank of Port Phillip it was administered by a Board of Trustees and a Vice-President.  Branches of this Bank were subsequently established in other parts of the colony.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1853 a statutory body known as The Commissioners of Savings Banks in the Colony of Victoria was constituted under the Savings' Bank Act 1853 16 Vic., No.37.  This body of Government appointed Commissioners was given responsibility for the direction of the Savings Bank of Port Phillip and its various branches.  Each bank was thereafter to be a separate and independent institution with its own trustees and officers.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Savings Banks Act 1890 Amendment Act 1896 (No.1481) introduced several major changes.  The Commissioners of Savings Banks and the Post Office Savings Banks were amalgamated, thereafter to be administered as the Savings Bank Department.  A separate Advances Department (commonly known as the Credit Foncier Department) which had been operating since 1893 was also formally established.  These two departments operated as independent institutions despite both being the responsibility of the Commissioners.  &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The 1896 Act was originally intended to establish a unified State Bank, hence the use of the term "Department", however all references to this unification were removed from the Bill before it was passed.  This dual division exists today for accounting purposes but does not reflect administrative structure.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Further changes resultant from the 1896 legislation included provision for the appointment of an Inspector-General (to become, in 1923, the position of General Manager) through whom the Commissioners would exercise their control, as well as the transfer of responsibility for Savings Banks legislation from the Chief Secretary to the Treasurer, where it currently remains.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Between 1896 and 1912 the independent Savings Banks of Victoria merged  to become a single institution.  This development was formalized by the Savings Banks Act 1912 (No.2365) which provided for all banks then operating under the Savings Banks Acts to be collectively named The State Savings Bank of Victoria.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Services offered by the State Savings Bank have included:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;   	savings bank facilities&lt;BR /&gt;   	penny savings banks operating in State Schools (from 1912)&lt;BR /&gt;   	safe deposit facilities (from 1913)&lt;BR /&gt;   	special loans to discharged soldiers (from 1917)&lt;BR /&gt;   	building homes for people of small means (from 1920s), including the Garden City estate at Fisherman's Bend&lt;BR /&gt;   	Group Savings Club for workers in factories and offices (from 1927)&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In addition, in 1989 the Bank purchased 49.9% of the Victorian Investment Corporation, previously a public unlisted company owned by the State Government (see VA 2986).  This gave the Bank a role in investing capital in Victorian companies engaged in technological development.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Bank comprised many separate departments providing a full range of savings, trading and merchant bank services through its many branches and agencies (including interstate and international facilities). From 1980 the Bank was known as the State Bank of Victoria under the provisions of the State Bank Act 1980 (No.9458).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1990  1991 the State Bank was sold to the Commonwealth Bank of Australia .&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Judicial Function&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The formal structure of Government including the administration of justice is set down in the Victorian Constitution Act 1975 (No.8750), which re-enacted with additions and amendments the provisions of the 1855 Victorian Constitution Act (passed as a Schedule to the Imperial Act, the Victorian Constitution Statute, 18 and 19 Victoria c.55, proclaimed on 23 November 1855), and the consolidated Constitution Act Amendment Act 1958 (No.6224).  The Constitution Act contains provision for the establishment of the Supreme Court and its Officers (1975 Act sections 75-87).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Judicial Power - the power to make judgments about the constitutional validity of laws, their application and interpretation in particular cases, and the application of laws in settling disputes between  persons, society and individuals, government agencies, and public officials and  persons - is vested in the Courts.  The Constitution ensures the independence of the judiciary by providing for the permanent appointment of judges by the Governor with the advice of the Executive Council, and for their salaries and pension entitlements.  The only lawful means of removing a judge is by the Governor acting upon an address of both Houses of Parliament (1975 Act, sections 75(5) and 77;  1855 Act, section XXXVIII).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;For more detail about the place and role of the judiciary in the Government of Victoria including an explanation of the Courts' role in the creation of unenacted law and the interpretation of enacted law see VRG 17 Executive.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Scope of the Group and Agency Identification&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;This function relates to the records of all Victorian Courts including those of the Supreme Court, the County Court and Magistrates' Courts, previously known as the Courts of Petty Sessions.  It also includes the records of judicial officials such as the Master in Equity and the Registrar of Probate who have exercised both judicial and administrative power.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In most cases the various courts or jurisdictions in each locality have not been identified as separate agencies.  All courts in the following categories have been grouped together:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;   	County Courts prior to 1968&lt;BR /&gt;   	Petty Sessions and Magistrates' Courts&lt;BR /&gt;   	Children's Courts&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In these cases the courts in one locality have been identified as a single agency, e.g. the Dunolly Children's Court and Court of Petty Sessions are included in the agency Dunolly Courts.  In practice it is often the case that the records themselves are also grouped together.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Supreme Court (VA 2549) and its Officers, the County Court (VA 686), the Coroners' Courts 1840-1986 (from 1986 the State Coroner's Office) (VA 2263 and VA 2807), Police Magistrates Districts have been included.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Early Administration of Justice in the Port Phillip District&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Courts function dates from the sitting of the first court in the Port Phillip District in 1836.  On 9 September 1836 the Governor of New South Wales proclaimed the official settlement of the Port Phillip District. Captain William Lonsdale was appointed Police Magistrate of the District on 14September (see VRG 7 and VA 472).  As well as taking responsibility for the general superintendence of the District, he also undertook the duties of a New South Wales District Police Magistrate, including administration of justice and supervision of the local constabulary.  In situations where normal administration of the laws required two Justices, one of the officers accompanying Lonsdale was appointed a "Commissioner of the Peace".  Following the appointment of a Superintendent of the District in 1839, the duties of the Police Magistrate were restricted to responsibility for the local constabulary and local magisterial functions in Melbourne and the position was retitled Police Magistrate, Melbourne.  In the meantime Police Magistrates were being appointed in other localities, Captain Foster Fyans taking up duty in Geelong in late 1837.  The Police Magistrates continued to be responsible for the constabulary within their district until 1853 when responsibility for all police matters was vested in the Chief Commissioner of Police (VA 724 - see also VRG 10 Police).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The first official Courts of Petty Sessions (as distinct from Police District/Magistrates' Courts) were gazetted in the New South Wales Government Gazette of 18 July 1838.  On 14 August 1838, Courts of Quarter Sessions were proclaimed to hear appeals from Courts of Petty Sessions and more serious criminal cases.  The first Court of Requests established to hear civil cases was appointed in 1839 and began sittings in 1840.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Supreme Court&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Prior to separation and the establishment of the Supreme Court in Victoria in 1852 the highest court for the District was the Supreme Court of New South Wales for the District of Port Phillip (VA 914).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Before 1841 this meant that criminal cases and civil litigation of any importance had to be heard in New South Wales.  In 1841, to ease this situation a Resident Judge of the New South Wales Supreme Court for the Port Phillip District was appointed.  In 1852 following separation from New South Wales the Legislative Council passed an Act (15 Vic., No.10) to establish the Supreme Court of Victoria.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Supreme Court (VA 2549) is the highest court of the State, having jurisdiction over all matters, civil and criminal, which have not been excluded by statute.  The 1975 Constitution Act provides for the Supreme Court to consist of not more than thirty judges of whom one is the Chief Justice.  All judges are appointed by the Governor on the advice of the Executive Council from the ranks of practising barristers of not less than eight years standing, and retire at the age of seventy-two years.  At present, the Supreme Court is comprised of a Chief Justice and twenty-one Puisne Judges.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Full Court (usually three, but sometimes five, judges) hears and determines appeals from single judges of the Supreme Court and from the County Court, in both civil matters and criminal cases.  There is no general right of appeal in civil matters from a decision of a Magistrates' Court however a dissatisfied party may apply to have a Supreme Court judge review a case in law. The main activities of the Supreme Court are centred at Melbourne, and judges go "on circuit" to Ballarat, Bendigo, Geelong, Hamilton, Horsham, Sale, Shepparton, Wangaratta and Warrnambool.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Functions of the Court&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Currently the Supreme Court deals with cases such as murder, manslaughter and other criminal matters, civil actions involving large claims and appeals against decisions of the lower courts.  Historically the Supreme Court dealt with matters such as equity, lunacy, divorce and insolvency.  Jurisdiction in some of these matters passed to the Commonwealth at or since federation in 1901, eg. insolvency and bankruptcy in 1928 and divorce in 1976, though the State courts continued to be vested with federal jurisdiction in some cases.  Federal laws regarding divorce and marriage had been passed in 1959 and 1961 respectively and these laws superseded State law.  Under the provisions of the Family Law Act 1975, operational from 5 January 1976, a Family Court of Australia was established to administer Family Law including considerations for the dissolution of marriage.  Appeals against the decisions of the Supreme Court may be heard in the High Court of Australia.  Prior to the passing of the Australia Acts in 1986, appeals could also be heard by the Privy Council, although in recent decades such appeals became increasingly rare.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Officers of the Supreme Court&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Various officers of the Supreme Court exercise or have exercised judicial and/or administrative responsibility.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Master in Equity (also known as the Master in Equity and Lunacy 1867-1923) (VA 2624) was responsible for the administration of matters dealt with under the provisions of the Law of Equity as opposed to those of Common Law and enacted law.  The Master in Equity assisted the Supreme Court;  provided legal opinions on matters referred by the Court;  undertook inquiries and investigations as ordered by the Court;  managed financial matters relating to the court, including payments made by trustees or executors and arranged the payment of costs in equity proceedings, conveyancing and other business of the Court.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Master in Equity was also responsible for the granting of probate in cases where it was considered that probate would be granted by the Supreme Court and for the administration of the estates of deceased persons where the administration of the estate was not contested.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Under the provisions of the Master of the Supreme Court Act 1948 (No.5329) the Master of the Supreme Court (VA 2613) became responsible for those functions previously administered by the Master in Equity (VA 2624) and the Chief Clerk of the Supreme Court, including the granting of probate and administration of the estates of deceased persons where the administration was not contested;  the investigation of matters as directed by a judge of the Supreme Court and the supervision of "committees" appointed by the Court to administer the estates of "lunatics".  Since 1986, the Master of the Supreme Court has been known as the Senior Master and is responsible for the supervision of other officers of the Supreme Court.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 1960, the Master of the Supreme Court ceased to have responsibility for probate and administration.  The Registrar of Probate (VA 2620) who had previously received direction from the Master of the Supreme Court, assumed statutory responsibility for the granting of probate in those cases where it is considered that probate would be granted by the Supreme Court and for the administration of the estates of deceased persons where such grants are uncontested.  Contested estates are determined by the Court.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Prothonotary of the Supreme Court, now also known as the Principal Registrar, oversees the administrative aspects of actions and appeals coming within the jurisdiction of the Court.  Among other things, the Prothonotary is responsible for the issuing of writs and other processes that initiate civil proceedings in the Supreme Court.  The Prothonotary is also responsible for the filing of documents and for the custody of Supreme Court records.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Sheriff administers the Juries Act and is responsible for the enforcement and execution of Supreme Court Writs and Orders and the control and direction of civil warrants issued from Magistrates' Courts and executed by civilian bailiffs.  The Sheriff is also responsible for the security of the Supreme Court, its judges and all persons attending the Court.  &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Under the provisions of An Act to make provision for the better control and disposal of Offenders 16 Vic., No.32, (1853) certain public gaols, prisons, houses of correction etc. were to be under the charge, care and direction of the Sheriff of the Colony of Victoria.  The Sheriff retained responsibility for the supervision of certain prisons until 1871 when, following a Royal Commission on Penal and Prison Discipline, the Statute of Gaols 1864 (No.219) was amended and the Inspector of Penal Establishments became responsible for the supervision of all prisons.  (See the Statute of Gaols Amendment Act 1871 (No.397).)&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;County Court&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The County Court of Victoria is an inferior general court exercising civil, criminal and special jurisdictions.  It also sits as an Appeal Court, without a jury, on appeals from Magistrates' Courts.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;From 1852 to 1968 there were local County Courts which assumed the functions of the Courts of... truncated</description>

       <description type="full">Background&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Separation from New South Wales and Government in the Crown Colony of Victoria 1851-1855 &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Imperial Australian Constitution Act [No. 2] 1850 13 and 14 Vic.,c.59 was enacted following an inquiry by the Privy Council's Committee of Trade and Foreign Plantations into the constitutional position of the Australian colonies and in response to growing agitation in the colonies for reform of governmental structures and for the separation of the Port Phillip District (Lumb p.16-17).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Under this Act the Governor's role was further limited, but he continued to exercise ultimate executive power and significant controls over the legislature and the Colony's finances.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Imperial Australian Constitutions Act [No. 2] 1850 13 and 14 Vic.,c.59 and the Victorian Constitution Act 1851 (New South Wales Act 14 Vic.,No.47) provided for the separation of Victoria from New South Wales from 1 July 1851 and the establishment of a Legislative Council (VA 471).  Legislative power in the new Colony was vested in the Governor and the Legislative Council.  The Governor did not sit in the Council, but exercised discretionary power in assenting or refusing assent to bills.  The Governor could also transmit bills to the Council for consideration.  The Council consisted of thirty members, ten appointed by the Governor on behalf of the Crown, and twenty elected by and from male electors who met specified property qualifications.  By 1853 there were fifty-four elected and eighteen appointed members and by 1855, sixty-three elected and nineteen appointed members (including twelve elected from the goldfields following Eureka).  The appointed members included official and non-official nominees.  The official nominees almost invariably supported Government policy and acted in the Legislative Council on instructions from the Governor (Sweetman, p.124-125).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;There were significant limitations on the legislative powers of Victoria's first Legislative Council.  The control of crown lands, minerals and related revenue was outside its jurisdiction, and there were also limitations on its powers to impose taxes and appropriate revenue for public purposes (e.g. there were fixed appropriations for the Civil List and public worship).  The Governor exercised considerable power over the Colony's finances and appropriations from the General Revenue were made on his recommendation. The Council could not enact laws repugnant to British laws and the courts could invalidate local legislation on repugnancy grounds when hearing a particular case.  Certain classes of bills were reserved for royal assent.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The revenue of the Colony was divided into General and Territorial Revenue.  The Governor with the advice and consent of the Legislative Council had power to appropriate the General Revenue, which derived from taxes, duties, rates and imposts, for local needs.  The Imperial Land Sales Act 1842 5 and 6 Vic.c.36 provided that revenue from the sale of crown land formed the Territorial Revenue and reserved 50% of it for assisted immigration from Britain.  The expenses of the Crown Land and Survey Department were also a charge on the Territorial Revenue.  The remaining "unappropriated moiety" of this fund was expended under the direction of the Governor and Executive Council, eg. on the so-called protection of Aborigines.  During the gold rush revenue from mining licences was also paid into Territorial Revenue and this became a source of agitation in 1851-1852 in the Legislative Council which lobbied the British Government for the right to manage all revenues and refused to appropriate money from the General Revenue to assist in administering the goldfields.  Lieutenant Governor La Trobe was forced to use Territorial Revenue (illegally) for this purpose.  In June 1852 the British Colonial Secretary authorised the surrender of the gold revenue to the Governor and Legislative Council and the use of the unappropriated Territorial Revenue by La Trobe and the Executive Council for the new demands on the administration occasioned by the gold rush.  La Trobe, with the advice of the Executive Council, thenceforth transferred this unappropriated fund to the General Revenue for expenditure authorised by the Legislative Council.  The new Victorian&lt;BR /&gt;Constitution of 1855 was to provide for parliamentary control of all revenue - the Consolidated Revenue (see below and Sweetman p.129-137).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;During the period 1851 to 1855 the executive arm of government was not subject to parliamentary control and ultimate executive power continued to rest with the Governor, who was responsible to the British Government.  The principal officers of the government administration were appointed and dismissed by the Governor on behalf of the British Secretary of State for the Colonies.  In some cases they did sit in the Legislative Council in the period 1851-1856 as appointed members - the Attorney-General and Solicitor-General from 1851;  the Colonial Secretary, Auditor-General and the Surveyor-General, Commissioners of Police and the Goldfields and Chairman of General Sessions between 1851 and 1855;  the Collector of Customs from 1853 (in 1855 the Collector of Customs was restyled to become the Commissioner of Trade and Customs);  the Colonial Engineer in 1854-1855 the Chief Secretary, Treasurer and Commissioner of Public Works from 1855 (Sweetman, p.73-81).  However they were responsible to the Governor and the Imperial Government, not to the Legislative Council, and their executive appointments were not dependent on their retaining their seats in Parliament and the support of the majority in the Lower House, as was the case after 1855.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Victorian Constitution Act 1855&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Australian Constitutions Act (No. 2) of 1850 enabled the Legislative Council in Victoria to legislate to alter the Colony's constitution and establish a two-house legislature, provided such bills were reserved for royal assent.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;A Select Committee of the Legislative Council was appointed on 1 September 1853 to frame a new constitution for Victoria.  The Constitution Bill which resulted followed Lord Durham's Canadian model of responsible government, providing for two elected Houses of Parliament with almost unlimited legislative power and financial control over all revenue and its use.  The Act went beyond its enabling legislation, attempting to limit the role of the Governor in assenting to bills and providing for parliamentary control over crown land and minerals, the imposition of taxes, and all revenue - hence the term Consolidated Revenue - and its appropriation.  Therefore when it was submitted for royal assent, the bill was amended (removing the limitations on the role of the Governor) and then passed as a Schedule to an Imperial enactment, the 1855 Victorian Constitution Statute 18 and 19 Vic.,c.55, which received royal assent on 21 July 1855.  The Victorian Constitution Act was subsequently proclaimed on 23 November 1855.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The new Parliament comprising the Legislative Assembly and the newly constituted Legislative Council, met for the first time on 21 November 1856.  The 1855 Act conferred power on Her Majesty to "make laws for Victoria in all cases whatsoever" -" by and with the advice of the Council and Assembly" (Section 1).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;For both Houses there were originally gender and class (property and educational) qualifications for both members and electors, though suffrage rights were extended to include university graduates, barristers, solicitors, qualified medical practitioners, ministers of religion and retired naval and military officers.  By 1857 the property qualification had been abolished and adult male suffrage had been granted for the Legislative Assembly.  Adult suffrage for women was not granted for Assembly elections until 1908 and propertied women were not eligible to vote for Legislative Council members until 1908 or to stand as candidates for election to either House until 1923.  Voting was made compulsory for the Legislative Assembly elections in 1926.  The property qualification in respect of the Legislative Council continued until 1950.  Aborigines were excluded from the electoral process until 1967.  Persons deemed to be felons or lunatics were also excluded from the electoral process.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Although many of the formal structures embodied in the 1855 Constitution were similar to those in existence prior to this time, the Act contained a number of provisions which established the preconditions for the evolution of conventions that resulted in far reaching changes in the balance of power between the Governor, the principal officers in the administration (the Ministers of the Crown) and the legislature.  Although the Governor continued to exercise legislative, financial and executive powers in a formal sense, he/she did so generally on the advice of the Ministers of the Crown in their capacity as members of the Executive Council.  Real executive power under the new formal arrangements - and in accordance with conventions associated with the notion of responsible government - has rested with the group of Ministers (Cabinet) who hold office with the support of Parliament and are summoned to the Executive Council.  Generally the Governor with the advice of the Executive Council has since 1855 exercised formal power only - in practice this formal process is giving effect to Cabinet and ministerial policy and decisions.  A number of sections of the 1855 Constitution Act provided the formal basis for responsible government, including the appointment of "responsible officers" (Ministers) by the Governor with at least four of these appointments to be made from amongst the members of the Parliament (section XVIII) and the appointment of public officers by the Governor with the advice of the Executive Council.  The 1859 Officials in Parliament Act extended these provisions by specifying that all Ministers of the Crown be appointed as Executive Councillors.   	     &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Formal Structure of Government in Victoria from 1855&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The formal structure of Government is set down in the Victorian Constitution Act 1975 (No.8750), which re-enacted with additions and amendments the provisions of the 1855 Victorian Constitution Act (passed as a Schedule to the Imperial Act, the Victorian Constitution Statute 18 and 19 Vic.55, proclaimed on 23 November 1855), and the consolidated Constitution Act Amendment Act 1958 (No.6224).  Under the Constitution Act, the Victorian Parliament has the power to repeal alter or vary the Act itself, provided that the second and third readings of amending bills are passed by an absolute majority of the members of each House.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Governor (VA 466), represents the Crown in Victoria (1975 Act, section 6). On all official state occasions, the Governor performs ceremonial functions as the representative of the Crown.  The Governor is appointed by the British monarch under Letters Patent accompanied by Royal Instructions which refer to the powers conferred on the Governor by the Constitution Act, which, until 1986, defined classes of bills to be reserved for royal assent, and which provide for the Governor to grant pardons and make grants of Crown Land, and for the Governor to act on the advice of the Executive Council (VA 2903) unless exceptional circumstances arise (clause VI, Royal Instructions).  The State Government advises the monarch on the appointment of the Governor, this advice being routed through the British Commonwealth and Foreign Office until 1986 when the Australia Acts enabled the Premier to tender advice directly to the Queen.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Legislative or law making power is vested in Parliament comprising the Crown and two elected Houses, the Legislative Assembly (VA 2585) and the... truncated</description>
